<h2>            bluetooth support service disabled somehow</h2>
                    Bluetooth Support Service disabled itself somehow on my gateway NV53A windows 7 x64 laptop. Can't change it to start in manual or automatic or other setting. When I try it says "system cannot find path specified". Path is C:Windows\system32\svchost.exe
 -k bthsvcs. Anybody have an idea or experience on how to rectify this matter? Assistance would be appreciated

            Its the adaptive brightness feature in Windows 10. You can turn it off by opening Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display 
<br />
<br />Uncheck 'Change brightness automatically when lighting changes'

            Hi Lorraine, please don't Phone that number above - that user is a Tech support spammer and will be removed soon . . .
<br />
<br />Lorraine, with regards to your dimming problem, go into Power Options and check to see if Brightness is set differently for Battery and on Power as pictured below:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6efe578f-e383-4e90-bbf5-075da472ceec?upload=true" />

    <title>Iomega Errors with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliettetodd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Iomega Errors with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Surface Book running, of course, Windows 10. I am trying to transfer my files from my old Sony VAIO, running Windows 7, as well as generally be able to access my external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Iomega external hard drive. I'm not sure of other specifics about it, except that it's 1 TB, model LPHD-UP3, and I've had it for a few years. I can continue to access on the Sony VAIO without issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, when I tried plugging it into the Surface Book, it didn't recognize it. I was finally able to prompt recognition by uninstalling the USB drives then restarting. It continued to have issues with keeping recognized -- I had to keep unlocking it
 via the encryption utility. But, I was moving files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, tonight I can't get the encryption utility to recognize that it's plugged in. I've tried the USB trick, I've run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter, I've gone to Disk Management. USB does nothing, the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter told
 me to install two separate unknown drives' software then restart, but when I did that nothing changed and in fact running the Troubleshooter produced exactly the same results (plus some errors with the pen? but that works fine?). In Disk Management, it wanted
 me to initialize the disk, but I wasn't about to lose all that data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get Windows 10 to recognize my drive again? I don't understand why it's completely refusing to recognize my drive, when it did a few days ago. The only thing I can think of that's changed is that I installed a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi, thanks for your prompt reply!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I've definitely installed all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-3) I'm not totally sure. I had a weird problem with my printer this morning. It printed a 75% of what I wanted then had an error. A similar thing happened as with the drive: when I troubleshooted, it told me to reinstall the driver software then restart.
 I applied the fix and restarted, but no change. Maybe I misunderstood, though -- I thought it did it when I hit "apply the fix," but maybe I had to manually uninstall or remove it? Because I managed to get the printer working by removing it then plugging it
 back in and having it reinstalled that way, and then it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugging in my phone works fine. It recognizes it immediately and downloads from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when I tried removing/uninstalling the drive, then plugging it in again, that did nothing. It's still not showing up as connected, though it's listed in devices and drivers as LPHD-UP3. In properties, it's identified as a storage device, but
 everything else is unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by device you meant the surface book, then again it seems to work just fine with the Sony VAIO running Windows 7.0 still. If I plug it in right now, everything's good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Iomega has this program, at least on this drive, that permits you to lock it. So when you connect it to a computer, the device shows up, but you can't access the files. Instead it shows the drive and the program on it, which must be run and the password
 entered. Then all the files can be accessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this computer, I could never get it to properly recognize the drive, but I could open my installed iomega drive protection dashboard, which would recognize the drive and let me enter the password. However, that no longer recognizes it. Instead it says
 "please attach &nbsp;a supported external device." Again, this same software has no problem on the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I wasn't sure, because it's not blue. There's a blue port that matches up with a blue USB on the device? But when I plugged it in to have it reinstall the software (which it didn't seem to), the computer did say that it was connected to a 3.0 USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Methods: &nbsp;Sadly, no good for 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 2, I actually also tried that before asking here, and that also didn't work. I feel like that may have been the problem when it WAS working, as to why it sometimes disconnected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3, There really don't seem to be any pending updates. I'm up to date. There's also no updated driver software for me to find. It's very strange. I'd understand if it plainly wasn't compatible because it's too strange. What I don't understand is why it worked
 earlier this week, then stopped. ):</p>

            <p>try this:</p>
<p>* uninstall the previous iomega encryption software</p>
<p>* install the latest version you can get here:&nbsp;https://lenovo-eu-en.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26020/related/1</p>
<p>* go to the folder where you installed it (normally C:\Program Files (x86)\Iomega\Iomega Encryption )</p>
<p>* at the top there is a folder called "Drivers" and then a folder "RemoteComms" with "RemoteCommsInstaller.exe" in it</p>
<p>* run this program once and go back up to the iomega encryption folder</p>
<p>* if you now run the "Iomega Encryption.exe" it should work</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I don't want to get rid of the app, just puzzles I no longer want to put together in the app. You acquire the puzzles by points that you accumulate or you buy them. You can only put them together so many times before you are able to
 do this in your sleep. The puzzles I have completed are the ones I want to get rid of. Right clicking does nothing.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Do I need to install the DirectX End-User Runtime&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmdrkeene  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I need to install the DirectX End-User Runtime&#63;</h2>
                    Today on the Microsoft.com homepage, is a full-width Silverlight banner and one section is a link to "Get the DirectX update".&nbsp; Clicking the link takes you
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
That download page says the download is for Windows 7 (and practically every other OS made in the past decade)... but do I need it?&nbsp; I don't understand why I would install DirectX 9.anything when I'm on Windows 7, which is already using a newer version of DirectX.<br />
<br />
I'm a tech person.&nbsp; I live and dream MSDN and TechNet, I know every best practice and read KB articles for fun... so if I'm confused about this, I can't imagine how confused any normal user is when they see a banner telling them to install DirectX 9.<br />
<br />
Help?<br />

    <title>How To Safe Mode Without A Login Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnlee1811  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Safe Mode Without A Login Screen</h2>
                    <p>After an update in Windows 10 (64-bit), I became stuck on a perpetual black background when I try logging in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following a few suggestions online about entering in safe mode, I got into Systems Configuration (by typing msconfig on RUN prompt) but mistakenly left the Diagnostic startup on at the general tab as well as Safe boot checked at Boot tab. Now when I restart,
 the system no longer shows a login page. It only shows the three icons at the lower right which is the Wi-Fi, Access, and Power. When I do the shift+Restart at Power icon, it doesn't bring me back to Safe Mode. Instead the process repeats itself by going to
 the Windows welcome again without a login form and with only the three icons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go back to safe mode to change the System Config to normal startup? </p>
<p>
</p><p>And how do I get out of the perpetual black background with cursor?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi John,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may access <strong>Safe mode</strong> in <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> by making your computer think that the startup is failing.
<strong>Windows&nbsp;Recovery Environment </strong>(WinRE) is a recovery environment that can repair common causes of unbootable operating systems. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on your computer.</li><li>When you see the loading dots, immediately turn off your computer.</li><li>Repeat steps one and two. Three times will be enough for the computer to think that you are having issues with start up.</li><li>Once the computer boots up for the third time, you will see the loading dots on the screen and the message
<strong>Preparing automatic repair</strong>.</li><li>Afterwards, your PC may turn blank then it will show <strong>Diagnosing your PC</strong>.</li><li>It will ask you to restart your device or proceed to the advanced options.</li><li>Choose <strong>Advance Options</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're in the Windows Recovery Environment, you may go to <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings to access Safe Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I encountered the BSOD&nbsp;&nbsp;system_service_exception. I executed verifier.exe as described by zigzag3143 to track down the mis-behaving driver. I rebooted and windows wouldn't boot due to another BSOD&nbsp;driver_verifier_detected_violation. So I went into safe mode
 and retrieved the DMP files and here they are:</p>

<h2>            xbox one Microphone problems</h2>
                    <p>My kids xbox one game console has a line through the microphone on the screen and the microphone will not work.</p>
<p>We have tried multiple headsets, and still not working.</p>
<p>Is there an easy fix for this problem ?</p>
<p>We have checked basics, like mute buttons on the headsets ,turned the console off , updating console, hold power off for 15 seconds, remove power cord,try different headsets.</p>
<p>We bought a brand new headset and it has never worked on the xbox, but&nbsp; it works on my iphone 6&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, especially by my 2 kids,</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Have you checked to see if your controllers need a software update or even the headsets too? Some headsets require updates from the manufacturer websites to continue working properly.

<p>Have your kid try the following:</p>
<p>With the headset connected to the controller, and the controller connected with a Micro USB cable (be sure it's a USB data cable, not a smartphone charging cable which often lacks the data lines to save money), launch the Xbox Accessories app, and check
 that the controller has an up-to-date firmware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is up-to-date, have the kid compose a message to a friend (they don't have to send the message, so it doesn't matter to whom they send it to).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of typing the message, have the kid press the Microphone icon, and record the voice message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After recording the message, you can listen to your own voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the Microphone work with the voice message?</p>
<p>If not, it might be that the controller is defective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the voice message worked, but Party chat doesn't, it might be a network problem, or your kid accidentally pressed X on the party screen and muted themselves in the party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For network issues, check the NAT status in the network settings of the console. Make sure the NAT is shown as "open".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to open a NAT, you need to configure your internet router, as NAT is not a setting in the console, but a method to connect to specific devices "behind" a router, that bundles several devices (like your PC, smartphones, tablets and consoles) through
 one public internet connection.</p>

<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of troubleshooting you can try. Some you may have done some you may not of. Number 9 seems to work for quite a few people.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>1.) power cycle console</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>2.)</span></span><span><span>Go
 to settings&gt; Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt; Assign controller to account&gt; Update control&gt; unassign account&gt; test headset/chat</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>3.)</span></span><span><span>Make
 sure mic is "ON" Press the home button&gt; go to the Gear on the&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>menu&gt; Audio&gt; Turn Mic off and on. OR go to settings</span></span><span><span>&gt;
 Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt;</span></span><span><span>Audio&gt; Mic on&gt; Adjust volume.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>4.)</span></span><span><span>You
 can test your controller if it is broken by "Buzzing" the controller. The buzz feature is connected to the headset port, and if the controller does not buzz then the port may be damaged.
</span></span><span><span>[Turning on Vibration if it does not "Buzz"&gt; Settings&gt; Ease of Access&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Controller&gt; Vibration Settings&gt; Turn on Vibration].</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>5.)</span></span><span><span>Some
 mics are detachable and may be damaged so try testing the headset on another device to see if it works (Example: windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Test
 the Headset with Skype Test or Voice Recorder). If there is an issue with using the headset on an Xbox controller,&nbsp; you can try using a headset adaptor.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>6.) Make sure there is no Enforcement on the account.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>7.) Make sure the controller is not full of dust in the headset
 port (you can use compressed air to clear the dust).</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>8..) Make sure controller is fully charged/ change battery
 type.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>9.) Use a headset adapter or standard headphones (Main fix)</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>10) Soft or full console reset. (may not work all the time)</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi Brad, thanks for the info.</p>
<p>We struggle at step 3, when we get to Audio, it skips over the volume and I do not see an option for Mic on adjust volume.</p>
<p>We have tried all the other steps except for 9</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have 2 unhappy kids !</p>

</p><p>That would be the adapter you need. The headset will plug into that. With some&nbsp; third party headsets the volume will be blacked out.</p>

<h2>            disk i&#47;o errors reported by paragon disk wiper 10 when operating under Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi First time trying this forum.</p>
<p>Disk wiper 10 personal edition when operating under windows 7 64 bit home premium reports I/O errors when I try to wipe free space using the Paragon algorithm. Same problem occured with same hardware when using 32 bit XP Pro. Problem is not specific to a
 hard drive. Have identical SATA drives and older IDE drives and fails on all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Works fine using the paragon boot disk so I am assuming the hardware is ok. The disk wiper program goes into a loop regardless of clicking option to try again or cancel
 and has to be stopped with task manager. Windows and all drivers up to date. Processor is AMD Quad core Phenom 2 965 with Gigabyte GA-770T-USB3 version 1.0 motherboard and 4 x KINGSTON ValueRam 2GB 1333MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 DIM. SATA drives are WD5001AALS-00F41A0.
 Has anyone any ideas other than talk to Paragon again. Have tried in safe mode and under diagnostic start up but same every time.</p>

<h2>            MSACM32.DLL &#38; Microsoft Audio Services</h2>
                    <p>Howdy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I reluctantly upgraded from Win7 Ultimate (which I'm running on the other machines in the house) because I was having the same problem with that that I'm having with Win10 now.&nbsp; I keep getting a MSACM32.dll error message when
 starting any application that uses Microsoft Audio Services.&nbsp; My speaker is X's in the systray.&nbsp; My wifi doesn't work, and the wired internet connection is moody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read the other posts on this topic.&nbsp; I've run SFC /scannow from the administrator command prompt.&nbsp; I've restarted into the safe mode and tried the automatic repair from the advanced troubleshooting page.&nbsp; I made a WIn10 disk and I've tried repairing
 Windows using that.&nbsp; I've run scans with Avast, AVG, MalwareBytes, and Hitman and fixed any problems they've come up with.&nbsp; I've reinstalled all the motherboard drivers.&nbsp; I've run Windows Update.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't done (and which I don't want to do
 because I think it's a lazy suggestion) is wipe the drive and reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I still get a corrupted MSACM32.dll error.&nbsp; I don't know how to open the file to look at it.&nbsp; Notepad doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So if anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, as an aside, when I try repairing windows, it tells me it cannot complete the procedure and that it doesn't make any changes.&nbsp; All I really need to do is replace MSACM32.dll with an uncorrupted version of the file ... but I don't know how to do that.</p>

            <p>Howdy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't get into the device manager.&nbsp; I get an error (white box with red header) that says, "this program has been blocked for your protection.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; An administrator has blocked this program:&nbsp; mmc.exe."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I only have one user account, and it's an administrator account.&nbsp; I don't know what this error is talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I uninstalled all audio/video drivers and programs (NVIDIA Experience, &amp;c.) and then reinstalled them with no improvement.&nbsp; I also keep getting the bad image error for MSACM32.dll.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the feedback Rob. Since you already tried multiple troubleshooting steps, our next course of action is to perform a
<strong>reset</strong>. You can refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to reset your PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thing about doing a reset is that, it will let you choose to either remove or keep your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

            <p>That information indicates there may be nothing wrong with the MSACM32.dll which may explain why the System File Checker did not indicate any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide the following information which may help determine&nbsp;any issue(s):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp; &gt; OK &gt;&nbsp;File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via&nbsp;a public folder on OneDrive&nbsp;or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp;&gt; OK&nbsp;&gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some users have reported AVG may quarantine a needed audio file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there appears to be two real-time antivirus software installed, AVG and Avast, and that can cause stability issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to suggest to uninstall both AVG and Avast and use Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be temporary to see if issue(s) resolve.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems preexists AVG on my system.&nbsp; The audio services have been stopped for a while, but I don't know what caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always run Avast.&nbsp; I added Malbyteworks, AVG, and Hitman to see if they ran across anything that Avast was missing.&nbsp; The ploy didn't turn up anything new.&nbsp; So, coincidentally, I was uninstalling the lot this morning.&nbsp; I also uninstalled Avast,
 as you suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, when I start Defender, I'm getting an error that says "Microsoft Security Center:&nbsp; The application isn't initializing ... or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also hoping that the two WIn10 (1607) updates will work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>rkr</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh, audio services are still not running.</p>

    <title>XBox One Controller Blinking despite charged battery&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctor punjabi  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One Controller Blinking despite charged battery&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>What does it mean when my XBox One controller keeps blinking despite inserting charged batteries? &nbsp;The same batteries work in my first controller, but this second controller I just bought has the light blink when I try to turn it on... and it keeps blinking
 a few seconds then the light turns off. &nbsp;How do I fix this and get the second controller to work because I want to play a 2 player game.</p>

<p>You've probably already resolved this problem... But just in case, or for future gaming reference... Try pairing your 2nd controller. The 2nd controller always has to be paired in order to be activated.
</p>
<p>There's a tiny button on the front of the controller. And another button of the side of the Console. (Like directly left of the console, should be part of the front button, but on the side if that makes sense. It's black) Press and Hold that button and the
 &nbsp;the tiny button on the controller (at the same time) until the flashing light goes solid. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your controller should now be paired and functional. </p>

<p>Same thing happened to me, and I was disappointed at first. I fixed the problem when I noticed my 2nd controller did the same thing. All I did was disconnect the power brick for a bit then it worked. Thanks for not failing me Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Windows DVD Player App stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trentonphillips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD Player App stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the Windows DVD Player App on my computer laptop for 8 months.&nbsp; I use it to watch recorded class videos.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, I needed to pay over 10 dollars to download this app.&nbsp; The price for the app was no issue because the app worked perfectly
 for my recorded classes and DVD movies until now.&nbsp; This morning, an update was installed on my computer(I do not know exactly which update it was, nor do I know what it affected).&nbsp; When I tried to use the Windows DVD Player App, as I always do each day, it
 opened with the loading screen (which shows that it is trying to play the inserted disc) and then it force closed.</p>
<p>I repeated this process a few times.&nbsp; I ejected the disc that&nbsp;I wished to watch and inserted a music CD (that would not require a DVD playing app) and the music played fine.&nbsp; The problem is not my external USB disc player.&nbsp; So I proceeded to uninstall the
 Windows DVD Player App.&nbsp; After I downloaded it from the Windows Store I hoped it would work. It did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise and assist.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Trenton, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persist after installing the updates, we recommend restoring your computer to its previous state where the update isn't yet applied using a
<strong>System Restore</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start button</strong> and select <strong>Run.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>rstrui.exe</strong></li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the System Restore.</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do as you suggested.&nbsp; When I entered rstrui.exe into the "Run" tab, a new window told me that System Protection was disabled on my laptop computer.&nbsp; I activated System Protection and another window opened telling me that "No restore points have
 been created on your computer's system drive." To create a restore point now would not do any good because I want to be able to go back to the previous system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other solutions?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried several languages, InPrivate browsing, I don't have 3th party firewalls installed and disabled the windows one. Do not have antivirus software installed and even tried to download it on my MacBook (just to be sure it was not my PC). Also tried
 different browsers (edge, IE, chrome). Unfortunatly nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of moment I receive a gateway timeout with this errorcode:</p>

<br />
===========================================================</p>
<p><br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</font></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            <p>2 days now with older version of kaspersky ( 2012 now)</p>
<p>no problem at all </p>
<p>i was sure it wasn't vmware becuase the minidumb before installing vmware had the same error but one with modem network &amp; one with LAN connection so i remembered from ur suggestion that kaspersky has drivers &amp; control over network
</p>
<p>so that's why the minidumb contain different connection error </p>
<p>i hope kaspersky fix 2013 product so i can use it again </p>
<p>thanks guys u were very helpful </p>
<p>&amp; wish me luck that the problem has been fixed</p>
<p>Thanks Again</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Glad to have helped. Sounds like you did some excellent troubleshooting!<br />
<br />
Correct, an antivirus checks and operates at so many levels that it can cause such issues<br />
while it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;seem something else created the problem. That is why when I saw in<br />
the minidump you were running Kaspersky experience said it could be the real culprit<br />
or at least involved.<br />
<br />
Take me to the river tonight,</p>

<p>~</p>
<p>I agree that Waypoint isn't the best site out there, but for now it's fine. I really just hope they have an awesome site for Halo 4's stats and files.</p>

<p>I personally really enjoy Halo Waypoint. I think the stat tracking is just fine for my needs, and I really enjoy the interface and the way they have things laid out.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Yeah, it took them a while to get files up, but everything you could need from Bungie.net is on Halo Waypoint now. Except... nameplates and film conversions. But at least 343 give you a full 24 slot fileshare!</p>

<p>I finally loaded Waypoint last night to check it out. &nbsp;A little overwhelming at first trying to figure out what all the random points are for. &nbsp;Only spent a few minutes on there but will check it out more whenever I have the time.

            Hi WR.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See how to remove duplicate files in Windows 10:
<br /><a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/remove-duplicate-files-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/remove-dupli...</a>
<br />
<br />Is your User pictures folder moved into OneDrive using Folder Protection as shown here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a> ?
<br />
<br />If so use the User account Pictures folder for finding duplicates.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            windows 8 program immediately minimizes itself when starting to the taskbar and won&#39;t open</h2>
                    I am using Windows 8 Pro with Media Center upgraded from Windows 7 Pro. <br />
Any programs I open will automatically minimize and I cannot maximize the program to use it. If I click on the minimized task bar icon, the window for the program pops open for a second and then minimizes again. It will do this for some programs for a short
 time and then allows me to maximize them, others will not open no matter what.<br />

            I'm in the UK and upgraded yesterday and can't get it to work. I've downloaded the English language pack, still nothing.... Really frustrated as wanted to try this out.

            When I use the option to have Cortana learn my voice I can use Cortana after I've spoken the 6 lines she asks me to speak, but as soon as I restart the PC it is switched off again. And then displays the message that my region isn't supported.

    <title>Windows 10 apparent registry problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scribblegum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 apparent registry problem</h2>
                    <p>I reinstalled Windows 10 on a MacBook Pro using Parallels (why I did this is not really relevant, I think).</p>
<p>Now I can run the programs that I really want to run (which mainly is just two programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to move a shortcut to the desktop I get the error: "0x800401E5: No object for moniker" and cannot complete the move.</p>
<p>Another indicator is that some programs that I can run do not appear on the list in "Uninstall or change a program" within Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect the problem is an error(s) in the registry, but I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could re-install of Windows again, but I expect there is a better approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice welcome.</p>

            What happens if you do this.
<br />
<br />In the VM, press Windows key + R - I believe this would be Command + R on the Mac
<br />
<br />This should open the Run box.
<br />
<br />Type: shell:appsfolder
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Resize the window
<br />
<br />Try drag and drop the shortcut from there to the desktop.
<br />
<br />Do you still get the error?
<br />
<br />If you do, try the following.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If they don't help, you might have to do a repair upgrade:

<p>Something short of re-installing all of Windows that I would try is creating a new Windows user profile. There's a part of the registry that's&nbsp;user-specific and created from scratch for each new user. (You'd have to move any documents, pictures, etc over
 to the new profile, but until you deleted the old user, you could easily go back to get anything you overlooked.) As the desktop is user-specific, I wouldn't be surprised if the cause of that error were in the user-specific portion of the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First step: try creating a new Windows user profile, log in as it, and see if it suffers the same problem. If it doesn't, then consider just moving your files over and being done with it. If it does, then we've learned a little bit more about where the problem
 must lie. Let us know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear it. You're welcome. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, unless you're really pressed for the disk space, I'd encourage you to keep your old user profile around for quite a while, long enough that you've verified that you can use all your apps as you expect. Just like on macOS, a lot of Windows programs
 stow their data in hidden places within the user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dad's bacon was recently saved by my having backed up his *entire* user profile (rather than just his Docs and Pics) before he reinstalled Windows 10. He'd forgotten about his password manager database.<br />

            Thanks for that advice. I set up the new user as Administrator, because I am the only user of the computer. I seem to have full access to everything. I am actually using only two applications on the Windows side, because they are the only applications
 of interest that do not run on the Mac.
