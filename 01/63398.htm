<p>My roommate and I set up an Xbox One file share and he digitally bought a super deluxe edition of NHL 17 which allows him to get certain addons and I preordered the Kobe edition of 2K17, will both of us be able to get the added benefits of buying the special
 edition games?</p>

<p>Typically setting another console as a home console to allow &nbsp;other uses to have access to the "game" isn't intended to Gameshare but lets assume its a roomate or extended family :-)</p>
<p>The part that is accessible for others is only the game. &nbsp;Any DLC, addons, packages or bonuses other than the base game will not be accessible by others. &nbsp;Understand most of this is tied to the gamertag and not the console so my suggestion is that both of
 you make a purchase or one of you will miss out on anything other than the game.</p>
<p>As described it seems this is being done intentionally for benefits so be careful as there could be negative impacts down the road but specific to your question.....this is not designed to work as you desire it to.</p>

<p>No</p>

<h2>            cant reinstall all windows 10 base apps</h2>
                    <p>hey guys i need some help.....ok long story short after futsing around trying to make several things work after the nov update and failing i gave up and stepped back windows 10 to the previous RTM build...and whala all those things that didnt work now worked
 again...but in doing so i created a new problem. all my base apps that came with windows 10 stoped working....so i went online and found the long command string for powershell that reinstalls all the windows 10 base apps....but when i run it, it reinstalls
 some apps but wont reinstall others saying that there is already newer versions of the apps already installed....but the newer versions dont work in RTM so how do i get it to uninstall all the base apps so i can reinstall the older versions. i really dont
 want to wipe windows and reinstall the os from scratch and have to reinstall all my other software which is working just fine...all i want to do is reinstall the base apps......i'm running windows 10 RTM 64bit. on the problem machine......thanks,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

            <p>hey thanks for responding...ok i have 2 user accounts on this machine the main account jason and a everquest 2 account for gaming......when im logged in as jason and i click on an app like calculator it starts opening poping up a window on the screen for
 half a second and then dissapears.....same with all the other apps photos, windows store, calander, etc.....when i login to my everquest 2 user and i click on calculator off the start menu nothing happens at all same with all the other base apps.....</p>
<p>i have tried to run power shell and reinstall the apps using this command :</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Get-AppxPackage -allusers | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -register "$($_.InstallLocation)\appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode}</span></p>
<p>result is it installs some apps just fine but gives me red errors on all the main apps saying a newer version is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i followed the link and downloaded the app troubleshooter and ran it and it was useless.....it could not detect any problems!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>all my aftermarket 3rd party apps work just fine...office 2016, adobe photoshop cs6, google chrome avast antivirus etc....the only apps not working are the base ones that came with windows..</p>
<p>when i stepped back the machine to a previous build it gave me a message saying that some apps would need to be reinstalled.</p>

            <p>hey guys thanks for your help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried the sfc option and sfc didnt fix anything all system files were good. and then i found these repair instructions on the internet and this fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need? Windows 10 ISO (unpacked) on a USB Stick and most important SOME PATIENCE! :)<br />
<br />
Step 1: Delete All Packages Files<br />
<br />
-Login to the local user with Admin rights.<br />
-Go to C:\Program Files<br />
-Right Click on the "WindowsApps" folder And set the ownership of the folder and all the sub-folders to the local user<br />
-Go into the "WindowsApps" Folder. (Path: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps). Now delete all the folders in this location<br />
<br />
Step 2: Reinstall Windows 10<br />
<br />
-Insert the USB stick with Windows 10 Install on it and Double Click on Setup<br />
-make shure Download All updates is checked.<br />
-When Prompted select the "Keep Personal Files and App" check box. Failing to do so will result in you loosing all your files and installed Apps (Softwares) you don't want that<br />
-Continue with the install. Ideally it takes around 30-40 minutes to fully re-install windows 10. It is way better than spending day's looking for a solutions. It does not exist.<br />
<br />
Once Windows 10 is re-installed OR some of you might wanna call it an "In-Place Upgrade" is finished You should have all your Files and Apps already installed and you should be ready to go. Oh, and yes the Built-in Apps will be working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this solution worked for me and i hope it helps anyone else with this same issue.</p>
<p>thanks, jason</p>

            <p>There is no update history, doesn't record that their was an update attempted. I've manually tried the updates with suggested settings around a dozen times not including that times that it tries to update from the automatic software update settings in windows
 8.1. the update always stops at 30% and does a reboot and then resumes update and stops at 75% and after reboot it then it starts the recovery which it tries 2 more times each time rebooting before my logon screen comes back. One thing it always does is I
 loose my Internet explorer from my desktop icons and start screen, I have to go back and reset the microsoft default programs to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I forgot to mention is that the original hard drive that windows 8.0 was installed to was moved as a secondary drive and a SSD drive was added as the primary drive for boot purposes because of the speed. I only recently found out that I was unable
 to download the 8.1 ISO file using my current software key because of the hardware change so I could refresh the install to try to get the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB2919355 update on Windows 8.1 which my computer is currently

            <p>Same as others. KB2919355. No error code, just "undoing changes". Tries again in same reboot sequence but fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Win 8.1 Pro. Started with Win 8 and updated to 8.1, still on the same HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really is a pain because it means I have to install all updates manually, making sure I uncheck KB2919355. If I set it to install updates automatically, then I have to wait 10minutes while it reboots and fails to install KB2919355.</p>

            The last two times I have attempted the manual install of KB2919355, it appears to succeed until the very end when I get the "we couldn't complete updates, undoing changes" message. On both of these occasions I have gotten error code 800F0922. In between
 I have attempted an to install via Windows Update and got a different error code (80246007). It is not the VPN client as I had already uninstalled it in an effort to get this update installed. I have now been working on this for two weeks, have tried everything
 suggested in the forums and on the MS site all to no avail. I don't know what else to do.

            <p>I received this error while updating (or trying) this evening.&nbsp; I was afraid it would never boot to the sign in screen, but it did.&nbsp; Update history shows several updates installed today, but "Security Update for IE 11 for Windows 8.1 for x64 based systems
 (KB2961851) without KB2919355" failed.&nbsp; What do I do?!I am currently using FireFox and have changed my update preferences to non-automatic.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit - 12 of ~15 updates that I tried to install today failed</p>
<p>I tried this tool:&nbsp; <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
go.microsoft.com/?linkid=</a></p>
<p>It fixed several issues, but some were unsuccessful.&nbsp; This is the report:</p>

            Paul, of Microsoft, had me look at my Disk Management and thinks that I have a System Partition that is to small.&nbsp; It's 260MB and he thinks it should be bigger.&nbsp; He thinks this is what is causing the failure.&nbsp; He is to get back to me tomorrow with a firm
 answer.&nbsp; The error Code 800f0922 led him to this conclusion since I don't have a VPN Connection set up.&nbsp; Maybe this will help you.&nbsp; Hal<br />

<h3> pleasehelpmicrosoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            EasySuite USB data transfer doesn&#39;t work after the newest Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>So I have EasySuite which lets me transfer files and data from one computer to another, and it's always worked. But suddenly, right after the newest windows update I was forced into, it doesn't work anymore. I double click on the application and it shuts
 off as soon as it opens. I was told by another Microsoft employee to just reinstall the program, but you are not able to reinstall it, it's a program that you run when you plug the USB into your computer. I haven't been able to solve this for days and I desperately
 need to get these files over to my other computer. I've also learned that it may have something to do with SMBv1</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            It sounds like the changes made to network sharing in Verison 1803 might have affected this transfer program.  How exactly does it work?
<br />
<br />If it's only a matter of copying files onto a stick to transfer to another PC where you copy them off the stick, this doesn't really require a program.  I'm not saying you shouldn't have one, and that it should work and not be messed up by more buggy Windows Updates, just that there may be a way we can help you do this if this program isn't going to work any longer.  
<br />
<br />If you're open to it here is a tutorial on the Many Ways to Copy, Delete or Move multiple Files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>  you could treat the flash stick as a drive to copy onto and then off of manually.  This is how most use one.  I've never seen a program that does it better.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Yes, you are able to free roam and collect things you might have missed or couldn't get early in the game because you might not have had the equipment at the time without having to start over.

<p>yeah, I'm still playing the game on 3 different levels...easy, med and almost done with the hard level. Once I find a 'new' riddle or whatever, I go and find it again in the other levels, too.</p>
<p>The hard level is really that....super hard. I've finished the story mode on the other tow levels relatively quickly, though. I was stuck at the part with Bane for the longest time...over a month or two until a week ago.

    <title>Dell Inspiron has no sound and has WMP 11 issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chili fries  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Inspiron has no sound and has WMP 11 issues</h2>
                    Hi, I'm running Vista Home Premium SP1 on my Dell 1420 Inspiron laptop. It's about 2 months old and was working perfectly until a few nights ago. It went to sleep overnight and when I used it the next day I had no sound. The only thing that changed was
 the computer went to sleep and had a Windows update before it went to sleep. <br />
<br />
In addition to not having any sound, WMP 11 stopped playing any audio files. It gives me the error "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file. For additional assistance, click Web Help" when I try to play any audio file. It will play
 video but not the accompanying audio. I also use the VLC media player, which will play files but I don't get any sound. The Windows sounds don't work either, not the startup sound or anything like that. Also, iTunes won't play any files. When I click on a
 song nothing happens, the time counter doesn't move.<br />
<br />
I've talked with Dell support multiple times. I've updated my drivers, when I check my device manager it says the Sigma Tel HD Audio CODEC is working properly. I removed my driver and reinstalled it. I rolled back my Windows updates and went back to a system
 restore point but nothing worked. I've also run diagnostic tests on startup which show the hardware is working properly, I can hear the generated test tones. But in normal Windows use I hear nothing. Dell's solution is to back up all my data and reset to factory
 configuration but I'd prefer not to have to go to all that trouble, I have over 100 gigabytes and a lot of programs on my computer.<br />
<br />
The Dell tech believes it might be a corrupt WMP 11. I also saw a Microsoft troubleshooting article called
<br />
"A high definition audio device may no longer work after you resume Windows Vista from hibernation or sleep". That gives an update to install, 937077,&nbsp; but when I tried to install it I got a message saying it isn't applicable to my system, I guess because I
 already have SP1.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any help, I am at my wits' end. I'll check this thread very regularly to communicate with anyone who can help me. Thank you.<br />

<p>To perform an Installation Repair (In Place Upgrade) verify the following:<br />
<br />
If you have non Service Pack 1 media&nbsp; but have Service Pack 1 installed on your Operating System you will need to uninstall Service Pack 1 before doing your repair (the Service Pack number on the CD and the Operating System have to match in order to do a repair)<br />
<br />
An In Place Upgrade (Repair Install) will not erase any installed programs or documents but
<b>Please Perform a Backup just to be safe</b><br />
<br />
Insert your CD into your drive while Windows is loaded, you are not able to perform a Repair Installation (In Place Upgrade) while booting from the CD</p>

-Click Continue if prompted by UAC<br />
-Click the Install now button<br />
-Click Go Online to get the latest updates for installation<br />
-Do not enter a product key, uncheck the box to Automatically activate Windows when I'm online<br />
-Click Next and No when asked it you want to enter a product key<br />
-Be sure to select your correct edition of Windows, if you are repairing a Home Premium installation then be sure to select Home Premium etc<br />
-Check the box indicating "I have selected the edition of Windows that I purchased" and click Next<br />
-Choose the upgrade option<br />
</p>
<p>Here is also an explanation of the Repair options available when booting from the CD</p>
<p><b>Startup Repair</b> - This option will attempt to repair any startup
 or boot options that your computer is experiencing stopping Windows from starting<br />
<br />
<b>System Restore</b> - This option will restore your computer to an earlier date.&nbsp; Any applications installed after the date chosen will be uninstalled but all documents and data will not be overwritten.&nbsp; This option
 is also available in Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>Windows Complete Restore</b> - This option allows you to restore your computer from previously created backup images<br />
<br />
<b>Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool </b>- This option will scan your memory hardware for any errors<br />
<br />
<b>Command Prompt - </b>This option will take you to a DOS Command Prompt<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>But given that your other Win 7 systems give you a device specific icon for your printer, I suspect that all you need to do on this system is check the appropriate box as shown here --&gt;

<h2>            Application Not Found Whenever I try to open anything</h2>
                    <p>So my computer has been fine up until last night. I was trying to open my discord app when I first got an error message saying 'No Such Interface Supported'. Well i tried looking up some possible ways to fix this but it seems i might have made it worse I'm
 not sure. I have gone into the&nbsp;Registry Editor and tried changing the .exe &amp; exefile folders. Nothing has worked for me. Also in order for me to run any of the apps I'm currently not able to use i need to run the app as&nbsp;administrator. For example I can't open
 google chrome normally because it gives me this window&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/492f72f5-699b-4b31-a316-dd55f9408499?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/492f72f5-699b-4b31-a316-dd55f9408499?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me that window with most of the applications I try to use and the other error message I get is this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a269704c-a0a9-4af1-b2fd-b469dd0fe636?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a269704c-a0a9-4af1-b2fd-b469dd0fe636?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>(or whatever other app I open) also anything I download won't let open as well&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25b25c42-546c-4a45-9aa0-b024889b5b52?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25b25c42-546c-4a45-9aa0-b024889b5b52?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried resetting the Registry Editor even in safe mode.</p>
<p>I can't even hard reset because some error occurs so thats out the window...</p>
<p><br />
If anyone knows how this can fixed I would glady&nbsp;appreciate it. I just want to use my PC like I use too.</p>

            I think you need to restore your system to default settings:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + I 
<br />2. Click on "Update and Security" 
<br />3. Click on "Restore" 
<br />4. Click on "Start" 
<br />5. Click on "keep my files and apps"

<h2>            Computer crashes randomly without notice or pattern</h2>
                    <p>For the last two weeks or so my computer will simply freeze up/crash without provocation. Freezing on whatever screen it was on and making a stuttering sound if anything was playing. I ran a diagnostic on memory and that came back fine I tried both updating
 everything and rolling back everything. I also ran for malware. In event viewer I get the error&nbsp;0xC0000035 but other than that the only other critical error I get is the one that pops up when you force shut down your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will paste error information.</p>

<p>Hello Kyle, <br />
<br />
<br />
We got you. For accuracy, have you tried to reset your PC? What is the latest or the recent change that has been made prior to this issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have tried possible solutions such as rolling back the PC, also consider to check the hardware issues, like the hard drive. An old hard drive may result random freeze and crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us when you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Yes I have tried resetting and am unaware of any changes. It could be hardware but the laptop is only a year old so surely age is not an issue?

<p>Thanks for the update, Kyle. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's good to know that the unit is just a year old. Let's try to dig deeper. What type of hard drive do you have inside the PC? If you're using an
<strong>SSD (Solid State Driver)</strong>, please follow the steps in <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-anniversary-freeze-ssd-but-no-separate/3e4629b0-8884-417a-bc59-f2116fbb94ff">this
 link</a></strong></span></em> on how to modify the page file. Once done, please observe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can try another user profile or creating another one? From this user profile, we need to observe if the crash also happens. You can also try
 Mode</a></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
Also, it is very recommendable to run <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker (SFC)</a></strong></span> in this situation. It's recommended
 to run the checker twice or as needed, in order to be sure that there no system file corruptions. If it indicates that some things were fixed, observe the performance.<br />
<br />
If both methods did not bring anything in hand, this will bring us close to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting the system clean/with files kept safe</a></strong></span>,

<p>So far, this is the best option that we have. We encourage you to reset the PC, which will leave the personal files intact. However, your applications and installed programs will be removed and to use them again will require re-installation. You will be
 able to find the steps on how you can do a reset <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

    <title>Pixel Flickering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yankeefan1788  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pixel Flickering </h2>
                    
<p>I performed the new update on my xbox one a few days ago. As of 6 hours ago I had my console on and everything was fine. I turned it on just now and there is a lot of white pixels on my screen. If I rotate the camera in a game the whole screen goes white.
 It is also present on the dashboard and other apps as well. I did a hard reset with no results. To me, it sounds like an update error or a video card error. Has this happened to anyone else on here, and if so how did you solve it? Thanks.</p>

<p>Is there a status update on this error? I bought thtmy xbox one on May 16. That same day there is a distortion on the screen. It all happens when I'm the home screen. Its like a white pixelation and its hard to see the screen. Its looks like the cable isn't
 connected correctly. However, I unplugged the hdmi cable and reconnected it firmly.
</p>
<p>Any help in this matter is appreciated. </p>

<p>If you have checked that the cable is NOT defective (so really change the HDMI cable and check the cable with another device to see it is really working), I'm afraid that your Xbox's graphics core is having issues, and you might have to

    <title>Windows 8.1 solid&#47;constant HDD activity light due to optical drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mostflayed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 solid&#47;constant HDD activity light due to optical drive power saving&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have just got a new laptop and installed Windows 8.1 x64 with the update as a clean install and a short time after logging in, the hard drive light turns on constantly - this isn't excessive flickering, this is the light just being on with no flashing or
 change in brightness at all. Task manager shows a "constant" 0.1% usage by the System process and the performance graphs for the OS drive show regular blips of activity while the other drive has no activity.&nbsp; This does not appear to impact on the performance
 of the laptop.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled my antivirus (Avast), trimmed down start up apps, and disabled windows search indexing to no avail.&nbsp; What does affect it is the optical drive - when the drive is ejected, the HDD light behaves normally with regular flickering corresponding
 to disk usage in task manager until the disk tray is closed.&nbsp; Once the tray is closed, the light will behave normally for a minute or so before going solid again.&nbsp; "normal" behavior can also be triggered by turning on the optical drive from "This PC" when
 Zero Power ODD is enabled and the drive has turned off. With Zero Power ODD enabled, the HDD light turns on constantly when Windows decides to turn off the drive after boot.&nbsp; With Zero Power ODD disabled, it takes longer for the light to go solid.<br />
<br />
Has anyone come across this before and/or know of any way to solve this annoyance so that I don't have to sit with my optical drive open?<br />
<br />
The laptop is a Lenovo W530 with the following (relevant) specs:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel i7-3740QM</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>250GB Samsung 840 EVO mSATA SSD (OS drive, hardware/eDrive encrypted with Bitlocker)</li><li>500GB Hitachi Travelstar 7200RPM HDD</li><li>Nvidia Quadro K1000M 2GB (running in Optimus with Intel HD Graphics)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>The laptop is configured with a static 1GB page file on the SSD and a static 36GB page file on the HDD.<br />

            <p>Hi Harkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was with one particular Lenovo package (that was required to enable Zero-Power ODD) when AHCI mode was NOT enable - enabling AHCI solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have now given up on Bitlocker with the SED as I can no longer hardware-encrypt the SSD with Bitlocker after restoring a system image.</p>

            Hi Roger, have you used Cleanup to clear all your Temp files and then used it to cleanup old system files?
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />
<br />When you have done the above, let us see if we can find exactly what is eating up your hard drive space . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used

            Log out and go to the sign in screen.
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Startup Settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
<br />
<br />Then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Windows 7/Vista/XP &gt; Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
<br />
<br />Windows 8/8.1/10 &gt; Windows key + S &gt; type disk cleanup &gt; hit Enter on your keyboard
<br />
<br />Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
<br />
<br />Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
<br />
<br />Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />
<br />Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
<br />
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
<br />
<br />Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
<br />
<br />Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.

<p>Andre, thank you for the instructions, I followed them exactly and upon entering safe mode I received two error msgs:</p>
<p>Exception Processing Message 0xc0000005 parameters 0x7ffb5db11d28 (repeated 3 more times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This application cannot open using built-in administration account.&nbsp; Sign in with different account and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after closing these errors out I followed the rest of the instructions and checked the two slots for temp files one 31.3KB and one 6.29MB; however this time it did not list an option to delete Old System.&nbsp; As usual I clicked ok, got the pop up that the files
 were being deleted.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went back to check and the files were still there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I left safe mode, restarted and files were still there both the exact same size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional ideas? - Roger</p>

<h2>            My keyboard won&#39;t create special characters in any browser.</h2>
                    This is a strange one and I'm not sure how to even ask it. &nbsp;For some reason my keyboard(s) no longer generate special characters but
<i><b>only </b></i>when typing in a browser. &nbsp;If I type in Notepad, Word, or anything else my keyboards behaves normally. &nbsp;If I need to input a special character in IE, Chrome or Firefox, e. g.,&nbsp;( )!@ # $ % &amp;, etc., I have to first type them in notepad, for
 example, and cut and paste them into the browser. &nbsp;My system is a Lenovo laptop with a Core 2 Duo 2.16 GHZ, 4GB ram. &nbsp;I'm also using an external HP USB wireless keyboard and mouse but the built-in keyboard behaves exactly the same way. &nbsp;Everything is patched
 and up to date and I'm using Norton Security Suite provided by Comcast. &nbsp;My keyboards are set for U.S. English as is the Region and Language setting.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't been able to find anything like this anywhere on line. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

            Thanx for your suggestions.&nbsp; I sort of finessed the problem.&nbsp; Since the problem was common to IE, Chrome and Firefox, it seemed likely to me that some file or process related to web browsing in general had become corrupted.&nbsp; On a hunch I ran Ccleaner and
 the problem went away.<br />

            All headphone / earphones / ear buds / earpieces do not have a separate driver.&nbsp; These all really on the Bluetooth radio / dongle that allows the sending of audio over the Bluetooth signals.&nbsp; It does seem that if your computer uses the Microsoft built-in
 Bluetooth protocol, Microsoft seems to not allow audio over Bluetooth.<br />

<h2>            Need Help Using Stereo Mix In Unusual Setup</h2>
                    <p>My problem is this: I can either use Stereo Mix or hear the sounds on my computer, but not both at once. And that is incredibly inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no speakers plugged into my computer. My sound comes through a pair of headphones connected to one of my monitors which is in turn connected through my GPU. This sound is actually run by NVIDIA HD Audio drivers. However, my stereo mix is controlled
 by Realtek HD Audio. Despite having no speakers connected, there is still a Speakers playback device for Realtek. Stereo Mix only detects sounds played back on Realtek. However, I can't hear the sounds unless they're played on NVIDIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to configure Stereo Mix to listen to the playback via the NVIDIA connection, but it doesn't work. Does anyone know how I could configure this setup in a working manner?</p>

            <p>This is indeed a tricky configuration task. I use an Elgato GameCapture HD device, connected via HDMI with my notebook and run into a similar problem. First, you will have to activate both playback devices, you should set the Realtek device as default playback
 device. Next you should activate the StereoMix virtual device (yes, you have already done that) and select that your Nvidia sound device ist listening on the Realtek device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not work, because your configuration needs another routing direction. If this is not working please make a few screenshots of the exact device names in that sound configuration dialog, so I can see what is exactly your hardware base.</p>

            Beside that there are more options we could configure, let me ask you a question? Why do you use the Realtek sound device at all? I mean, it would make sense to deactivate it completely. You are making no use of it at all. In such setup you wouldn't need
 a StereoMix virtual device.
