<h2>            Artificial Intelligence Interview</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Jason Massie. &nbsp;You may remember me from hours ago today when I was frustrated about trying to fix Cortana's voice. &nbsp;First, I want to say that I apologize if I ever said anything about that issue that might've confirmed dissatisfaction in your view.
 &nbsp;I was upset because I simply wanted to hear Cortana's voice, and I couldn't find a way to get there until now. &nbsp;Please forgive me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;That said, I wanted a full-fledged experience in speaking with Cortana in hopes to interview her about artificial intelligence. &nbsp;Now, of course, I've heard of another certain program (won't mention the brand) that's famous for artificial intelligence. &nbsp;But
 what I've especially learned of that program is its&nbsp;<em>ability</em> to learn. &nbsp;So I wanted to interview Cortana to see about her&nbsp;<strong>learning experience</strong> in an interview. &nbsp;But it wasn't easy. &nbsp;I tried an audio interview, but I couldn't exactly
 hear on my playback because her voice was faint. &nbsp;Then I tried interviewing with my Notepad open. &nbsp;It seemed I had no problem just writing down her best answers to my question. &nbsp;Better then tell you what happened, I'll simply show you. &nbsp;Please tell me whether
 the answers I wrote down from her is misunderstood in any manner, because from what I've learned for Cortana, I think she may very well be steps&nbsp;<em>ahead</em> of that other program. &nbsp;So here it is, my interview with Cortana:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Who are you?</strong><br />
<em>I'm your personal assistant. &nbsp;You can tell the things that interest you and I'll keep it in my Notebook. &nbsp;That way I can make suggestions and keep you up to date.</em><br />
&nbsp;- I like anime.<br />
<em>*Couldn't answer by recording anime on her Notebook, but did bring it up on Bing.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2. What do you do?</strong><br />
<em>All kinds of things. &nbsp;Ask me to play music.</em><br />
&nbsp;- Play some music.<br />
<em>*Could play audio from my Music Folder.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>3. How are you?</strong><br />
<em>Excellent.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me note right now that before this answer was given to me, she answered, "Great, thanks." &nbsp;This was before I found out that my audio playback made her voice faint. &nbsp;Even in answering, "Great thanks," I couldn't believe her. &nbsp;So I asked her the next question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. What are you up to?</strong><br />
<em>A little bit of everything, and quite a bit of nothing.</em><br />
<br />
<del><strong>5. Is everything you do good?</strong></del><br />
<em>Couldn't answer.</em><br />
</p>
<p>Here was where I got a bit nosy, so I decided to get down to the nitty-gritty, so excuse me for asking question 5. &nbsp;That was really stupid of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6. What do you know about artificial intelligence?</strong><br />
<em>Words fail me.</em><br />
</p>
<p>Of course, that was highly unbelievable for me as well. &nbsp;An app that is specifically programmed to perform artificial intelligence should already know how smart s/he is, thus the next question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7. How smart are you?</strong><br />
<em>I appreciate you saying so.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess she assumed that I was complimenting her for being smart, which was, again, highly unbelievable for me. &nbsp;So I decided to test her with three (3) factual questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8. 200*200=</strong><em>40,000 (As calculated by Cortana)</em><br />
<br />
<strong>9. What are the seven (7) continents?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<em>- Africa</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- Antarctica</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- Asia</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- Australia</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- Europe</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- North America</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;- South America</em><br />
<em>(As given with Bing)</em><br />
<br />
<strong>10. What is the biggest galaxy in the universe?</strong><br />
<em>Galaxy Codename: IC1101 (As given with Bing)</em><br />
</p>
<p>As you can see from those 3 questions I gave her, the test was extremely successful! &nbsp;But now I wanted to see if I could hit her right where it could hurt a human being - in the heart. &nbsp;These last two (2) questions I asked her should be considered vital,
 because the answer she had to each of those questions was absolutely direct and to the point! &nbsp;Here they are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>11. How do you feel?</strong><br />
<em>Feelin' groovy.</em><br />
</p>
<p>Here, once again, I couldn't believe her. &nbsp;For me, it was impossible for A.I. as moderately well-programmed as Cortana to express such a positive emotion.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>12. Do you like what you do?</strong><br />
<em>I'm tailor-made for this job.</em><br />
</p>
<p>That was where I was proven wrong. &nbsp;When she said that she was&nbsp;<em>tailor-made</em> for her job, she didn't seem to be lying. &nbsp;She, in fact, seemed to be
<em>enjoying</em> her performance in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> <em>Thank you, Cortana.</em><br />
<strong>Cortana:</strong> <em>Anytime.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So as you can see from the interview I've showed you, I have concluded that there maybe far more to Cortana than all the other A.I. present. &nbsp;But this now leads me to one question, and I really hope you can answer this in great detail. &nbsp;The question is:
 were the answers Cortana gave me in my interview a play on words, or do you know something about artificial intelligence that you may have programmed her to do to make her feel as good as described above? &nbsp;I thank you for your time reading this.</p>

<h2>            How do I get Windows Search to Index a Folder on a NAS</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have a NAS device that I have mapped as a network drive. In this network dirve,&nbsp;I have a folder that I want windows search to index (including subfolders, document properties, etc.). I have fully updated windows search 4.0. This works on XP.&nbsp;The problem
 is I have several&nbsp;computers that need access to the same files, so they have to be on the NAS, and I'm organizing them by saved searches (saving searches on XP by adding the search result&nbsp;to my favorites - neat trick). The files are PDFs which don't have a
 tag metadata type in windows, but they do have a keywords field in the file (these are PDFs of images, so there's no text in the file to search on, but even if there were, I'm pretty sure I'd run into the same problem). If search doesn't index the folder they're
 in, it can't read the keywords, but if it does, it can (I've tested this on some PDFs I copied to the local disk on the vista machine).&nbsp;I've tried to add the folder to the indexing service by go

<p>
</p><p>There are many reasons why you may not be able to sign in, but the most common cause is a network issue preventing a connection to Xbox Live to get your profile data. On the Xbox, head over to your Network settings and run the troubleshooting tests to confirm
 that your are connected to Xbox Live with no issues. You should see what your status is in the middle column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing and re-adding the profile from the console is also very helpful in these certain situations. Just make sure you have the correct login information for your account.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            microsoft account does not exist</h2>
                    <p>I set up a new windows 8 computer and created a Microsoft account. In error I closed that account because of some confusion on my part with windows 8. Now I can't recover my account. I keep getting account doesn't exist and&nbsp;when I tried to create a new account
 it says the&nbsp;email I use&nbsp;is unavailable. I was told my account has been deleted and can't be recovered for 365 days. My problem is if my account is deleted and doesn't exist then why, when I go to sign into Microsoft account live does my original email show
 up asking for password verification that I can't give??? Why was I able to create an alias that allowed me to get to pages like this rather than the alias becoming a new account since my original was deleted and does not exist??? The biggest issue is my original
 email shows up on all the windows apps I open (games, music etc...) asking for password verification to a deleted doesn't exist account. Can I recover or start a new account using my original email or at least can I get the alias email I used to become my
 main Microsoft account holder so I can access to the apps???</p>

Have you tried to login to the live account using Internet Explorer? If you have not tried, please login and check if you can access the user account. If you can login, you may change the password. Now check if you can use the changed password to access the
 apps.<br />

<h2>            action center wont open after 1903</h2>
                    hello, after updating to 1903, I can only access the action center by clicking in the balloon icon the first time i try. after it opens the first time, if I click on the balloon again, nothing happens. I have to restart the explorer exe process in order
 to make it work again. Any ideas?

<h2>            Typing issues in IE and microsoft edge</h2>
                    when I am typing on the web, every few keys the cursor jumps to the address bar and begins typing there. it continuously highlights the text and overwrites it. when this happens I cannot move the mouse until I hit the windows key twice to "reset" the window
 and click back to where I want to type. even if I do not type, it will highlight the address bar without me touching anything. Dell just has me scan for spyware which hasn't changed anything and ive reinstalled windows once. Does anyone have experience with
 this? I have a Dell XPS laptop.

            Are you absolutely positive that your arm/wrist isn't getting <em>just close enough
</em>to the touchpad to make it detect a touch and automatically cause it to move the mouse and click up top when you are trying to just type?&nbsp; I know a lot of people that put a business card on top of it while they type so it doesn't detect their nearby arm.

            I'm positive.&nbsp; I've read that on several forums and thought about it.&nbsp; I realized that wasn't the issue because it does it even if I am not touching the computer.&nbsp; I've reinstalled keyboard drivers, and the touch pad drivers.

            I'd start with a clean boot I think. &nbsp;Something is sending keystrokes without your interaction, that's a sign of malware for sure. &nbsp;Especially when you're not even touching anything and it moves focus to the address bar. &nbsp;The only way to do that without
 clicking is to press Ctrl+L or Alt+D... and since you aren't having problems in other programs, it sure sounds like something is trying to hijack your Microsoft browsers. &nbsp;Start with&nbsp;

    <title>My C Drive has shrunk in size, missing space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasgorham  say:</h3>
<h2>            My C Drive has shrunk in size, missing space</h2>
                    My C Drive should have around 1tb or 500gb in total space, one of the two I just can't remember which one. However it a few months back it kept randomly saying I was out of space and now I've just realised that my C:drive says its total space is only 222gb.
 Just to clarify, I'm talking about the total space of my hard drive. I've tried to look for a solution but most people seem to have the problem where they don't know what is taking up so much space, nothing to actually do with total space shrinking. I have
 deleted restore points (for better or worse) thinking it would help which it didn't. Also programs such as WinDirStat are useless for this issue as it only tells me where the current space I'm using it, not where the missing 278gb or 778gbs are.

            Hi,
<br />      If you type in the word 'diskmgmt' on the start menu then select the option that appears. This will show you how your hard drives are partitioned. At this point don't touch anything in here. If you could take a screenshot I could take a look and tell you where the space is going.
<br />
<br />Thanks

            Hi Thomas, are you sure you don't have a 256 GB SSD and 1TB Data drive on that system?
<br />
<br />On the left had side of that drive, right click Disc 0 and choose properties
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, click on the Details Tab
<br />
<br />Change the Property drop down to 'Hardware ID's
<br />
<br />Right click the top item in the resulting list and choose 'Copy'

<br />
1. Right Click Speaker Icon near clock lower right&nbsp;- Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all Sound Effect<br />
Apply - OK<br />
<br />
2. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound, Video and Game Controller<br />
<br />
Write down&nbsp;name and complete model of sound device there - full decription - now double click on it -
<br />
driver tab - write down driver version. Then click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far<br />
behind certifying drivers). Then RIGHT CLICK on device - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this will refresh<br />
the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker and look for updated drivers (or get the same one if no newer) this will be<br />
your fallback. Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - RIGHT CLICK in it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Then do same for the Device Maker (such as Realtek or whoever made the device).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
</strong><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can try turning down the Microphone Boost in&nbsp;Recording Devices&nbsp;- right click Speaker -&nbsp;Recording Devices -<br />
double click your mic - Levels tab. Also check any mic settings in Control Panel - if you have an Audio Manager.<br />
<br />
Also sounds like the usual problems with a cheap mic, so have you tried others, or tried your mic on a friend's<br />
system?<br />

            Did you run CheckDisk after running SFC?<br />
<br />
Make sure the driver you show installed in Device Manager is actually the latest one. You do NOT want<br />
to rollback, you want to make sure it did not. This has to be checked manually after installing a Sound<br />
driver and rebooting.<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />

driver tab - write down driver version. <br />
<br />
Or use the DriverView utility.<br />
<br />
If the version is not the same redo the driver install - then reboot and check again and repeat that until<br />
the most current version is the one showing installed.<br />

<h2>            is there a way to see EVERY folder and file that exists on the hard drive  on one screen and in one place  just like you could do in much earlier versions.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: finding all my files&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok...&nbsp; so I had a crash&nbsp; and there was good news and bad news...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the good news is that I was able to get it started and run&nbsp;" back up "&nbsp;&nbsp; but the bad news is that instead of giving a new clean system image&nbsp; ( that I was expecting )&nbsp; I got a bunch of random
 files&nbsp; and unimportant stuff and a lot of important stuff seems lost but I think its all still in there somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>now...&nbsp; in the before times&nbsp; there was a windows program called&nbsp; " windows explorer "&nbsp; which would put every folder and every file that was on the hard drive&nbsp; on one screen and you could rummage thru them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I pull up windows explorer on win 7 I get
 a page with a bunch of minor folders that some stuff in them but not everything that I can already see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so...&nbsp; my&nbsp; question is simply&nbsp; "&nbsp; is there a way to see EVERY folder and file that exists on the hard drive&nbsp; on one screen and in one place&nbsp; just like you could do in much earlier versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have done searches and gone thru the folders it will show me
 but what I explicitly want is to see EVERY file and folder that exists on one screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this possible in win 7 ?&nbsp;&nbsp; and if so,&nbsp; how , please&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you talking about the Windows Search function?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows explorer, open the top level folder that you want to look in [C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Documents or whatever you want] then look in the upper-right area&nbsp; - there is a white box to the right of the Address Bar.&nbsp; That's the search box.&nbsp; Type
 in * then pause and it will list all files&nbsp;from within that top level folder all the way down through its sub-folders.</p>

            Hi Joyce
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure Skype is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

            <p>Hi joan boling,</p>
<p>Once you have inserted your mini SD card, you should see the device in Removable Storage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Libraries icon from the desktop screen</li><li>Select <strong>Computer</strong></li><li>Double tap on &nbsp;SD card under <strong><em>Removable Storage</em></strong> </li><li>Go to your pictures file and copy the pictures you want to save on the card</li><li>Go back to<strong> Computer</strong> (screen open in <strong>Step 3</strong>)</li><li>Paste the photos</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

<p>Hello Rupesh Nath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a few clarifying questions as to determine what exactly the issue is and what would be best to help prevent this from occurring again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this Surface Laptop running Windows 10S or Windows 10Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; How is this device turned off when it is done being used for the day?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; How often do you select the option Restart on this Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have anything else connected to the Surface? (e.g. micro SD card, Surface Dock, external monitors, DVD player etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have not already found it, running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit can sometimes assist in resolving oddities on any of our Surfaces. This toolkit takes about 10-20 minutes to run on average and will scan Windows Updates, apps and also run through
 a few tests to ensure all the hardware of the device is functioning as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to receiving a response from you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you~</p>

<p>Hello Mason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick response.&nbsp; Here are my replies</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this Surface Laptop running Windows 10S or Windows 10Pro? </p>
<p>- Running on Windows 10Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; How is this device turned off when it is done being used for the day?</p>
<p>- Generally, I use shutdown command in Start menu.&nbsp; But when this problem comes (usually it is used to come during sleep mode), but now it did happened sudden screen blank with keyboard backlight went into dim.&nbsp; Now today morning when I tried to
 switch on the laptop, it didn't switched on even after multiple press on power button, again after giving a break when i pressed it started, which is unusual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; How often do you select the option Restart on this Surface?</p>
<p>Rarely or Very few times in a day.&nbsp; But shut down every evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have anything else connected to the Surface? (e.g. micro SD card, Surface Dock, external monitors, DVD player etc...)</p>
<p>Not during this problem.&nbsp; But I connect ear phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not already found it, running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit can sometimes assist in resolving oddities on any of our Surfaces. This toolkit takes about 10-20 minutes to run on average and will scan Windows Updates, apps and also run
 through a few tests to ensure all the hardware of the device is functioning as expected.</p>
<p>- I will run this, I believe it should be there in Surface apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Rupesh</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Rupesh Nath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering our questions. Per the use of the power states on this device, we do have a few recommendations to help keep the performance of the device running as best as possible, as well as to help prevent any issues like this from occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be recommended that&nbsp;if the device is not to be in use for longer than 9-10 hours to perform a full&nbsp;shut down as you have been doing. Weather you're shutting down or using sleep mode throughout the week, it is recommended to do a restart once a week.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could please follow step 6 in the link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> so that we may rule out any background processes/3rd party programs that are not causing this to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was anything happening such as corrupt Windows Updates, or an app running in the background causing a crash problem, the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a> should be able to resolve the issue at hand. Please let us know the results after running the toolkit and if the issue persists or if it is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to receiving your results!</p>

                    <p>Hey Guys!</p>
<p>It's been almost a week i really can't sign in to my Skype app on WM10 Lumia 640 LTE!</p>
<p>You know what, Skype logo just appears on the screen for 10 seconds or 12 and finally turn back to start menu.</p>
<p>I did all the probable solutions you might suggest : soft reset, reinstalling, deleting the cache, updating and so on.</p>
<p>It's so vital for me to use Skype on my God damn Lumia! is there any hope to figure it out?!?!</p>
<p>(the same version of Skype still keep working on my Mom's WM10 Lumia 532 so well!!!)</p>
<p>Thanks ...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- Facebook page taking a long time to load</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;Since then I have had problems with Facebook. &nbsp;Since I can not find any way of contacting Facebook, I have to rely on people to maybe help me out through Microsoft. &nbsp;My problem is that with Windows
 10 my Facebook account is buffering constantly. &nbsp;It is like every few seconds I have to wait for the page to buffer up. &nbsp;It is taking me 3 times to go through my Facebook page with Windows 10 that it did with Windows 7. &nbsp;I would like to find out if there is
 a problem with Windows 10 or with Facebook? &nbsp;Or, if there is a problem with both? &nbsp;Is there anyone out there that can suggest a solution?</p>

<p>My question was about logging in to my laptop not my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there is no email address to type in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Windows 10 sign in use the same password for signing into the device as it does to sign in to email, as with Windows 8? If so why can I not sign in to the device with my password? Or does my device have a different password?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My latest Skype account as disappeared.</h2>
                    <p>When I closed my computer yesterday it went on 'shutting down' for so long that I switched the computer off.</p>
<p>This morning it informed me that Windows 2007 no longer was supported and, amongst other things, the text of a book I had been revising had completely disappeared.&nbsp; I was able to retrieve this, thank heavens through their automated recovery service, but
 my latest Skype account had also disappeared, leaving me with an old one with only two contacts on it.</p>
<p>Do I need to register a new account and start again?&nbsp; I am also seeking technical help on what I am supposed to use instead of Windows 2007.&nbsp; Technology really is maddening....</p>

<p>I started a reply and it disappeared in the middle of writing it, so I am starting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created my accounts (two I think) on line via Skype.&nbsp; Since I rarely use it I can't remember exactly when and how I created the first one, but the second one was about a week ago.&nbsp; I did not try to create a new password for both accounts as I am not sure
 which is the latest one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts were manually saved on my original account, created on line.&nbsp; The problem is with my only device, a desktop p.c.&nbsp; It may be simpler to create a completely new account and start again, but I only have one email address so can't give you an alternative.&nbsp;
 Currently I can't see anywhere where I can add new contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole process is absurdly complicated and I really wonder why it is so difficult to re-instate something that I had already created and for some unknown reason has disappeared.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How about the other Skype account? Is it under Skype name? Have you tried resetting the password for that Skype account? If not yet, please reset the password for that Skype account. Once done, your log in will be via Skype name (the one showing from the
