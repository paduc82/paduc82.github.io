<h2>            I get &#34;Printer is in error state&#34; when printing a test page on a redirected printer.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried these RDP clients:</p>
<p>Windows XP (sp3)</p>
<p>Windows 7 (With 8.1 RDP client)</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Windows 2012R2</p>
<p>
</p><p>My RDP server is Windows 2012 R2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My configuration:</p>
<p>1 Ricoh 312DN printer is locally installed on each RDP clients: the port is a standard TCP/IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the RDP server, the policies are set as follow:</p>
<p><strong>Do not allow client printer redirection - Disabled</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use Terminal Services Easy Print printer driver first - Enabled</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to disable Easy printer feature but the Ricoh is not created on the RDP server. The Ricoh driver has been preloaded using Print Management console on the RDP Server and is the exact same version than on the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this configuration, I am able to print a test page locally on the client RDP. The printer is created on the RDP server with "(redirected 2)" note. The port is TS001 WS0001:PRN7:#2 Printer: Ricoh...</p>
<p>WS0001 is the name of my station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything sound good until I right click on the printer (Devices and Printers on Windows 2012 R2), select "Printer properties and then select "Print Test Page".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately receive a message "Printer is in error state", the test page stay stuck in the spool with the status "Error - Printing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best, I can cancel the document so the spool can communicate with the printer. Additionally, when the printer need a maintenance to change a cartridge, the redirected printer get the status and warns to change the cartridge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea will be welcome,</p>
<p>thanks by advance</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should always write down any password and keep it in a secure location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can recommend is to contact HP Support and see if there are any options to&nbsp;use the Simple Pass component in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can also check on the HP Support Forums for other users that may have solved this problem.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows Server 2012 Bandwith Limit Updates. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mzsystemsupport  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Server 2012 Bandwith Limit Updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have Microsoft Server 2012 R2 installed and are using it for WSUS and Active Directory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had the group policy setup to "Limit the Network Bandwidth used by BITS" during our business hours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>this method worked fine for Windows 7 and the couple 8 machines we had but now that we have upgraded to Windows 10, the latest and greatest of the Microsoft Operating System we are finding that our little 10MB pipe is too small to get windows updates shoved
 down with no regard to our operation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To counter act windows updates using the entire bandwidth of the company i have rate limited the ports across our smart switch. This fixed the issue of internet going out for the whole building while someone was downloading updates but now the person downloading
 the update gets barely any use from their station as the receive pipe is maxed out so they cant get anything but the windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To counter act this I have rate limited our WSUS server to lower than the clients. This has fixed the issues the clients were experiencing but now when i remote to the WSUS server the connection is incredibly slow and drops out due to the overloaded pipe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So considering the Group policy object obviously does not work any more. How do you suggest I limit the amount of bandwidth WSUS uses across my LAN?<br />
Preferably this would be a Per-Client limit (i.e. "Limit Network Bandwidth Used to Transfer Updates to Client") Then i could say use 2MB of the pipe during business hours and life would be wonderful, all my clients get the updates simultaneously trickled to
 their machine over the course of the day and any that did not receive the whole thing by the end of the day can then use the whole pipe to make the transfer.
</p>
<p>Less Preferable but still Usable would be a "Limit the Network Bandwidth Used by Windows Update". this would limit the bandwidth as a whole (Don't use more than X bandwidth to deliver updates). This is less desirable as the most likely thing that happens
 in this situation is one or two clients start to receive updates, the transfer limit is reached, delivery to new clients is paused until the first clients have the update files. But then at the end of the day the pipe opens and all still get the updates by
 the next day. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in this issue would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thoughts, Ramblings and Notes for Microsoft Corporate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be a very simple thing for an International Multi-Billion Mega Enterprise to accomplish.</p>
<p>I understand updates are important, <strong>but not more important than doing business.</strong> I am very disappointed that these settings were not tested and verified as working before the Windows 10 update was shipped out. Features that worked fine in
 7 &amp; 8 are now broken or possibly even just forgotten, and not small things, we are talking features used to manage businesses. Entire companies rely on your products working as described and when that is not the case, problems arise costing the business relying
 on these features to lose money either by a slow down in work flow or in some cases a complete and total stop in the operation of the business. Everything runs on a network in today's business, Phones, Printers, Scanners, Computers and even Watches, When your
 product decides that and update is needed all of those devices cease to work as the user expects, they slow down or they stop all together wait for a response from a slow slow pipe. It just feels like Microsoft is no longer trying to accommodate Small or even
 Medium Businesses any more. All products are focused toward Enterprise use and Fortune 500 Companies. We in the small business sector do not have the physical infrastructure to support this grand plan of a wholly connected and unified windows experience. We
 have limited bandwidth, limited resources, and limited processing power and I feel Microsoft has failed to understand that in the latest iterations of their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just the thoughts of one lowly IT person that has to deal with these products 10 hours a day 5 days a week(Minimum).</p>
<p>If you find this type of feedback useful and would like more just have a "Social Media Representative" go through the "Spiceworks Community"&nbsp; there are literally 1000's of IT Professionals on there on a daily basis providing feedback on your operating systems.
 Lots of really good feedback that if listened to, digested and implemented properly would bring "Microsoft Windows" back to being the pinnacle of Operating System Software, rather than being a dis-liked but necessary evil, kept around simply because there
 is no better option.</p>

<h2>            why is office word not working</h2>
                    I bought my laptop a few months back and have only really used word occasionally. It is now asking for a product code when i try to use it. As far as i know it is not a trial version, and if it is i feel cheated as it does not let you know that when you
 buy it. Any help would be much appreciated as i really do not want to spend more money on another program. Thanks in advance for any help. x

            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as i know it is not a trial version.<br />
In that case, you have to remember that you bought the Microsoft office programs <strong>
separately</strong>.<br />
If you did, then you should have a disk that came with the purchase of the MS Office programs. The disk or the box has the product key that you need.<br />
<br />
If the MS Office came with the computer, then it is a trial version.Trial version is a free download, good for only 60 days.&nbsp;You are not being cheated, because you&nbsp;never pay for it.<br />
you can easily find out whether it is a trial version......<br />
Open MS Word &gt; look at the top, the word " Trial " should be prominently displayed.<br />
<br />
If you have no desire to purchase a full version, here is the tutorial to uninstall. The tutorial has instructions for 2003, 2007 and&nbsp;2010 versions. Make sure you use the coorect one.<br />

<h2>            windows vista guest account user type</h2>
                    I changed the guest account into an administrator, but can not change it back to the standard. I go thru the motons, but it gives no error messages &amp; remains an administrator.

            The Guest account you find in Control Panel&gt;User Accounts should not be used at all (see below for why). Are you logged into an administrative account when you try to make the change? If yes, then try a System Restore. If that doesn't work, disable the
 Guest account.<br />
<br />
Do not use the Guest account you see in the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. The Guest account is a special system account, not one meant for when you are feeling hospitable. It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Linux, Unix, and OS X for a
 reason.<br />
<br />
From TechNet:<br />
<br />
"The Guest account is intended for users who require temporary access to the system. However, if this account is enabled, a security risk may exist because an unauthorized user could gain anonymous access to the system through this account."<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx<br />
<br />
So if you enabled Guest, disable it now and create a Standard/Limited (Vista, XP Pro/XP Home) for your visitors. Call the new user account something like "Visitor".<br />
<br />
Further information about user accounts in Vista:<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />

<h2>            XP Professional corrupt windows&#47;system32&#47;l_intl.nls - NO CD&#39;s</h2>
                    I'm in a real jam. I use my home office computer to work every day and today i got the blackscreen corrupted or missing file message for file /windows/system32/l_intl_nls<br />
<br />
I run the XP professional edition on my Dell Vostro 410. I have no backup or reboot CD....no XP cd...nothing! Is there anyway for me to find and burn a good version of this file extension, then upload it to my computer? Im not very computer savvy so I need
 it detailed instructions to help me get it in and uploaded.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! Ericka<br />
<br />
oh, and as for the error....my computer is about 4 years old...I usually leave my computer running 24/7 but we left town for a few days so I shut it down normally. When i returned and turned it on...i got the error message.

            <p>burn a hiren's boot cd and then run checkdisk with the /r parameter, you may need to run 2 or 3 times, until no errors are found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Courtesy of Jose Ibarra</font></font></span></p>
<p><b><u><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
</font></span></u></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font>The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.imgburn.com/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</font></a><br />
<br />
<font><font>It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp;
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction
 to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>You may have to run the chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;

    <title>No Wifi Option in Settings and Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyqa  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Wifi Option in Settings and Taskbar</h2>
                    My windows 10 laptop cannot connect to the internet because there is no wireless internet option in the settings or the task bar. Normally where the WiFi logo is, there is an Ethernet logo instead. I can't even use the Ethernet because my laptop DOESN'T
 EVEN HAVE AN ETHERNET PORT. I check my device manager in my network adapters and there is no WLAN or wireless internet drivers. There is only WAN drivers which have no effect on my device (I even uninstalled them and had no effect). I've tried resetting the
 laptop multiple times to no effect. My laptop is an iRulu SpiritBook S1. I have tried going on its website to download drivers, but there are none. My laptop's WiFi has worked perfectly up until now. Now I go on Task Manager and there is only 3 things, CPU,
 Memory, and Disk. It doesn't seem like the laptop has any internet capabilities even though it was working perfectly. Please Help!

            Hi andyQA
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network Adapter &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

</p><blockquote>My windows 10 laptop cannot connect to the internet because there is no wireless internet option in the settings or the task bar. Normally where the WiFi logo is, there is an Ethernet logo instead. I can't
 even use the Ethernet because my laptop DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN ETHERNET PORT. I check my device manager in my network adapters and there is no WLAN or wireless internet drivers. There is only WAN drivers which have no effect on my device (I even uninstalled
 them and had no effect). I've tried resetting the laptop multiple times to no effect. My laptop is an iRulu SpiritBook S1. I have tried going on its website to download drivers, but there are none. My laptop's WiFi has worked perfectly up until now. Now I
 go on Task Manager and there is only 3 things, CPU, Memory, and Disk. It doesn't seem like the laptop has any internet capabilities even though it was working perfectly. Please Help!

            <span>Hi andyQA,</span><br />
<span>first try if you solve this: Go to Device Manager, right-click on the network adapters node&gt; Scan for hardware changes.</span><br />
<span>If you do not resolve, contact your PC's Technical Support, they are able to tell you what is the model of the network adapter installed on your PC and which appropriate driver to download and install.</span><span>
</span><span>Otherwise, buy an external USB wi-fi dongle.</span>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Constant Random Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jchc_927  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Constant Random Freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally use Windows 7, trying to update that to Windows 10 but it does not allow me to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I purchase a new SSD (Crucial BX300 480gb) to install Win 10 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it constantly freezes for no particular reason. Sometimes it freezes when it starts up. Sometimes it freezes when I start searching something. Sometimes it freezes when it is loading into Windows.</p>
<p>So in fact it also freezes when I am now re-installing the Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it is the problem of the new SSD, but then I clone my old Win7 drive there. It works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated the BIOS and drivers and stuff, it just freezes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I thought maybe it is the problem of Win 10 1803, then I install 1703 instead. Still it freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the memory test, they work alright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is my hardware,</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU: Intel i7 4790</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte H97-D3H</p>
<p>Display: Asus GTX750ti</p>
<p>Ram: 2 x 8gb Crucial 240-pin DIMM</p>
<p>SSD: Crucial BX300 48gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just think maybe some of my hardware crashes with Win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.<br />
</p>

            yes I buy both of them, but since I install the Win 10 on the completely new SSD, I think the Win 7 does not really matter in this case.

<h2>            Windows Media Player ducking is pausing instead of lowering volume</h2>
                    I have ducking turned on in my Sound-&gt;Communications, but instead of the volume ducking by 50% or 80%, it is pausing... This is annoying in VOIP were people can be speaking all the time.

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
1. Does the issue occur when you play files from the CD/DVD or from the Hard disk or both?<br />
2. Do you remember any changes to your machine prior to the issue occurring?</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below to fix the issue:<br />
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong> Run the Windows Media Player Settings and Library troubleshooter<br />
If your computer is having problems playing video or audio files in Windows Media Player, try using the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem.<br />
Refer:<br />
Open the Windows&nbsp; Media Player Settings troubleshooter<br />
If your computer is having problems accessing your collection of digital media files in the Windows Media Player Library, try using the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter to fix the problem.<br />
Refer:<br />
Open the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Rebuild Windows Media Player database<br />
If the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the issue, you may rebuild the Windows Media Player database and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
To do this, follow these steps:<br />
a. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
b. Click Start, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player in the Start search box and hit Enter.<br />
c. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
Note: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
d. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
Note: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, in the Start search box and hit Enter.<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp; Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
Note: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong><span>Try to update the sound drivers.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Can&#39;t Get Past Welcome Screen</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi,&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 at the first opportunity on July 30 after registering with Microsoft. The upgrade
 appeared to progress smoothly and I was able to boot the computer to see the new desktop screen. However, very soon after this first boot, the computer asked me to restart to finish the upgrade. This I did and my computer has since been rendered unusable.
 Every time I boot, the computer gets stuck on the welcome screen. It displays the generic circular user icon, with my name written underneath and the word "Welcome" written underneath this. The animated "computer working" icon (the little dots which rotate
 again and again) is displayed next to this. However, it never goes away. I left the computer for 12 hours and nothing changed (the little dots kept on rotating all the while). The computer otherwise appears fine (ie. the multimedia buttons at the top of the
 keyboard work fine) but the OS cannot get past this screen, no matter what I do.</span></p>
<p>To reiterate, the computer doesn't shut down, or freeze. I can hear it working. But it just can't bust through
 that welcome screen, no matter what I try.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have unplugged all USB devices. I have tried booting with the power cable in and out. I have gone into the Advanced
 tab of the setup menu and disabled (and re-enabled) things like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi top test if this makes a difference. Nothing does. As things currently stand, I am completely unable to use my computer and all my files are stranded. Several of them are desperately
 needed.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This has caused huge anguish as my computer has been rendered unusable at a particularly unfortunate moment (ie. I really,
 really need to use the machine and no other will do as the files I need are, currently, only stored on my hard-drive).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FWIW, I have tried pressing F8 to boot the computer in safe mode, but this doesn't seem to work (it results in a back
 lit but otherwise black screen).&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Help!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PS....not forgetting a slow hand clap to Microsoft for continuing their fine recent tradition of getting it wrong</span></p>

************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.<br />

For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />

When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.<br />

    <title>COD Modern Warfare 3 &#124; can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t find any games in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r0ckyex  say:</h3>
<h2>            COD Modern Warfare 3 &#124; can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t find any games in multiplayer</h2>
                    
<p>I completed the campaign in MW3 and it was an awesome experience. Then I head to multiplayer and looked in to games that I can play. But unfortunately there are no games to play the search says "no games found".</p>
<p>As I googled this is an issue that many people are currently experiencing and only happens to Xbox 360 users (which is sux). PC and PS3 users not having such an issue and some say that xbox live doesn't allow IP's from different regions to join global servers
 to prevent the lag, that is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Then what's the point of having such large servers and why PC/PS3 users are not filtered. Also why COD MW 2 and black ops are not having such issues? There's definitely an issue. So I would like to know will they fix this issue or do they just leave it as
 it is or are there any other methods that I can overcome this issue.</p>
<p>Exact issue with more details http://john385.com/</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Temporary Account Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter_au  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporary Account Profile</h2>
                    I have this annoying Temporary Account Profile problem which others have experienced using Vista Home Premium SP2<br />
I can't get rid of the problem.<br />
<ul>
<li>I have tried the instructions as suggested on other posts using kb947242. </li><li>I have activated the Administrator Account as posted under a different subject so as to ensure everything is done under full Admin rights.
</li><li>Using the Admin Account I have deleted all profile accounts (after backing them up to a seperate HDD) using Control Panel/User Accounts/Manage Accounts/Change an Account/Delete an Account, then...
</li><li>Manualy deleted any left over profile accounts (eg <em>name(8), name(9) </em>
which I assume were automatically added by Vista during the Temp Profile debacle<em>
</em>AFTER carrying out kb947242 instructions<em>)</em> ; </li><li>Ensured profiles are not listed under the registry string: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
</li><li>Shut Down </li><li>Re start &amp; make up new profile accounts from fresh, ie not using anything from the backed up old profiles, except the desktop files which were scanned to ensure no nasties were there.
</li></ul>
<br />
Everything great for a few days, then it did it again with the temp profile thing.<br />
<strong>NB This ONLY happens when switching profile accounts; NEVER from a fresh re boot.</strong>
<br />
<br />
I have done a full system scan using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ESET Nod32</span> ; then
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AVIRA premium security suite</span> (<em>latter found TR/Agent.X.412 in a zip file in my email attachments folder on my seperate archive HDD, now deleted into cyberspace).<br />
</em><br />
<br />
Could someone please help - I don't know what else to do other than put up with it (very annoying as involves a re boot whenever it happens) or format the HDD &amp; reload the OS - not really an option.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping someone can help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product are on the machine now and which have EVER been on the machine<br />
even if you uninstalled them (they will leave trouble causing remnants). Something is corrupting the profiles<br />
which could be remnants, malware, hardware such as hard drive issues and even other software.<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption in case it has a role.<br />
<br />
1. Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
2. Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

</span><br />
<br />
3. Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />
<br />
How to Run Check Disk at Startup in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67612-check-disk-chkdsk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67612-check-disk-chkdsk.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then do this -&nbsp;use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times. Do the<br />
same for other accounts that might have problems. Then if needed you can also reset your passwords
<br />
in the accounts. Remember to leave your account as Admin and the others at the level you wish.<br />
<br />
Make another&nbsp;Admin Account&nbsp;with your password&nbsp;and use it to fix the others when needed. (just to
<br />
repair with, not to use as regular account, a safety valve) Always keep a spare ADMIN&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
DO NOT LEAVE THE HAA ENABLED OR USE IT DAILY. If it corrupts you are toast!<br />
<br />
How to Enable or Disable the Real Built-in Administrator Account in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</span></a><br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />
<br />
Fix a corrupted user profile<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-AU/help/769495bf-035c-4764-a538-c9b05c22001e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-AU/help/769495bf-035c-4764-a538-c9b05c22001e1033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You probably need to check for malware and please be thorough as no one product can detect or remove all<br />
malware.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them in
<br />
regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone. (If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

            Wow - thanks for all that<br />
Did everything as suggested, everything reported clean as, all files intact, no malware found, no dodgy apps, no bad sectors, zilch, nothing.<br />
(Some I had already done, eg activating the HAA; deleted all profiles &amp; reloaded incase they were corrupted...)<br />
So where to now?<br />
<br />
Again...<br />
Only get the temp profile thing when a user switches to his account &amp; attempts to log on -&amp; only after previous user has been on for some time.<br />
Never happens from a fresh reboot.<br />
So if a user switches to his account, attempts to log on, gets the annoying Temp Profile thing, waits for the stupid thing to load, then reboots, he has no problem loading his proper profile logging on from this fresh reboot.<br />
This problem is very temperamental so impossible to find what is causing it.<br />
<br />
One work around is to log all 3 users on from a fresh reboot as the problem doesn't seem to happen once all users are logged on.<br />
Hope all this makes sense.<br />
<br />
Again...<br />
I have tried the instructions as suggested on other posts using kb947242.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping there are some more suggestions out there?!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you made all new profiles and the problem still occurs and you did all the suggestions in the tips and links<br />
above about the only thing I can think of is an InPlace Upgrade or a total reinstallation of Windows.<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />

<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span><br />

and of course a complete re-install wiping out all data and programs.<br />

Thought it was getting to this last resort!<br />
Bummer - how annoying!<br />
I'll sit on it over the hols &amp; seriously consider drop kicking Vista out the window &amp; get myself a belated Xmas present early 2010 - Windows 7.<br />
