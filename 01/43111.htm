 and it's as clear as day. More so in the campaign.</strong></span></p>

 to get cut out when getting these games to run properly. Halo 3 had no AA and I think Reach had some variation but nothing great. The most I think I've seen consoles use 2xAA so hopefully we at least see that.</strong></span></p>

<p>Can you clarify on some of the terms you used? I don't think everyone here is a master at understanding video outputs (myself included), so I have no idea what "AA" or "ghosting" is or what "jaggies" are.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>But as far as FPS goes, it's probably something to do with the graphical quality + the old hardware of the Xbox. I'm sure if they could make it perform well at 60fps, they would have done so. We'll probably see that on the next gen console though. Halo 5
 maybe?</p>

<p>Jaggies are jagged lines/rough edges that you get on graphics, AA is abbreviation of Anti-aliasing which is used to get rid of and smooth out jaggies. &nbsp;No idea what ghosting is.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't actually think any games run natively at 1080p on Xbox 360. &nbsp;Old hardware, can't expect to get much more than they will deliver out of it. &nbsp;Just looking at videos so far, the graphics look like an obvious improvement from Halo 3/Reach. &nbsp;Higher framerate
 would be nice but honestly i'm not gonna complain, I care more for gameplay than graphics, I only recently got a HD TV and I don't own a gaming rig so even old PC games I play on low quality settings.</p>

<p>No idea what ghosting is.</p>
<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>This is a decent example of Ghosting:</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.eurogamer.net%2farticles%2f%2fa%2f1%2f0%2f8%2f2%2f6%2f5%2f7%2fbadmotion_2.jpg.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Now it isn't too noticable in MP but in single player, it stands out a lot. I recently went and played a small bit of the campaign and it stood out like a sore thumb. It resembles motion blur but this is on a whole other
 scale. It was a pretty hot topic after the games launch. Some people called it a "glitch" but it was way beyond just a simple glitch.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><strong>=</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Btw, I've heard Halo will have no (normal) motion blur at all. Considering motion blur can tax your GPU a bit more on the PC, they probably thought it was a better idea to get rid of it in favour of a better resolution
 and so on.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><strong>=</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>And yeah AA means Anti Aliasing. There's loads of different types of AA but the one goal is to "remove" jagged lines from games and smooth out the image quality. Without AA, what is meant to be a straight line will look
 more like a staircase and even worse, during movement, that line will look something closer to a escalator as the jagged line moves and flickers.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><strong>=</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>The bigger the screen, the more AA you'll need to tone down the jaggies. For example, I play on a 32" so I generally use 4xMSAA. MSAA being one type of AA, there's also FXAA, TXAA and so on. Each with their own upsides
 and downsides. The big issue with AA is that the more you have, the more taxing it is on your hardware. Performance will drop.</strong></span></p>

<p>I never had a problem with H3's graphics, there's a value in moderate, effective playability. Doesn't have to be a full on Skyrim/Call of Duty crossover for ridiculous graphics.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>30 FPS does interest me, however... I know not all games at 30 FPS look the same, so hopefully they can make it pretty damn smooth and nice to play, but that does seem like a fairly heavy risk.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>No there's definitely a difference. As someone who has gotten used to 60fps on the PC, going back to 30 has been quite jarring. Plus if you get a drop in FPS with 60 being the norm, you're still playing at a playable fps.
 While dropping from 30fps is way worse since 30 is generally considered the minimal before it becomes unplayable.</strong></span></p>

<p>There definitely is a noticeable difference from 30 to 60 fps. Take a look at <a href="http://boallen.com/fps-compare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this website</a> for a comparison between 15, 30, and 60. Big differences.</p>

<p>In Reach, a lot of cutscenes dropped significantly in frame rate, and it was very noticeable. Things would get blurred, choppy, and slow.</p>

<p>Well this kid from xbox live said that he doxed all my info.He said he knew my name, address, email address, phone number, console id, and guess what he did.So he called microsoft posing as me saying that someone stole his account and posed as me.He provided
 microsoft with all the information that was on my account.So I called microsoft and they said for me to just change my email and everything will be alright.So I just changed it now, I will see what happens.His gamertag is:
<strong>[GT REMOVED]</strong>. So if we can please get this hacker off Xbox Live Im sure it will make it much safer on Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. There is a possibility that the maximum usage of memory is not selected on your system configuration, and your BIOS don't allow your computer to use the maximum memory installed. To troubleshoot this, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: <strong>Enable Maximum memory</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, and type in <strong>
msconfig </strong>then hit enter. </li><li>In the <strong>System Configuration</strong> window, click <strong>
Advanced options</strong> on the <strong>Boot</strong> tab.</li><li>Click to clear the <strong>Maximum memory</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: <strong>Update the system BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To update the BIOS on your computer, visit the Web site of your computer manufacturer to download the BIOS update. Or, contact your computer manufacturer for help.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: <strong>Memory remapping </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Memory remapping will allow your computer to use more than 3GB of physical memory (RAM). Please make sure that you are using
<strong>Windows 10 X64</strong> because <strong>Windows 10 X86</strong> can't support memory more than 4GB. You can enable the memory remapping feature in the BIOS by booting to the system setup. See the User's Guide for your computer for instructions on how
 to boot to system setup on your computer. The name for the memory remapping feature may be different for different hardware vendors. This can be listed as memory remapping, memory extension, or something similar. Be aware that your computer may not support
 the memory remapping feature.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4: <strong>Change the AGP video aperture size in the BIOS settings</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the BIOS settings to see how much memory that you have allocated to AGP video aperture. This is the memory that the system is sharing with the video card that is used for texture mapping and rendering. This memory would not be used by the system,
 because it is locked by the video card. You can adjust the AGP video aperture size in the BIOS. Standard settings are "32MB,""64MB,""128MB,"and "Auto." After you change this setting in the BIOS, restart your computer, and then check the usable memory. You
 can test each setting to see which offers the best results.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 Fails to install on a tablet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Fails to install on a tablet</h2>
                    <p>The tablet is a Cube iWork 8 air pro.&nbsp; Its drive is only 32Gb, so I've removed the Android stuff and deleted the old Windows partition to prevent the new installation from trying to back up the old one.&nbsp; Space is so limited that I couldn't complete the W10
 v1803 download - hence a new install.&nbsp; I used the media creation tool to create a .iso image and Rufus to create a bootable USB from the image. [The mct USB installer was not recognised as bootable by the UEFI "BIOS"]&nbsp; The installer runs through all the initial
 steps without any issues.&nbsp; Then it gets to the "We need to restart" stage and does so.&nbsp; At which point, I get an error message "A required device is not available"&nbsp; Error code X0C0000225.&nbsp; Using the recovery options command prompt, I find there is no Windows
 installation present on the disk.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

<p>Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found the answer.&nbsp; There was a hidden partition on the disk containing the EFI boot data from the original installation so I ended up with Windows 10 installing a second partition for the EFI boot after that.&nbsp; Of course, the UEFI 'BIOS' used the first one
 to initialise windows and it was pointing at the second one as the location of the system files which, obviously, weren't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 on a Lenovo P71. When I examined the update history, I noticed that one of the updates was KB4048955, which apparently is intended for amd64 machines. Since the P71 has an Intel processor I wonder why is the amd64 update installed?</p>

            Hi Bostjian.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's actually AMD enforcing their patent on x64 bit technology which they invented, so that now their name has to be attached to it.   That's all. 
<br />
<br />It's safe to choose the if you have x64 bit.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi BostjanVi, 
<br />
<br />AMD invented and owns the rights to the 64bit technology built into all 64bit chips
<br />
<br />So whether you have an AMD A12 or an Intel i7, you need to take those updates to keep your system current
<br />
<br />Check in your C:\Windows folder you will find lots of SysWOW64 technology in that folder on all 64bit Systems

            This is normal. AMD developed the x86-x64 instruction set which was launched in 2003 as the AMD64 processor. Microsoft actually worked with AMD in the early days to create the AMD64 processor. With this in mind, the labeling of cumulative updates that target 64 bit processors will carry the AMD designation/copyright. Intel actually licensed AMD's 64 bit technology to use in their Intel 64 processors introduced in 2005.

            <p>Hii all<br />
<br />
First, I'm new and i don't know if i'm right here but ... here I am.<br />
<br />
I use Windows 10 too and i was realy annoyed, caused by the new Windows Update. So i was looking for a way to get the old Windows Update back and found this thread. With all of your tips and tricks, i made a new Control Panel entry, to&nbsp;<strong>get the old Windows
 Update back</strong>&nbsp;- as good as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, I made it only for&nbsp;<strong>english language</strong>&nbsp;and only for&nbsp;<strong>64 bit Windows 10</strong>&nbsp;machines.<br />
<br />
In the case, that this is not the original Windows Update from Win7 / 8, I will need some people who can test it if it realy works well. After "installation" you will have a new Control Panel entry, what looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7295628-d8a7-426b-bedf-5e655493a16e" /><br />
<br />
As you can see, i use the german OS and made it english so everyone can read it.<br />
<br />
You will have four different links, which i will explain now a little bit:<br />
1. "Show or hide Updates" if you click here or directly on the Logo or "Windows Update" itself, it will open and start wushowhide.diacab with UAC prompt<br />
2. "Open new Windows Update" if you click here, the new and original Windows Update for Windows 10 will open</p>
<p>3. "Delete installed Updates" if you click here, you will be redirected to the Installed Updates page.<br />
4. "En-/Disable automatic Updates" if you click here, accept the UAC prompt an Enable or Disable the annoying automatic Updates. If you hit this link, just the UAC will come up and first you won't see anything. Just go after hitting this link to the advanced
 settings page for Windows Update and you will see this:<br />

You here you see the german version of the advanced settings page, but in the drop-down-menu is now "Never search for Updates" enabled and you realy have to search for updates manually.<br />
..and if you wish to get the automatic Updates back, just hit the link "En-/Disable automatic Update" in the old new Control Panel applet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I made everything with CMD or PS and i use VBS for some little things.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1EleAtb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Get the new old Windows Update back!">If you wish to give it a try, please download it here from OneDrive.</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I wish to create the best possibility to get my own hands over Win Update, if you have more ideas to implement or to change please tell it to us. Maybe i can tweak something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That was all for the first time.... Thank you for reading!<br />

</p><p><span>Hi mister, this tool is really great, I would appreciate, if it is possible to make 32bit version. I have Windows 10 tablet, I disabled WU service, but store wasn t working. So I had to reenable WU manually, visited the store and
 after 15 minutes I realised that crappy WU downloaded 6 updates and stole 3gigabytes from my little system storage. It has 16 gigs, I made clean install and there was about 6,5gb, which is ok, but 6 updates and 3 gigabytes away? I will be so happy if you can
 make this for X86 system, please !</span></p>

            Thanks for quick reply - my tablet has only 1GB of RAM, so I think it would be painful if I install x64 edition. will this applet work for Home edition?

    <title>Moving files from one directory to another extremely slow in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve compton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving files from one directory to another extremely slow in Windows 10</h2>
                    In Windows 10, when I try to move a large number of files from one folder to another on my C drive, it takes a long time. &nbsp;The file count goes up by about 20 or 30 files at a time. &nbsp;As the number of files moved approaches the number in the dialog, bumps
 the number by another 20 or 30. &nbsp; Altogether it takes minutes to move the files. &nbsp;If I move the files to my NAS, it takes 20 seconds. &nbsp;When the computer was Windows 7, moves were pretty much instantaneous. &nbsp;

 talk with the monitor company (Dell) for their software (built-in camera).&nbsp; Dell website says no driver, I need to talk to Skype...</p>
<p>Device manager verifies there is no driver.&nbsp; Audio on Skype is fine.&nbsp; How can I confirm my camera and find drivers??!!</p>

<br />Can you launch say the Camera app in Windows 10 and check if the web cam works or not?

<p>Hi again, Ruwim, and thanks so much for your time and consideration.&nbsp; But no, it never occurred to me that I had to make a physical connection to a built-in camera!&nbsp; Only time I ever tried to use any such device it was on a laptop, and I now understand that
<em>they</em> are connected internally - possibly not the case here...</p>
<p>fought through the dust and&nbsp; cobwebs to look at my monitor backside (Dell SP2208WFP - about 5-6 old?) and the only possible open connection is a sub port, but isn't that for old VGA input connections?&nbsp; Or to the camera, perhaps?&nbsp; No ideas, however, about
 the camera itself...</p>
<p>Does any of that help?</p>
<p>Thanks again...</p>

<p>Hi Andre, and thank you for your time.&nbsp; I've never tried before, so I can't say that it ever worked/was connected, and with this brand new machine, all up to date (except for a five+ year old Dell SP2208WFP monitor), I do have the Windows Camera software
 installed - but it can't find the camera, either directly or from Skype.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was about a USB connection to the screen - the only available port is an SUB, which I always thought of as a VGA input...???</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>You should have a USB A-female upstream port on that model. Using a standard USB 2.0 A-male to B-male cable (what you find with many USB printers), you should be able to connect the USB hub in your monitor to a free USB port on your computer. This will essentially
 allow you to use the USB ports on the back of the monitor (usually for use with other low-powered/bandwidth USB devices) and the onboard internal USB-based webcam. The other connector you were referring to is probably the soundbar power connector. Once properly
 detected, Windows 10 will probably install the generic USB Video Device drivers that come with the OS, allowing you to use the camera with Skype.</p>

            Hi Steven,
<br />
<br />It looks like the monitors built in web cam is not certified for Skype. It looks like you will have to make a compromise and purchase a certified compatible USB Web cam for Skype. 
<br />
<br />Dell doesn't even list drivers on its website:

<p>Thanks for your input - I really appreciate your time.&nbsp; Haven't had time to test this yet.&nbsp; My configuration is that I have several external drives plugged into the usb ports on the monitor side, and I'll test making the connection you suggest.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The answer to your questions is yes, they can both be interchangeable. The 24-watt power supply designed for the Surface RT and Surface 2 can be used to charge the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, but the charging will take longer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The power supply for the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 can be used to charge the Surface RT and the Surface 2 as well, however, it will not charge them faster.</span></p>

    <title>How to Uninstall Ethernet Controller, PERMANENTLY. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ccvincent  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Uninstall Ethernet Controller, PERMANENTLY.</h2>
                    <p>Without Resetting or Reinstalling Windows, again, that is.</p>
<p>I've been having major issues with poor performance, and can see abnormal disc activity resulting in apps freezing since Windows 1803 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both after Reinstalling and after Resetting Windows, I began to notice some unresponsiveness about the time I was reinstalling network drivers.</p>
<p>I don't have any current need for Ethernet connection, but thought I would install the driver just in case.</p>
<p>Now, when I uninstall the Ethernet Controller Driver disc activity looks a <em>
lot</em> better.</p>
<p>The trouble is, it keeps being reinstalled every time I Restart or Shutdown and start up the system. Even if I destroy the driver software, including in C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository, the Ethernet Controller reappears in Device Manager.
 Broken, of course, and I think that actually makes my problems worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated.</p>

            Hi Colin -
<br />
<br />Have you tried uninstalling Chrome, restart PC, then reinstall Chrome.  Make sure to back up your Favorites, or sign into Chrome to do this which is the best method.  
<br />
<br />I have no confidence that KIS is gone or even that their highly suspicious ethernet connection (never heard of before by an AV) is not still snooping.  
<br />
<br />So what I would do at this point is wipe the drive to do a Clean install of WIndows 10  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media  install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.

            Colin:  What's the antivirus? 
<br />
<br />I would not trust MBAM Real Time as anything other than the finest on-demand scanner, and will no longer vouch for it to be run alongside Defender.  So especially with this challenge I would unintsall it.  
<br />
<br />Are you confident your drivers are all the latest?  
<br />
<br />Do you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware?  
<br />
<br />Do you have actual crashes which are saving crash files we can analyze?  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Computer Management, then Event Viewer &gt; Custom View.  Google any repeat errors verbatim with error number to find how others resolved them.  
<br />
<br />If this problem persists you might want to Clean install the last working version and then immediately hide Version 1803 using Hide Updates tool, keep Updates turned off with a Metered Connection until it can be blocked:

<h2>            My laptop shuts down randomly by itself</h2>
                    I've had my Dell laptop for almost two years now. It always worked fine until a few months ago, when it started doing this. I hadn't installed any new programs or anything, so I kind of figured it was just overheating.&nbsp; It gets extremely annoying though,
 and since it always worked fine until just a few months ago, maybe it's something other than overheating. Thanks

            As far as the BIOS updates go... Go to Dell's support site and plug in your service tag. &nbsp;Check the downloads section, and see what items are available in the BIOS section. &nbsp;Or, you could indicate what model of laptop you have, and someone else could do
 the same. &nbsp;Then, run msinfo32.exe from the Start-&gt;Run box, and check the value of "BIOS Version / Date" on the right. &nbsp;Compare the latest available version with what's listed in msinfo32. &nbsp;It could be that a BIOS update could make adjustments that would affect
 the behavior.
<div><br />
<div>After two years, a laptop can collect dust in a bunch of places. &nbsp;The dust impedes heat dissipation and airflow, which can contribute to the type of problems you're having. &nbsp;Depending on the model laptop, it can be relatively straightforward to blow out
 the dust with compressed air, or otherwise clean things up a bit. &nbsp; Fans should be held in place though - not allowed to spin when being blown off. &nbsp;My Dell laptop has a removable fan (two small screws need to be removed)&nbsp;that can be blown out&nbsp;easily. &nbsp;This
 also provides access to the heat sink fins.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some laptops also have a removable filter that trap dust, and should be periodically checked and cleaned.</div>

            <p><span>Hello Rhys,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This AHCI device error is generate from the BIOS' S.M.A.R.T. detection. It has absolutely nothing to do with your operating system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At the time you see this error message, the operating system has not been yet started.<span>&nbsp;
</span>S.M.A.R.T. has detected that your hard drive at port 0 is faulty and the drive may or may not be accessible. Your hard drive may fail any time once this happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, as per the description provided, it looks like your system freezes while auto-detecting
</span><span>AHCI Port on your Windows 7 Operating System, let me know if this is not the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Is there any external devices connected to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. What type of hard drive are you using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Do you have Windows 7 installation disk?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. What is the make and model of the laptop?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect all the external devices connected with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2:</span></strong><span> </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a SATA Hard disk, then switch the AHCI port to IDE port and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if there a <span>loose fitting data and power cables/connectors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the boot order sequence from BIOS to “Boot from disc” and then try booting from the disc and perform a startup repair and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Insert the Windows&nbsp;7 installation disc or USB flash drive, or a system repair disc, and then shut down your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Restart your computer using the computer's power button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When prompted, press any key, and then follow the instructions that appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. On the Install Windows page, or on the System Recovery Options page, choose your language and other preferences, and then click next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If neither the Install Windows page nor the System Recovery Options page appears, and you're not asked to press any key, you might need to change some system settings. To learn how to do this, see

<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;If you are using the Windows installation disc or USB flash drive, click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Select the Windows installation you want to repair, and then click next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. On the System Recovery Options menu, click a tool to open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Select the option Startup repair.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then I would recommend you to upgrade or reinstall the drivers and check if it helps.</p>

            I can't do any of those methods because the PC will not let me go to the boot menu and almost as soon as I turn it on the error pops up and it freezes.

            <p>Suatcini,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and the option to Pin to Start or Pin to Taskbar does not show up when you right click on a desktop shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention "registry corruption", but how would you know if that's the problem or if Windows 10 just overlooked this ability because they concentrated so much on "apps" in this release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't listen to any training videos yet that don't tout the use of "apps" while ignoring the use of "programs". Yes, sometimes those terms seem to be used interchangeably, but sometimes they are really quite different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have desktop links that open a specific browser and take me to a specific web page. Those are the links I'd like to add to my Start menu because those links take me to specific work related sites I need every day. I don't want to have to search my desktop
 to find them - I want them on my Start menu.</p>

            I created a shortcut on my desktop to a program in Program Files folder. When I right-click this shortcut, it gives me a menu, which has "Pin to start screen" and "Pin to task bar" options. Maybe I misunderstood you. I may have confused a shortcut to a
 web page with&nbsp;a shortcut to something else. I just created a shortcut to a web page and right-clicking did not give me the options.&nbsp;Sorry for causing you inconvenience.

<p>Unfortunately, this will not help Jeff_in_SM but may be what you need.&nbsp; Go to the desired website in Edge, click on the three dots in the upper right hand corner to get the drop down menu, choose pin to start:</p>

<p>Sandra Milo - I tried doing exactly what you suggested.&nbsp; The shortcut does&nbsp;appear on Start, but as an Edge shortcut, as you would expect.&nbsp; I use IE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know a way to create an IE shortcut on Start?</p>

            This doesn't work if it is a shortcut that's on the desktop.&nbsp; There is no 'pin to start' option on the pop-up menu.

            At first, you can create a shortcut in your Programs folder&nbsp;
<div>(in a hidden folder C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs). The shortcut appears in
<em>All apps</em> list. Then you can pin it to Start menu / Taskbar as Mayank Gupta10 suggested.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The common way is to create a shortcut on the Desktop.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But the more elegant way is creating Custom toolbars.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>As you have not specified what sort of speakers (plugged into rear panel, or USB), or</p>
<p>what the directions were that you were given previously -<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The following may not apply to USB speakers ? )</p>
<p>- In Realtek HD Audio Manager there are two important settings in the top right corner<br />
</p>
<p>of the Window (I'm using ALC892, but newer versions may be a bit diffrent).<br />
</p>
<p>If you have <em>Device advanced settings</em>,&nbsp; set to - <em>Make front and rear... simultaneously</em> ,<br />
</p>
<p>and in the yellow folder below have ticked -<em> Disable front panel jack detection</em>,</p>
<p>you will not get sound from your speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There is a small chance of conflict between AMD HD audio and Realtek HD audio.<br />
</p>
<p>Uninstall the AMD HD audio if you are not using HDMI for your sound.<br />
</p>
<p>Or, if using HDMI for sound, uninstall the Realtek drivers. <br />
</p>
<p>- It is suggested to download the Realtek drivers from the mfg of your motherboard, or laptop,<br />
</p>
<p>not from Realtek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are several configuration options for when using both speakers and headphones -</p>
<p>- In the Device advanced settings option if you select:<br />
<br />
<em>Make front and rear output... simultaneously</em>, the speakers will be disabled when the
</p>
<p>headphones are plugged in, and the speakers will function when the headphones are unplugged.<br />
- This option also allows you to set-up the configuration (Sound Effects, etc.).&nbsp; for the headphones&nbsp; to be different from the speakers.<br />
(The option&nbsp; Mute the rear...plugged in&nbsp; does not offer an option to set-up a different configuration<br />
for the headphones from the speakers, but works the same otherwise).<br />
<br />
Also -&nbsp; If you tick the box next to&nbsp; <em>Disable front panel jack detection</em>&nbsp; and select -<br />
<em>Make front and rear output... simultaneously</em> the speakers will not work if you unplug the headphones.<br />
- If you select - <em>Mute the rear...plugged in</em> , &nbsp; both speakers and headphones will<br />
operate simultaneously, and when the headphones are unplugged the speakers will still function.<br />
<br />
<br />
- To allow the headphones to always show in Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback Devices,</p>
<p>R/click on any of the Devices listed and tick Show Disabled Devices and Show Disconnected Devices.<br />
<br />
NOTE: If playing games, in most cases you need to plug the headphones in before launching the game or the audio in the game will not work (if using the first option. Not sure about the others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists you may find some help on the Realtek forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you open the event viewer logs and check for the complete errors.</div>
<div><br />
Refer: <strong>Open Event Viewer<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a>
<br />
Also refer: <br />
<strong>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</a>
<div><br />
Post the information from the logs.</div>
<div><br />
Check if you are able to launch Minecraft launcher by referring the steps below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;Double click to run the Minecraft launcher.<br />
b)&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, type “<strong>task manager</strong>” without quotes in the stsrt –search box and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
c)&nbsp;That will open up the <strong>task manager </strong>window.<br />
d)&nbsp;Go to the <strong>Processes </strong>tab and in the list of processes search for a process related to minecraft launcher.<br />
e)&nbsp;Right click and <strong>End </strong>the process.<br />
f)&nbsp;Once done, close the task manager window.<br />
g)&nbsp;Restart the Minecraft launcher again and check if it works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information is helpful.<br />
        </p>
