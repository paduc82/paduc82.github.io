    <title>Bluetooth still not fixed&#63; Microsoft should be ASHAMED of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth still not fixed&#63;  Microsoft should be ASHAMED of themselves.</h2>
                    <p>SERIOUSLY.&nbsp; I'm that guy constantly backing Microsoft to all my friends and family that buy Apple and Samsung Android products.&nbsp; I talk about the interconnectivity of all the devices&nbsp;and how I own an Xbox, PC, Surface, and Windows phone.&nbsp; But sadly, Windows
 8 was released October of 2012 and they still have problems connecting to Bluetooth, a technology that has been around for YEARS and is pretty much standard now a days.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I'm talking about is that when you go to PC Settings, PC and devices, then Bluetooth, it will instantly start searching for available Bluetooth devices.&nbsp; You pair a device and it works perfectly.&nbsp; But like any other device, you are not going to be connected
 forever.&nbsp; So after you cut off the paired device or turn off your Windows 8 device, you eventually cut them back on.&nbsp; When you go to reconnect to the device it is no longer connected and doesn't connect when you click on the device that is sitting there right
 in your face.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After initial research many people quickly figured out that the way to re-connect is to go to the desktop, right click on the volume button, click playback devices, right click on the Bluetooth device, then click connect.&nbsp; Yes, I know, this way works every
 time.&nbsp; But it is time consuming and is not very intuitive to a touch screen based UI.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When this was first brought up in the forums WAY back in October of 2012 on the message boards Microsoft&nbsp;said that they were working on it.&nbsp; Months and Months went by with Microsoft representatives saying that it was being worked on even up until this past
 March of 2013.&nbsp; Now its the End of 2013 going in to 2014 and Microsoft has released countless updates, a whole new system update in 8.1, and the Surface 2, and this issue STILL is not resolved.&nbsp; In fact a Microsoft person closed the thread on the issue earlier
 this month as though the issue had been resolved.&nbsp; Basically saying, we are not going to bother to fix the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is just SAD.&nbsp; I know its a software issue because I see this same issue on both my Laptop AND my Surface.&nbsp; The issue was on both my laptop and surface when they were Windows 8, and are still there now that they are upgraded to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Seems like
 now all the issues are now shared across all devices.&nbsp; Will they EVER fix this issue?</p>

            <p>I have many Bluetooth devices, it doesn't matter which device I use.&nbsp; The problem isn't connecting a device, its the re-connecting of a device after its already paired.&nbsp; For example I have a Jambox.&nbsp; If I go to the windows settings like I stated above its
 sitting right there.&nbsp; Now lets say I disconnect the Jambox because I want to pair the jambox with my cell phone to play music.&nbsp; Then later I want to watch a movie on my pc and have the audio come out through my jambox Bluetooth speaker again.&nbsp; If I disconnect
 the Bluetooth from my phone and jambox, then go to connect it back to my pc OR surface, it will not reconnect through the setting.&nbsp; Try it, see if it works.&nbsp; I've seen TONS of people on here have this same issue.&nbsp; Its not my device as my Jambox can connect
 to every other device I have with no problem and everyone I know who has a device can connect and re-connect to my Jambox with no issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Funny thing is I know its not an issue with windows not being compatible because it connected the first time and can be connected back to the jambox EVERYTIME by either re-pairing, or by going through the long inconvenient way of going through the&nbsp;desktop.&nbsp;
 However, this is not a solution to the issue that windows 8/8.1 still does not re-connect to&nbsp;device like it should.&nbsp;</p>

            Couldn't agree more, this is easily the biggest disappointment in Windows, the main thing that makes me think twice about getting a Windows tablet. Bluetooth works absolutely seamlessly on my Android phone, with Windows I might as well go back to wires...
 It's a shame Microsoft doesn't seem to be taking the issue very seriously - it's hard to understand why it would be hard to resolve...

<h2>            Re-use tapes written by NT-Backup in DMP 2012</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to re-use our 'old' tapes written by NT-Backup in MS DPM 2012. However DPM complains about the blocksize and therefore cannot erase the tape. I've read that there is a program 'MyTape.exe' which should be able to erase the tape so DPM can use
 it. I can't find the program though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who knows where to get the MyTape.exe program to erase the 'old' tapes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Hello Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your system has been updated, it will make changes to your computer such as removing outdated features, delivering bug fixes for a certain issue on your computer, adding new features, and especially removing any security threats. To properly isolate
 the issue, may we know the reason why you did not update your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we suggest that you use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. To do this, you can refer to this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the programs you mentioned are Players, and will not fix or play a damaged file...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attach a couple of links for things to try... The EASEUS has a free version but it is limited to 2GB, and your's is larger than that... It still may be helpful if you look at the instructions at the bottom of the page to run a Windows Repair feature...
 ChkDsk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already ran this and it indicated a small number of bad sectors... You only need a few for a video to not play... The process you ran was to CHECK... There are options to REPAIR as well, which the instructions describe...</p>

            Try downloading the .iso using this method:
<br />
<br />You can try to ‚Äòcon‚Äô the browser into thinking it isn‚Äôt using Windows, an explanation by Andre here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-user-ag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-user-ag</a>... 
<br />
<br />There are several ways you can access the developer tools in Edge. The quickest way is to press F12 on your keyboard. Another way is from the More actions menu (‚Ä¶) &gt; F12 Developer Tools. 
<br />Select the Emulation tab then click in the User agent string list box. 
<br />Choose an appropriate web browser you would like to test in. Both Edge and Internet Explorer support a variety of modes, including Opera, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. When selected, the page you are browsing will be refreshed in real time, letting you see how it behaves in that particular web browser. 
<br />
<br />I‚Äôd choose Safari. 
<br />Make sure you‚Äôre on the windows iso site:

<h2>            Windows 10 1809 start menu tiles only showing down arrows</h2>
                    I've tried EVERY fix posted/available and NOTHING works. The only thing I haven't tried is doing a fresh install because I don't feel I should have to considering the previous versions (1709 and 1803) were both clean installs and I never had a problem
 with the start menu. I've only had a problem since the 1809 update and first it was only a few tiles showing up, now it's all tiles are there but they're just blank or showing a down arrow. Microsoft needs to fix this asap and people like me shouldn't have
 to go through so much stuff (cmd prompt, powershell, display driver, dism, etc) attempting to fix something Microsoft messed up with their update. When is the fix for this gonna happen??? I know I'm not the only one going through this.

            Hi Rick, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your apps have somehow unlinked from the Start menu. Do the apps still work if you access them another way? Or are the apps non-functional?
<br />
<br />You could try relinking the apps to your Start menu by finding them in File Explorer or the Start Menu App list, then right-clicking and clicking Pin to Start.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if reinstalling the default apps for Windows can fix the issue.

<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go and I'll see what else we can try if it doesn't work! Thanks!

            Rick,
<br />
<br />If you don't already have a USB Recovery Stick, create one using the .iso download found here.
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You may have to change the boot order in Bios to boot from the USB. 
<br />
<br />Startup Repair:
<br />To access the recovery environment, turn your computer on and off three times.  While booting, make sure you turn off the computer when you see the Windows logo. After the third time, Windows 10 will boot into diagnostics mode. Click Advanced options when the recovery screen appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Startup Repair

            Didn't work for me either... Only started having this problem after I updated to 1809. Start menu was working fine beforehand. Tried every tweak/fix I've seen/been suggested and still nothing is working. Even with windows getting updates my start menu
 still is messed up.

<h2>            4tb external Hard drive not recognized by XBOX ONE X.</h2>
                    Ive had my 4tb for about 6mo now and its been great. It works fine and never had anybissues until a few days ago. I started my xbox as per usual, and went to start a game. However, it brought me to the MS store instead. When i looked in storage my External
 Hard Drive was not there. I tried every troubleshooting technique offered, and nothing works

<p>HI Ronin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. For us to better assist, do you mind clarifying what steps you took to troubleshoot this issue? Are you hearing any clicking coming from the hard drive itself? Also, be sure to try swapping cables and the port used on the Xbox One.</p>

<p>No problem. I have switched ports, power cycled, connected the ext hd to my windows laptop (which tells me its fine), reset my console (keeping games and apps), i have changes the power settings, and unplugging the external hard drive power supply.</p>
<p>Its making more of a ‚Äúrhythmic buzzing‚Äù type of sound. Louder than usual i think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ronin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be many different answers to that. Could be just not connecting well, could be corrupt data on the hard drive itself. Re-formatting is another troubleshooting step. If it doesn't connect after a reformat then the external hard drive went bad
 most likely.</p>

</p><p>I have a few hard drive set up myself, So hopefully we can get to the bottom of this. Is your external hard drive self powered or powered from the console?.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok that might be the issue with it self, Due to the more storage is used the more power is required I suggest trying to get an self powered (One that plugs into the outlet) external hard drive enclosure and taking the hard drive from the first enclosure&nbsp;
 and placing it into that.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software changes on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have User Account Control enabled?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to turn off<strong> User Account Control</strong> and also disable any Anti-virus application and then try installing the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Turn User Account Control on or off</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:
</b>User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We don't
 recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon
 as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>If the steps do not help, proceed to method 2:</p>

<p>I was working on trying to get CoD Black Ops to load the servers and I was told to try:</p>
<p><span>1. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong><br />
2. Click "<strong>Change Adapter Setting</strong>" from the top left.<br />
3. Right click where your internet comes from.<br />
4. Choose&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;from popped up menu.<br />
5. Switch to&nbsp;<strong>Sharing tab</strong><br />
6. Uncheck the following options under the sharing tab:<br />
Allow other network users to connect through this computers Internet Connection.<br />
Allow other network uses to control or disable the shared connection.<br />
7. Right click the&nbsp;<strong>wireless selection</strong>, if you use a ethernet cable or are somehow hooked up to your internet modem by cable. Just right click Local Area Connection instead.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>But for obvious reasons I cant since I dont have the sharing tab or cant find an&nbsp;equivalence of that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any ideas?&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reason why you can't sign in to your Microsoft account, is because the type of device you‚Äôre activating doesn‚Äôt match the type of device you linked to your digital license. To resolve you issue, we suggest that you follow the troubleshooting
 steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fil-ph/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. This can help you reactivate Windows using the Activation troubleshooter if you make a significant hardware change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and give us an update with the result.

<p>What was the hardware change, if it was the motherboard then that may mean a new licence key is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original upgrade to Windows 10 was based on the original OS if that was a pre-installed OEM version of Windows 7 or 8 then that lives and dies with the device. (motherboard) You would need to purchase a new licence key if that was the case.</p>

<p>It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

            I Think what AreilMT is getting at with the HDD light flashing is this:<br />
<br />
If you have a chkdsk scheduled to run on the next reboot (by responding in the affirmative to the question when choosing to run a chkdsk on the next reboot), or if XP finds that any volume on your system that has been marked "dirty", chkdsk is going to run
 when you reboot.<br />
<br />
If you boot in Safe Mode and chkdsk starts to run, the last thing you will see on the screen is mup.sys having been loaded...&nbsp; then the chkdsk is going to run to completion.&nbsp; Your system will appear to be stuck.<br />
<br />
If the system appears to be hung on mup.sys and the HDD light is flashing, it could be that chkdsk is doing what it is supposed to do or what you told it to do - checking the volume(s) for consistency.&nbsp; If that is the case and the HDD light is flashing, you
 need to wait it out and that could take many/several hours depending on the size of your HDD, how much stuff is on it and what chkdsk finds to do.&nbsp; Let it sit overnight if you have to, but be patient.<br />
<br />
If that is NOT the case, then I suggest you power off, unplug everything except the keyboard and see if you can boot in Safe Mode with only a keyboard attached.&nbsp; If you have a PS/2 keyboard to use, I would use that instead of a USB keyboard.&nbsp; Sometimes a faulty
 USB device or driver can cause the system to appear to hang on mup.sys.<br />
<br />
It is also important to realize that the problem is not with mup.sys (it has already loaded) - it is what comes
<br />
This is why it makes zero sense when people see this scenario and start trying to figure out how to replace mup.sys - that is not the problem since it has already loaded.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The next thing to load that sometimes causes problems is often keyboard and mouse drivers - especially USB keyboards and mouses (mice) devices, hence, you should unplug everything - especially USB devices.&nbsp; You only need a keyboard connected to press F8 to
 get to the Advanced Boot Options menu and choose Safe Mode and a PS/2 keyboard should be used if you can get your hands on one.<br />

<h2>            Desktop shortcut icon opens a blank page</h2>
                    <p>We develop software for niche industry. Many of our users are reporting a problem where the desktop shortcut/icon (which opens a google chrome page) is instead opening a blank page. Nothing has changed on our side. This is very frustrating for our users.
 Any suggestions or help welcome! The page we are opening is https without any errors. We know Windows 7 users are affected, but we think more versions of Windows are affected also</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 sees my camera. But not contents of Compact Flash media.</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Win 7 Pro 64bit to the comparable Win10 os.</p>
<p>When I plug my Fuji camera containing the Compact flash drive into the PC to download my pictures the pc recognises the camera in 'explorer' by name, it also recognises the size of the files on it ie 3.4gb. but when I try to open the 'external memory' it
 claims that there is nothing to download.</p>
<p>I've tried downloading onto a Win 7 laptop which I have, and there is no problem.&nbsp; The problem has just occurred since the upgrade.</p>
<p>Ive asked Fuji if they can assist and await a response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help........</p>

<p><span>Hi Brian, </span></p>

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Good Day! </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your query. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Going back, you can delete your contact using your device, just top the contacts and option to delete/call/send SMS etc. will show, just make sure your
<strong>supported OS version </strong>is up to date to avoid the incompatibility issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If not yet, we strongly suggest to do troubleshooting steps. First, uninstall Skype app, then update your supported OS, once completed re ‚Äìinstall the Skype app again.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is to avoid the incompatibility issue. As Skype continuously evolves to offer our users the latest technology. Therefore, Skype has been transitioning from a peer-to-peer architecture to a cloud infrastructure.</span></p>

<p>My OS IS up to date, as is Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my screenshot shows. After taping the contact name I am given the choice to delete the chat or block the user. Nowhere am I given the option to simply delete the contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can think of scenarios where deleting a Skype contact is preferable to blocking.</p>

    <title>Invisible files and &#47; or folders in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stocktiki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisible files and &#47; or folders in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering if anyone else has encountered this issue over a file or folder being invisible from Windows Explorer (Windows 7 Home Premium 32).</p>
<p>It works like this. Windows Explorer shows you have three subfolders in the \Program Files\ folder: Folder A, Folder B and Folder C.</p>
<p>However, when you go to save a file from Internet Explorer (by right-clicking and choosing Save), and in the resulting save dialog box in the \Program Files\ folder, you now see four subfolders: Folder A, Folder B, Folder C and Folder D. Interestingly, Folder
 D (which is invisible in Windows Explorer) has a lock on the folder icon when you see if in the Save dialog box.</p>
<p>Noticed this with both a folder and a file.</p>
<p>Is this caused by some sort of permissions issue? Anyone else finding this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This question was unjustly marked as answered (but seems to have been subsequently unmarked - good stuff!), so i posted a similar question here;<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/26fc08f9-1ff7-431f-9db4-5858f2aadba5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/26fc08f9-1ff7-431f-9db4-5858f2aadba5</a><br />
<br />
That question is marked as answered by me, because the guy did go to some effort investigating it and i decided to just give up on it.<br />
<br />
But i still would really appreciate an answer from microsoft, because this behaviour is inconsistent with the way we usually&nbsp;expect windows&nbsp;to work and its clearly causing confusion for us users.<br />
<br />
We still dont have a satisfactory explanation&nbsp;for this behaviour. To simply say that we shouldn't be saving files to the c drive root directory is not satisfactory in my opinion. This is behaviour that deserves an explanation because it results in files going
 missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><span>Hi</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This cannot be explained without a brief history of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Back in 2002, Bill Gates announced the
<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/execmail/2002/07-18twc.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Trustworthy Computing Initiative</a>, which was a result of the legendary security vulnerabilities&nbsp;in the Windows operating systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The core of the vulnerability problems was that everyone who used Windows was using an Administrator account which
 gives the user unrestricted access to any part of the system. This made it very easy for a malicious intruder to gain access to the computer through the vulnerable administrator account. Up to this point, most third party developers were not concerned about
 permissions for their products because they could code their programs to also have unrestricted access to any part of the system through the users administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Because of this fact, the Windows developers knew that implementing all of the new security protocols would cause many
 legitimate third party software programs, which were not updated to work with the new security measures, to break. To assist these third party developers, they decided to implement File and Registry Virtualization which would allow these programs to continue
 working. From the beginning, all of the published documentation for file and registry virtualization has stated that this measure is temporary to give third party developers the time to update their products. At some point in the future this virtualization
 will disappear.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When a software program is installed that has not been updated to work properly with Windows Vista or Windows 7, it
 will try to write directly to a secure part of the OS or registry. When this happens, Virtualization will intercept these attempts and redirect the program to an isolated, non-system, user-specific location, such as the C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Virtual
 Store folder. <span>&nbsp;</span>In the Registry, when a program tries to write to a system wide location such as, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software, the write is redirected to the
<br />
<span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\VirtualStore key.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All of these redirects by the system are completely transparent to the application.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
The bottom line is that if an application is&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;virtualization, it is less than compatible with the published best practices for windows software development.<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are some links that should be helpful.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Erik</p>
<p>You cannot download files from&nbsp;the Internet and place them directly in the root of the C: drive or any other System location.</p>
<p>The reasons are that files from the internet are inherently the most dangerous files that you can place on the computer and they are the source of over 90% of all computer infections. The Root of the C: drive is also the worst place that you could possibly
 choose to place these files. If the file turns out to have malicious code, it could infect your entire system from that location.</p>
<p>To prevent this, files downloaded from the internet are assigned a Mandatory Integrity Level of 'Low'. This prevents them from being placed in System locations.</p>
<p>When a file with&nbsp;a Low integrity level is downloaded and you select a System location, it is automatically 'Virtualized' and placed in a more secure location. This function is transparent to the system to prevent error messages.</p>
<p>This function is&nbsp;implemented through the Protected Mode in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>This secure location is in your User Account folders and is called the Virtual Store.</p>
<p>In your second screenshot, look at the &nbsp;<strong>Toolbar</strong>&nbsp; and you will notice a &nbsp;<strong>'Compatibility Button'</strong>&nbsp; has appeared. If you click that button, it will take you to the folder where the downloaded file is located.</p>

<h2>            Encrypted files and folders </h2>
                    I encrypted a folder when I was using Windows XP - I moved the folder to a safe location - before I installed Windows 7. When I try to access any of the files in the folder - I it won't let me says "user does not have access privileges"
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to remove the encryption by: right click&gt;general tab&gt;advance, I am unable to remove the encryption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help in this matter.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi angelofdeath1000,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As you are receiving the error message related to no privileges to access the files this may happen
 if your user account does not have permissions to access those files I would suggest that you try taking ownership of the files and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Taking ownership of files in Windows Vista</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>This will walk you through taking ownership of a file or folder in Windows Vista.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Right-click the affected folder and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click on the
<strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Click on the
<strong>Owner</strong> tab,&nbsp; and then click <strong>Edit</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Select your
<strong>&lt;UserName&gt;</strong>, check <strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong>, and click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>You will receive a notification simply click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click <strong>
OK</strong> three more times, and test to see if the issue is resolved.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can lose access to encrypted files if you install a new operating system or upgrade your current
 one, or if your current operating system fails. The following steps can help you regain access to encrypted files.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You must have a backup copy of your encryption key and related certificate on a disc or other removable
 media (such as a USB flash drive) to follow the steps below. For more information, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-Encrypting-File-System-EFS-certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Back up Encrypting File System (EFS) certificate</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>These steps can't be completed on Windows&nbsp;7 Starter, Windows&nbsp;7 Home Basic, and Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Do one of the following:</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>To recover encrypted files stored on an external hard disk, connect the hard disk to the new computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If your operating system fails and you need to recover encrypted files that are stored on a different partition from your failed operating system, move
 the encrypted files to a computer that is working, or install a functional operating system on the current computer.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Insert the removable media that your certificate and key are saved on.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Open Certificate Manager by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, typing <strong>certmgr.msc</strong> into the search box, and then pressing Enter.‚Äå&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>In the left pane, click
<strong>Personal</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click the <strong>
Action</strong> menu, point to <strong>All Tasks</strong>, and then click <strong>
Import</strong>. This opens the Certificate Import wizard.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click <strong>
Next</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Type the location of the file that contains the certificate, or click
<strong>Browse</strong> and navigate to the file's location, click <strong>Open</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you have navigated to the right location but don't see the certificate you are importing, then,
 in the list next to the <strong>File name</strong> box, click <strong>Personal Information Exchange</strong>.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Type the password, select the
<strong>Mark this key as exportable</strong> check box, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Do not enable strong private key protection.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Click <strong>
Place all certificates in the following store</strong>, confirm that the <strong>
Personal store</strong> is indicated, click <strong>Next</strong>, and then click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>After you import the certificate, you should have access to the encrypted files.</span></span></p>

<p>CPU usage and Memory usage is pretty constant during this time. I've just tested it on rightmove.com in the UK, when using the pull down menu for within xmiles or last 24hrs/3 days etc this is when it hangs. However I can still move mouse or select another
 window ok. I wonder if it is the pop up advert on this site that is the issue or the cookie monster. It also happens on many other web pages.</p>

<br />And also go to defender and do a full virus scan.

<p>I have one of the best commercial AV programmes which is upto date and regularly runs the AV for threats and performance etc. This has not identified any issues. Any further ideas would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
