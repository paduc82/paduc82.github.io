<h2>            Failed upgrade to windows 10, PC stuck in boot cycle.</h2>
                    <p>PC: Samsung Series 5 Ultra</p>
<br />
<p>So I've completely ran aground in trying to fix an issue with windows 10, and it seems to be caused by multiple Win10 "features" that come around and slap me in the face at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue came about when I was trying to upgrade the laptop to windows 10, I left the machine and I came back to the primary issue I'm dealing with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary issue's symptoms are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc boots with the Windows 10 logo showing, then bsods fairly quickly with no information pertaining to a specific error.</p>
"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart, we're just collecting some info..."
<p>
</p><p>The pc then shuts down and restarts, after which it attempts to boot into some sort of recovery mode, as it shows the Windows 10 logo and "Preparing Automatic Repair" underneath it, which fails and bsods in exactly the same manner as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cycle above repeats ad infinitum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now to resolve this should be simple: Boot up from a windows 8 recovery usb and reinstall win8 on the main HD to restore the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot seem to be able to boot from a recovery usb drive, and I can't get into the BIOS to change the boot priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only seeming success I've had is by disconnecting the laptop's main HD, then I can both get into the BIOS and boot from the recovery usb drive.</p>
<p>Though I can't perform any recovery on the actual HD when it's not connected to the computer.</p>
<p>So I change the boot order, save my settings and power down, in order to try to get into recovery with the HD plugged in.</p>
<p>As another note, I disabled fast boot from the BIOS, as I also read online that this could prevent access to the BIOS, this however has made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reconnect the HD, but it appears that having the HD connected completely overrules the boot order, and once again I cannot get into the BIOS or boot from the recovery media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I re-disconnect the HD, and am once again able to get into the BIOS, and the boot order has reverted to default.</p>
<p>For some reason, having the HD plugged in once again places Windows Boot Manager on top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, I can only get into the BIOS while the HD isn't connected in one of two ways:</p>
<p>1) no bootable usb is connected, so BIOS has nowhere to go, I can then get into the BIOS</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; when the bootable USB is connected, I can get to it from the "uefi firmware settings" options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also tried the following piece of advice I found online</p>
<p>-push battery disconnect pin on the bottom of the laptop, then hold power button for 60 seconds to supposedly clear some bios tables. This was supposed to allow me into the BIOS, but I still am unable to get into the BIOS while the HD is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've seen similar issues online resolved in simple ways, but I can't even get to the point of trying any solutions that others have resolved their primary issue (the endless boot cycle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you guys/gals have any suggestions for things to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Some of that sounds pretty helpful, too bad I can't actually get into the operating system.</p>
<p>As I said, I haven't managed to get the pc to boot into windows without it crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still not sure what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, any and all help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- Edit ---</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the end, I ended up plugging the faulty HD into another laptop and then booting from a recovery drive to then wipe and reformat the hard drive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was also able to do massive recovery on all of my files from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a really odd solution for a really odd problem.</p>

<h2>            &#40;URGENT&#41; Problems with switching between windows on Windows 10 64-bit after updating from Windows 8.1 &#40;Follow-up x 3&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have updated my PC from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on 7 Feb. Most things were working fine except a few pretty much annoying features, including<strong>&nbsp;a problem when switching between windows using methods including clicking on taskbar,
 using ALT+Tab and using the Task View.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Phenomenon</span></strong></p>
<p>This happens in various applications including Chrome, Word and Acrobat Reader, Putty, and even Command Prompt. For example, when I am using&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Word 2016</strong>&nbsp;(not limited to this app) and I would like to&nbsp;<strong>switch
 to another window of Chrome</strong>&nbsp;by using the&nbsp;<strong>ALT+Tab shortcut or clicking the icon on the taskbar</strong>, the Chrome window&nbsp;<span>sometimes</span>&nbsp;shows up momentarily, but later it returns to the MS Word window and then the
 Word window goes out of focus. For most of the time now, the window simply stay stuck there without going away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the most recent test, I opened&nbsp;<strong>Chrome and Event Viewer (or any other apps such as Firefox or Word) at the same time</strong>. When I clicked on the Event Viewer icon continuously, it can show up and hide as normal. However,
 when I did the same to the Chrome icon, the&nbsp;<strong>Chrome window ALWAYS hides under the other windows (when the issue occurs).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I clicked the "Show desktop" button, some apps (e.g. Event Viewer in this case) stayed there. Sometimes I was able to "force" the desktop to be showed but when I clicked to open Chrome again, the Event Viewer app also showed up in the
 back at the same time. I am also unable to hide the Chrome window just by clicking on the Chrome window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem is away for a while but it appears again after a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION BSOD.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For the most recent case, I found that Chrome is covering the other applications in an alternative manner (which seems that Microsoft is trying to f**king play the a## out of me?). What I mean is when I open Chrome and click on another app
 (e.g. FileZilla) repeatedly, it get covered in the (2n+1)th click and appears in the (2n)th click (n is an integer).</strong></p>
<p>

<p>This issue was resolved for a few days before it reappeared today. Is there any methods to deal with the issue? Hopefully I don't need to pay for the telephone support of Windows, nor reinstalling the Windows 10 OS (which means that the act of forcing
 update in Win7 and Win8.x by Microsoft is equal to raping the computers and giving out bugs). I also do not prefer creating a totally new account and resetting everything (which is too time-consuming) nor putting my machine in clean boot every time I use it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Harry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize that you are facing multiple issue in Windows 10, we appreciate for the time and effort you have spent so far in troubleshooting the issue, let me assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might happen due to the outdated or corrupted drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the information I read in the laptop manufacturer’s website, I found that few drivers must be updated before upgrading to Windows 10 and few drivers should be updated after upgrading to Windows
 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Before we proceed with the next set of troubleshooting, kindly let us know how you upgrade the system to Windows 10, is it through windows upgrade or through the Media creation tool?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the manufacturer’s website, it is clearly mentioned that most of the drivers update through windows update itself but few drivers and utilities should be updated before and few after upgrading
 to Windows 10. </span></p>
<p><span>For more information about the drivers update before and after upgrading to Windows 10, refer to the below link and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>NOTE: Select the exact model of your system in the above link.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Kindly write back to us with the updated status of the issue for further assistance on Windows. We will be happy to assist you.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thanks, I remember that I just upgraded by Windows Update and I wasn't aware about the driver issue. I tried to reinstall as suggested in Fujitsu (steps before upgrade) and the installations mostly failed.

<h2>            Removed windows 10 and laptop is kaput</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded windows 10 over night and after that the mouse pad on my laptop didn't work property , making my laptop unusable. So I removed windows 10, restoring my laptop back to windows 8, and since then it's stuck on a reboot loop telling me 'your PC
 ran into a problem' and tries to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now keeps going to the 'automatic repair' screen and I have tried all options available to fix it - currently I can't use my laptop which means I can't work. Any advice welcomed&nbsp;</p>

<div>Trying to start the Print Spooler Service you see a message like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could not start the Print Spooler service on Local Computer.</div>
<div>Error 2: &nbsp;The system cannot find the file specified.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you look at the Print Spooler Service in the Services applet, it shows the Print Spooler Service set to Automatic, but it is&nbsp;not running and will not start.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you look in the Event Viewer System log you will see a message similar to this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Event Type:<span> </span>Error</div>
<div>Event Source:<span> </span>Service Control Manager</div>
<div>Event Category:<span> </span>None</div>
<div>Event ID:<span> </span>7000</div>
<div>Description:</div>
<div>The Print Spooler service failed to start due to the following error:&nbsp;</div>
<div>The system cannot find the file specified.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>An Error 2 means that the specified file could not be found. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the case of the Print Spooler Service, the "specified file" is most likely file to be missing is:</div>
<div><br />
<div>c:\windows\system32\spoolsv.exe</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running sfc /scannow will not help you. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could "try" running sfc /scannow, but it will not replace any missing or corrupted system files since that is not&nbsp;what sfc /scannow is supposed to do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Somehow you must manually replace the missing or suspicious file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There should be backup copies of the missing file in other places on your hard disk. &nbsp;When you find a copy of the missing file, just copy it and&nbsp;paste it into the c:\windows\system32 folder where it belongs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When copying the file, respond in the affirmative if asked to replace or overwrite the existing file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The most likely places to look for backup copies of missing system files are:</div>
<div><br />
<div>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</div>
<div>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you can't find the file there, search your hard drive(s) and see if you can find a copy. &nbsp;You could also copy the missing file from a&nbsp;working system using a floppy or USB device, email the file to yourself etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Deleting the spoolsv.exe file manually would require some extra effort since it is one of the 3498 files that Windows XP automatically looks after. &nbsp;Windows File Protection should automatically replace any monitored file quickly and silently if it ever
 disappears.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Replacing the file may provide immediate relief for the symptom of the problem but does not actually fix the real problem... which is how did&nbsp;the file ever come up missing in the first place? &nbsp;It is important to fix the actual problem and not just treat
 the symptom of the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Possibilities are some malicious software has afflicted your system or your antivirus or antimalware programs thought the file was infected&nbsp;(maybe is really was) and quarantined/deleted the file.</div>

<h2>            Disk usage 100&#37; most of the time</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 7000 2 in 1, with a solid state hybrid drive Seagate 500LM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been really frustrating using Windows 10 with it, since it´s extremely slow most of the times, with the hard disk showing 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching it over the web, and many dell laptop users have been facing the same problem, where Intel and Microsoft keep throwing the problem to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up about people telling it could be the driver managing the disk in windows 10.
</p>
<p>I tried installing the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver, but it says the platform is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, haven´t solved it, and hope to get some solutions from you.</p>
<p>Let me know what I can do to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<div>Still no hope.</div>
<div>Already done all common solutions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Disabled prefetch (both Service and in regedit)</div>
<div>2) Disabled MSI support of the Standard SATA AHCI controller</div>

<div>I had even reinstalled windows 10 from scratch, using the Media Tool, a couple months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 Live Tile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scooter63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Live Tile</h2>
                    It would seem to me that I should be able to have my Outlook email and my Outlook calendar display in the live tiles on the Windows 8.1 start screen but to date it doesn't seem possible. Surely someone has already solved this issue. Can you give me some
 direction on how to go about this? Outlook and Windows are both 1microsoft products so it should be easy. Right?<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Today I installed the Hauppauge 'WinTV7' application in order to get more information on some clear QAM channels missing from Media Center.<br />
After configuring my missing channels, I played a known good .mkv file (I had just watched the video last night using Media Center, but didn't catch the ending.), low and behold, my audio stopped at the :30 mark!<br />
<br />
Tried to play the file with WinTV7 and it played fine, good audio throughout.<br />
<br />
Uninstalled WinTV7 the .mkv file(s) play fine with Media Center/Media Player.<br />
<br />
Going to post this problem to Hauppauge for a response...<br />

    <title>Bit Locker Driver error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristib1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bit Locker Driver error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an "upgraded" windows 10 Home version, from windows 8.1 laptop. A few months ago I did a clean install due to the system getting hung up &amp; it wasn't long until I got the BSOD. When I was trying various recovery options I got the "\Device\Harddisk0\DR0
 has a bad block" error. So, with the help of a forum we worked through it &amp; the clean install was completed &amp; things were going ok.... were.... now it is getting progressively worse again. Did I not check the event viewer the first time this happened, before
 the clean install? I've got'a say "yes" because it would confirm that the exact same thing is happening again &amp; now I cannot be 100% sure of this, only 99.9%.&nbsp;<br />
So what is happening is the system errors are alternating between "\Device\Harddisk0\DR0 has a bad block" event ID 7 &amp; volume information on&nbsp;<span>\\?\Volume{a86ec0fd-4dc6-4ae9-85e4-a2683ef453be} cannot be read, error code -&nbsp;</span>0xc000009c,&nbsp; event ID - 26420.</p>
<p>Did chkdsk /f /r /x</p>
<p>Actually got a clean bill of health</p>
<p>As you can see, disk management gives all the partitions clean bills of health.</p>
<p>Virus scans come up empty.</p>
<p>So, please advise on how to assign a letter to these drives, so maybe, hopefully, bit-locker will leave them alone. I cannot do this through disk management by right clicking on the volume. Any idea why? I can access c:, however it obviously has a letter,
 so no need. Is this another of microsoft's ways to protect me from myself? Cuz it's really irritating that what might be the one solution I can find is one I cannot do on my own computer.</p>
<p>I don't/can't even use bit-locker anyway. I mean I guess I can use it to read encrypted stuff, however I don't, so why the heck it's even active, I don't know. &amp; I can't use it for anything else cuz I have Home edition. &amp; I have had Windows 10 for a couple/few
 years now &amp; while I have had many other problems, this has not been one, so ???? what gives????</p>
<p>Very frustrated. Linux is looking better &amp; better everyday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you - Kristi</p>

            Hello Kristi, <br />
<br />
Most of the BitLocker Group Policy settings are applied when BitLocker is initially turned on for a drive. If a computer is not compliant with existing Group Policy settings, BitLocker may not be turned on or modified until the computer is in a compliant state.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If multiple changes are necessary to bring the drive into compliance, you must suspend BitLocker protection, make the necessary changes, and then resume protection.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That being said, the issue that you are facing is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Community. I suggest posting your question in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet Forums</a>, where we have support professionals who are well-equipped with the knowledge on such issues.

We appreciate you working with us throughout this issue you're experiencing.<br />

<p>Being that it is Home Edition there is no Group Policy Manager, so again, very perplexing. However I did think that getting help with assigning a drive letter was something I could get via this route. I will look into what you suggested or another forum.
 Thank you....</p>

                    <p>I get the following error when trying to run system restore:</p>

<p>rstui.exe – Bad Image</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\VSSAPI.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media

<p>I also get similar errors when trying to open the add/remove software tool, backup tool, and add wireless connection tool. How can I fix this problem?</p>

            Here is an alternative method to run System Restore:<br />
<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Repair PC" from the menu.<br />
5. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
6. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
7. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
8. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

            Sorry, it's like changing a car tyre: If you have a car jack then you can do it yourself. If you don't then you need to get the car serviced. It used to be possible to download the Repair CD but Microsoft appear to have plugged this hole. Your best bet
 is to get one from a friend. It takes only a couple of minutes to burn it but is absolutely essential if you wish to do your own maintenance.<br />

<h2>            Profile sign in by itself</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, why does my profile sign in by itself? I have 3 profile accounts&nbsp;on my&nbsp;Xbox 360 and my main one sign in by&nbsp;itself basically every day, at least everytime I check, usually about 6-7 pm. It's very annoying especially when I get messages from a mate,
 he&nbsp;thinks I have been on&nbsp;and&nbsp;just ignored&nbsp;his&nbsp;message when I havn't been online at all.&nbsp;What is the problem here, does anyone know?</p>

<p>No no, hmm let me try to explain again.</p>
<p>Scenario: I have not been on the 360 all day, nor on Xbox.com. When I start the 360 in the evening I log in on another profile where I have my main profile Liasos as a friend. When I check Liasos profile It says "last online 2 hours ago".</p>
<p>It's like someone else log in on my profile, I don't understand it.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,
<br />
<br />
I believe the backup task that you have got corrupted somehow and is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you try the following:
<br />
1. Go to task scheduler (run taskschd.msc from RUN dialog OR from a command-prompt)
<br />
2. Navigate under Task Scheduler Library-&gt;Microsoft-&gt;Windows-&gt;WindowsBackup folder<br />
3. Delete AutomaticBackup task<br />
4. Delete Windows Backup Monitor task<br />
5. Try to re-configure file backup</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In case you do not find these tasks in task scheduler UI, suggest doing the following:
<br />
1. Open an elevated command-prompt<br />
2. cd %windir%\system32\tasks\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsBackup<br />
3. del AutomaticBackup<br />
4. del "Windows Backup Monitor"<br />
5. Try to re-configure file backup</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if either of these workarounds was helpful.</span></span></p>
<span><br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am getting this error message, when I open up TASK SCHEDULER</p>
<p>The Task Image is corrupted, or has been tampered with.</p>
<p>I have read this formula, in one of the forums and that is.</p>
<p>That I&nbsp;go into regedit, and follow this tree.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CURRENTVERSION\SCHEDULE\TASKS\SYSTEMRESTORE\SR</p>
<p>I SHOULD DELETE THAT TASK, AND THAT WILL RECTIFY THE ERROR.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me if that works, and if I do delete that task how do I re-create it again?</p>
<p>I am very afraid of messing about in REGEDIT.</p>
<p>What will happen to the restore points, that I have?</p>
<p>Do I delete them as well and start again, if so how do I delete them?</p>
<p>To be honest I don't know if the current restore points, work anyway.</p>
<p>If I do get problems&nbsp;in thge future, I would like them to fall back on.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the. help</p>

<h2>            Search results in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have two partitions - C: and D:. In indexing options C: drive is default and I added to indexing my music folder from D: drive. When indexing completed, I was trying search my music, but Search does not show results from D: drive before I click Search
 My Stuff. For example - I have document scheme.docx on C: drive. When I start typing scheme.do.. search is showing result for this document immediately. I have song Jason Derulo - Want to Want Me on D: drive Music folder, which i was added to indexing option.
 When I start typing want to want.. search don't show any results. When I click Search My Stuff, my searched song is showing. Is it possible to search for files immediately on second drive without clicking Search My Stuff? I was using this feature on Windows
 8.1 search at charms bar, it was worked without problems and I loved it, so I really want it to Windows 10 too. :)</p>
<p>sorry for my bad English.</p>

<p>Says driver is latest version and nothing newer available</p>
<p>Creative confirms this.</p>
<p>This problem has happened before with earlier Win10 upgrades but driver updates have solved the problem within a few days.</p>
<p>I like this sound system so prefer not to replace it.</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Had this problem on an RCA Cambio 10.1 Tablet (101v2). After trying every suggestion I could find on the internet and spending a lot of hours, I finally got the sound back by installing the Intel Atom 3000 series chipset. This put back the missing Audio
 Intel (SST) speaker device and Realtek in the Sound, video and game controllers.

            If you type the word "Dell" into your Start menu, it should find the program. &nbsp;However, if you don't mind, can I suggest that you might instead prefer to simply use the Windows Taskbar instead? &nbsp;Just like the Dell Dock, you can drag any icon you want on
 to it. &nbsp;It also gives you these benefits over the Dell Dock:
<ol>
<li>Less screen clutter -- there's only one toolbar to look for for all your icons.</li><li>The icon is always in the same place, whether the program is already running or not.&nbsp;</li><li>Many programs, such as mail or messaging programs, will put overlay status icons on top of the Taskbar icon to alert you when a new message arrives.&nbsp;</li><li>You can drag-and-drop the icons into any order you like.&nbsp; </li><li>When you point to an icon of a program that is already running, you get a preview before you even click it.&nbsp;</li><li>You can right-click any icon for a list of recently-used files that program has been used with.&nbsp;</li><li>You can use a keyboard shortcut to open any icon. For example, Windows-3 opens the 3rd icon on the Taskbar.&nbsp;</li><li>If you want it on the top of the screen, just right-click it, unlock it, then drag it to where you like.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>It truly is "one icon to rule them all", and allows you to use the same single point for launching, viewing, opening, and controlling -- all from one point, and without the clutter of yet-another-toolbar to take up your space.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And if you don't like it, you can always use the Dell Dock as before. &nbsp;The choice is yours.</div>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are unable to see <b>any</b> <b>Wireless networks</b> means that either
<b>Wireless switch is turned off</b> or the <b>Wireless drivers</b> are faulty on the computer.<br />
Normally, you should be able to see other <b>wireless networks</b> apart from yours if the
<b>Wireless switch</b> is <b>on</b>.<br />
The <b>Wireless switch</b> looks like a <b>stick with waves around it.</b><br />
Check if the <b>Wireless</b> <b>switch</b> is <b>on</b>.</span></p>

You may download the “<b>Wireless LAN</b>” drivers from the link mentioned below –<br />

<p>Hey there Robin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue preventing you from uninstalling the game.
</p>
<p>I split your post from it's older thread so that we could make sure to give your situation appropriate attention.
</p>
<p>If you haven't yet, I would try what we call a soft reset of your console. <span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Also make sure that you select the option denoted
<strong>reset and keep my games and apps.&nbsp;</strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ok so my windows 10 pc has been giving me an issue where it would freeze up and become useless after waking up from screen being off (i had set the computer to never go to sleep but it still went to sleep after a period of time) and i would only be able
 to get out of it by restarting. And at first it only got stuck at this screen (pic) only a few times after the reboot but niw it is stuck at this screen and it is absolutely useless, all i can do with it is change keyboard, have accessability options, see
 network connections, and have power options (the 4 buttons on the bottom of the screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get my PC back up and running ASAP, thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a custom built PC.</p>
<p>If you need any further information on the PC please ask.</p>

<p>- If you have not been to the support page on the monitor mfg's site you may want to post there as well, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are all games that have an option for 3440x1440 in the&nbsp; games setup running only in 2560x1440,
</p>
<p>or just&nbsp; this one ? </p>
<p>- Have you verified it's not something to do with the SLI scaling ( which Nvidia model, btw ) ?</p>
<p>- When using a monitor with this high resolution, would having DSR enabled&nbsp; conflict ?</p>
<p>- Or, it may have to do with refresh rates. Some monitors only display the highest res at lower refresh rates (30Hz),</p>
<p>but I thought this only applied to the TV's some people use as a monitor.</p>

<h2>            Spatial sound not working despite being selected</h2>
                    <p>Neither Dolby Atmos for Headphones nor Windows Sonic is working, circa 1/11/18.&nbsp; Despite being able to enable both and successfully checking "turn on virtual 7.1," there is no virtualization effect at all; the sound is precisely the same as "off."&nbsp; This
 is common to all devices I have on hand, and not to a particular pair of headphones.&nbsp; I have installed and reinstalled drivers to no avail; still no joy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have all updates up to date and am using the latest public release of Windows 10 (Fall Creator's,
 I presume); to my recollection, the virtualization effect worked prior to updating to Fall Creator's. Please do not respond with generalized nonsense (e.g. "reinstall Windows").&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

Hello Bluejeans7, You probably already got your&nbsp;issue sorted already, but just incase you didn't this should fix it.&nbsp; I've had the same issue as you, with my 2016 Dell Insiron&nbsp;Laptop with windows 10, so someone told me about the drivers from Realtek, after
 I downloaded/installed the drivers I know have the option for speakers or headphones in the Playback devices tab.&nbsp; Before I downloaded the drivers I only had the speakers/headphones in the description, now I have a seperate&nbsp;one for the laptop speakers and
 for the 3.5mm headphones, which now I can highlight Dolby Atmos for headphones and check the 7.1<br />

    <title>Why would resetting a Surface Pro 2 from USB fail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why would resetting a Surface Pro 2 from USB fail&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 2 that I want to reset to factory defaults, wiping all data. &nbsp;Microsoft sent me a recovery USB drive (very awesome of them). &nbsp;However, when I go through the standard steps listed on their site (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-refresh-or-reset-surface-pro#usb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset
 from USB recovery media</a>) the reset process starts then fails (at about 13% of the way through if I choose "Just remove my files" and at about 75% if I choose "Fully clean the drive"). &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas what might cause it to fail at that point? &nbsp;Of
 course my tablet no longer boots into Windows since the drive was formatted by the reset process. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated!

            <p>Barb, I decided to create my own Windows 8.1 installation USB drive and try installing using that.&nbsp; It worked, so my Surface is all set at this time, and I am guessing something was wrong with the USB recovery drive.&nbsp; Maybe that will be helpful for future
 inquiries.&nbsp; Thanks for your input.</p>
