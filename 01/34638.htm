<p>Thanks for your reply. Before you replied, I tried the update again and received an error code.
<strong>So I decided to skip your steps, for the time being,</strong> as I think this error code may give you the info you need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update I am trying to perform is to reinstall Windows 10 in the latest version, as directed by Microsoft on my PC, so it can take security updates going forward. The error code I receive is 0xc1990208.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Virtual Assistant looks up that error code and shows it only with a further suffix,
</p>
<p>as 0xc1990208-0x4000c. It says this points to an incompatible installation or program on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I find this program?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as to this or whatever you think I need to do. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. The error code can be associated to issues with the Windows Update components on your device. The link that we've shared about finding and fixing Windows Update errors normally resolves these types of issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're currently working on a known issue for a particular update (KB4056892) which fails on some devices. In line with this, the steps that we've provided in checking the Update history will show which KB # is failing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I am unfortuantely too busy at present to follow your recommended steps, and will do so at my earliest opportunity. In the meantime, is there a way I can stop the repeated attempts to update my system, which have been occuring three
 times per day since Januarty 19? Update History shows the message over and over again: "Feature Update to Windows 10, Version 1709. Failed to Install on [date]." This appears three times per day between 1/19/2018 and today. I would like to save the processer
 time, energy and slowdowns which occur as I work on other things, expended on this useless task, which takes 2 hours or more to run each time. Can you please tell me what item(s) to turn off in Task Manager. There are several items there I am tempted to turn
 off. It dowsn't seem to run as a foreground task, but in the background, but I'm not sure which one. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>wushowhide.diagcab&nbsp; to block Version 1709 update.&nbsp; It is a Microsoft program that seems to be the current recommendation although I remember from two years ago it eventually failed in blocking the update that was nailing me.&nbsp; As with standard Microsoft update
 attempts, they eventually fixed the update by replacing it.&nbsp; If you look for Common Issues with Version 1709, Microsoft lists a number of known bugs with my favorite words, "will be fixed in a future update".&nbsp; Hopefully it will occur in my lifetime which is
 normally the case.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result in a corrupted system file. A third-party
 program conflict can also be the reason for this error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us narrow down the possibilities why your PC encountered this issue. You can follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Temporarily disable your antivirus program before running the Windows Update.
</span></li><li><span>Visit the article on </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">how to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></a><span>.
 This helps eliminate software conflict that occurs when you install a program or an update. You may also determine what conflict is causing the issue by performing this method.</span></li><li><span>Fix Windows Update errors. Since you are using Windows 10, you can do this by running the Windows Update Troubleshooter. To download the Windows Update Troubleshooter, click on this

</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: After doing the steps above, you can enable your antivirus program again.</span></p>

<h3> 23mike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - UAC code &#40;&#63;&#41; being set to &#39;disabled&#39; for almost everything</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and run a relatively few applications, mostly MS Office.</p>
<p>My PC was purchased new about 6 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the last few days I am unable to start almost any application without it being suspended (UAC code apparently set to 'Disabled').</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and start Outlook I get a message explaining that there's been a problem, no error code, but&nbsp; option boxes... to "Repair now" or "Cancel".</p>
<p>I select "Repair now" and it appears to run ok.</p>
<p>I say '<em>appears</em>' because almost every application has the UAC code flagged as 'disabled' (my info is from/via Task Manager).</p>
<p>Looking at the Task Manager Details list option there appear to be multiple versions of a number of system files, like 'svchost', that have been started and then suspended....</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know all significant updates have been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions/explanations would be very welcome!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community - let's start by finding out if you can print to another option using a different printer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have these two options available to select - are you able to successfully print using either the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" or "Send to OneNote" Printer options or does Word still freeze?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you also mind sharing the make and model of your printer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Unfortunately I can't even get to the point of choosing a printer. &nbsp;As soon as I click on "Print" the program freezes and that's it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, it now appears that Word 2010 freezes when you click on anything in the ribbon bar at the top. &nbsp;Don't think it can cope with the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the additional detail - I understand that it sounds like you are having general Word 2010 performance issues now and it's once you select "Print" that freezing starts so that you cannot get to the point to access a different printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a way to continue to troubleshoot - is it possible for you to save this file to your OneDrive and open via&nbsp;Word Online in Office Web Apps&nbsp;and choose the option to Print from there?&nbsp; It doesn't sound like this is a specific document issue since you mentioned
 in your first post that you could work with other documents, so this might help determine if it's an issue with a printer driver or Word 2010 itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access Word Online via Office WebApps: <a href="http://office.com/webapps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.com/webapps</a> or you can click on the Word document once it's uploaded to OneDrive (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/</a>) and it will open automatically into Word Online. The option to print
 should be in the top ribbon and there should be a pop-up to select your desired printer.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you'd like to continue to try to resolve in Windows 10 and if you have confirmed that printing still works from another program (or another version of Word, like Word Online
 previous suggested in the thread), it seems less likely the issue is related to the printer or printer driver.</span></p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem with Word 2013. &nbsp;Since upgrading from W7Pro 64bit, whenever I open or create a document in word and hit FILE &gt; PRINT, Word freezes. &nbsp;The same thing also happens if I try to save the document as a PDF. &nbsp;As soon as I hit SAVE,
 Word freezes and is NOT RESPONDING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing happens in Excel 2013 and Notepad so I'm guessing this is a print problem in W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also point out that Word 2013 crashes a lot since upgrading the OS. &nbsp;It seems like this usually happens when saving too, it will freeze and for some reason whilst frozen takes away my ability to copy/paste in other apps until I force close the frozen
 Word 2013 app, then the copy/paste function returns...</p>

<h2>            extra characters come up when i press a key after spilling soda on the keyboard</h2>
                    Keyboard Problem. I am working on a Windows7 Toshiba laptop. Someone spilt soda on it. I clean up the keyboard but it still would not use all the keys. I got a differant keyboard off a parts laptop and it will type random letters and number, (Press the
 k key and you get "8k", Press the l key and you ket "l9") If i plug in a usb keyboard it works fine. Is it possible the spill shorted the motherboard connection to the keyboard?

            <p>Is the replacement keyboard from the same model Toshiba? If so, and you're still getting errors, then the circuitry is probably fried internally. While you had the old keyboard out, did you check for liquid inside the laptop?<br />If you think it may be the keyboard (and I'm betting it is), then do a search online for the part number. It's probably on a sticker on the back of it, or on the ribbon cable connector. Amazon usually has a good selection of laptop parts available for reasonable prices (I got a replacement 17" LCD screen for an HP laptop for $89, and it works great).</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

</p><p>I too unfortunately suffer problems. Running the troubleshooter with the given file prompts me to restart (which I than did for the n-th time). After doing that however the update still hasn't installed and the troubleshooter now states:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- Issue with Camera, Bluetooth, Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Windows10. These are a few issues I am encountering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) <strong>Camera</strong>- When I click a picture with Windows Store Camera app(the default camera app i guess), it gives an error "<strong>Something went wrong-0x200F424F</strong>" and does not save pictures in Camera Roll folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)<strong>Bluetooth</strong>- I wanted to transfer pictures from my windows phone8.1 to my laptop(win10) using bluetooth. But it gives an error "<strong>The device you're trying to send to doesn't support sharing over bluetooth</strong>".</p>
<p>I could easily get this task done without any problems or errors when i had windows8.1 on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>- When i try to make a Web Note and save it using One Note, It gives an error "<strong>Something went wrong-0x80070005".</strong></p>
<p><br />
Can anyone help please????? I love windows10 but these few issues are a pain.........</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience on Windows 10!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<h2>            skype blocking</h2>
                    <p>Hi good day,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this gets asked frequently, however&nbsp; I could not find a clear answer.</p>
<p>How could a person tell if they are blocked on skype?</p>
<p>Would they still be able to see profile picture?</p>
<p>Does last active still show when last online/active?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another interesting thing.... when online yesterday skype shows active as 1 day ago, and then 2 days ago will show as active 2 days ago.... after how many days does skype show status as "days ago without saying for example 4 days ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can determine if a person has blocked you if that user no longer receives your chat messages or contact request. You may still be able to see the profile picture, but that user will not be able to receive any messages from you and you will no longer
 be in that user's contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the status, it may display blank if the contact has not logged in for a long time.</p>

<h2>            Help&#58;  Can&#39;t Tag Camera Pictures &#40;Windows 10&#41; or cut&#47;copy pictures en-mass when downloading from camera</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi Everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am completely stuck. &nbsp;I don't do much with pictures but I have a digital camera and in the past when I plugged in my camera to the computer port a tag would come up that I could name whatever I liked and then the pictures were downloaded in total
 from my camera I could cut and paste them all into a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, when I download pictures I don't know exactly what is happening. &nbsp;First off, I don't get any chance to tag the download. &nbsp;The pictures are then downloaded to something called collection and organized I guess by date. (The dates are all wrong too.)
 &nbsp;I also can't seem to copy them all, but have to copy each picture one by one. &nbsp;I don't really understand this new system at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How can I get all the pictures to download together (not sort out by date) with a tag that I can then cut/copy into a folder. &nbsp;I take pictures when travelling so I don't sort them by date but by trip. &nbsp;(Chicago Trip October 2015 for example.) &nbsp;I really
 need help figuring this out. &nbsp;I guess I could copy each individual picture and then put them in a new folder but this seems very labor intensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for any assistance you can give.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I have seen that page and what the page describes is not what is happening to me when I download pictures from my camera. &nbsp;The autoplay import pictures and video does not pop up and there is no pop up to allow me to tag the pictures before
 beginning the import. &nbsp;That is what happened in windows 7 and what I would like to happen. &nbsp;That is not what is happening on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What is happening is the import starts without allowing an option to tag the photos. &nbsp;It then downloads them to something called photos "collection". &nbsp;And then it sorts them out by date which is odd since I do not put a date on the photos and the dates assigned
 by the computer are wrong dates. &nbsp;(The dates given to the pictures I took yesterday was May 2015 for example.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to tag the pictures like I was doing in Windows 7. &nbsp;I am completely confused by the new way photos are being handled and really need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any more advice from anyone.</p>

            I was having the same issue. Loved using windows live photo gallery to tag and rate my photos in Windows 7 so I downloaded Windows Essentials 2012 today which includes live photo gallery. I had trouble finding information online to determine if it would
 be compatible with Windows 10 but decided to give it a try anyway. Seems to work just fine with Windows 10 and I am able to rate and tag pictures again. Hope this helps!

                    I want to transfer all my contacts and messages from Windows Mail running on Vista to my new desktop running on Windows 8. It must support POP3 as my IP is AT&amp;T. I have heard that Outlook 2013 is not very good so I am looking for a simple program that
 need only support one email account. What do you recommend?

There are 2 options.&nbsp; Web mail (which I dont recommend) and an email client.&nbsp; My recommendation for that is windows live mail.&nbsp; It is free, uses little resources, is easy to use and functions similarly to windows mail in&nbsp; vista.
<br />
<br />
Plus you can import all of your data from windows mail.<br />

            Windows Live Mail will install and function just fine on Windows 8/8.1.<br />
I second the recommendation given the fact you have been using Windows Mail all this time.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you want to make it official that it is supported under Windows 8...<br />

Gears of War 3 to Feature Avatar Awards
Doo-Rag, Shirts, and Mask
<p>Written by <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/litepink.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">litepink</a> yesterday at 22:00

<div>Epic's upcoming Xbox 360 exclusive <i>Gears of War 3</i> is set to feature some swag for your avatar. As unearthed in this
<a href="http://avatarawards.ninjasfate.com/retail/gears-of-war-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog post</a>, you'll be able to earn Marcus' patented Doo-Rag, a Horde Shirt, and a Locust Drone Mask for completing certain achievements.

While there are plenty of paid avatar items to purchase off the marketplace, at least a few avatar items will be included in-game, so long as you earn them. It should be noted that with a few exceptions, retail games typically feature ten total awards (unisex
 props and items count as two), so this list might be incomplete. Stay tuned to TrueAchievements as always for any updates.<br />

</p><p>For the past week I have been having problems with internet pages being very slow to load, having to be constantly refreshed to display the content and often not displaying the content at all despite repeated attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had my telephone line and broadband checked by my provider and I am told there is not an issue and it is possibly a Windows 10 issue following the latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there

<br />
<br />D.  I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Skype credit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendysifton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype credit</h2>
                    <p>I had $11 skype credit and Skype said during a call - I had no funds and asked if I wanted to top up. &nbsp; I said yes.&nbsp; Then found I was already&nbsp; $11 in credit as I thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't seem to be able to use the $11 credit although Skype shows I have it. &nbsp; It's almost like Skype thinks it is another account - although it is not. Same sign in - same password. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thoughts ? &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue!
<br />
<br />Your computer may still play a sound for new messages even though you've turned notifications off in Skype. To stop your computer from playing a sound when you get a new Skype message, select Settings &gt; Notifications, and then toggle Notification sounds off or on.
<br />
<br />Please check this official skype link:

                    When I write a new email I have to change the font to one that I prefer. For some reason this will not stay as the one I have chosen. Is there some "special" way I have to do this to "lock in" the font I require. Please speak in laymans English when you
 reply I am an old codger.

            Unfortunately the person who responded was unable to understand my problem. The reply posted wasn't useful in as much that the advice was relating to Windows 8.1 and not Windows 10 and also I am able to change the font but I cannot find out how to "Lock
 It" so that it doesn't change back when you write a new mail. Maybe this makes my problem clearer. Sorry but I messed up the last reply.

            If you are using win 10 mail app (you never said), the short answer is you cannot change the default font and lock it there.

<p>Well looks like that makes two of us with same problem....What the heck???&nbsp; I too get so frustrated with "non answers" from what are suppose to be professionals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And your thread title was completely clear....</p>
<p>Me,&nbsp; and old codger also....Old but not stupid.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I waited til last minute to get the free upgrade,&nbsp; as felt I was being forced to....thinking most of bugs have been worked out...Apparently not , if a person cannot even lock in the font settings.....That makes no sense to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you let me know if you find out anything on this subject</p>
<p>thanks</p>

    <title>How do I turn my touchpad back on in Windows 10 after turning it off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christinakelbel  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn my touchpad back on in Windows 10 after turning it off in the settings menu&#63;</h2>
                    I was playing with the settings on my touchpad and I clicked to turn off my touchpad and now I cannot figure out how to get it back on. I have an Acer laptop and recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. I tried holding the Fn and F7 keys down and
 that shows the icon for a second saying it's on or off but does not turn it back on, I am assuming its because I did not turn it off that way. Please help!

    <title>Store not starting, wsreset.exe gives &#34;app not started&#34;, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin_schmidt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Store not starting, wsreset.exe gives &#34;app not started&#34;, Process Monitor detects BUFFER OVERFLOWS</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
since a couple of months I'm using Windows 8.1 (clean install). At first everything worked fine, in the process of setup - I think after installing some Windows Updates and maybe MS Office and Adobe CS5 - the metro apps stopped to work. Splash screen is showing,
 apps not loading. The error message, if any is shown, is "App wurde nicht gestartet" should translate to "app was not started". That happens for every system metro app, including the store.<br />
Actually I had other work to do and full of hope I waited for an solution to this known (?) problem via a Windows Update. Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Today I found the time to check for new information an tried to get the store running again. Nothing worked.<br />
Clean Boot -&gt; no change<br />
WSreset.exe -&gt; error message: <br />
sfc.exe /scannow -&gt; everything fine<br />
App Troubleshooter -&gt; display driver maybe out of date (yeah right, after downloading and installing the newest one)<br />
Re-register the store in the registry -&gt; no change<br />
<br />
Running TN Process Monitor (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx) and filtering for WSReset.exe seeing a bunch of BUFFER OVERFLOWS as result. Don't know if that is a problem, at least it sounds not that good to me. Mostly registry keys
 were read or requested giving this result. Care for transcript? Will be glad to send it and help getting rid of this problem - without doing a fresh install of Windows 8.1 which could result in a install of Windows 7 and other operating systems.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
<br />
Martin<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
both account types were tested.<br />
Error Message of WSReset.exe is: ms-windows-store:PurgeChaches Die App wurde nicht gestartet<br />
should translate to something like: ms-windows-store:PurgeChaches App was not started<br />
<br />
Reverted back to local account and then again to microsoft account: problem persists<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<p>Not likely it just means that you had some strings which were longer than ProcMon wants to show you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A more interesting&nbsp;filter IMO would be to use&nbsp; Operation Is WriteFile&nbsp; to see if there were any diagnostics being written by that program.</p>

<p>Also, have you tried the Powershell workaround that others are considering a good answer to this symptom?...</p>

<h2>            Getting Verizon.net email in the Microsoft Mail App</h2>
                    The Microsoft email on my new laptop can send e-mail but doesn't receive e-mail.&nbsp; E-mail sent to the Verizon.net address makes it to my Verizon phone but does not make it to my laptop's mail inbox which uses the same e-mail address.&nbsp; Any ideas why e-mail
 makes it to the phone but not the laptop?&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Ran the Apps Troubleshooter and tried sending a message from the Microsoft e-mail app to myself at the same e-mail address.&nbsp; The message was sent and received on my I-phone but did not reach the same Verizon.net account in the laptop Microsoft e-mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So same status as my 1st message.</p>

            <p>Hi Keri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know if you have tried the steps provided by
<strong>Anannya Podder</strong> in her response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried the steps in the previous response, then I would suggest you to try the steps and reply with the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried and still you are facing the issue, then I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in new user account, then proceed with
<strong>Steps 2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong>Create a new Microsoft Account.<br />
<strong><span>Create a user account:</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the new user profile works properly, then copy and paste the data files to the new user profile.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps below to copy the files from the old Microsoft account to the new Microsoft account:
<br />
</span>a) Press/tap <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows
</span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">x</span></strong> together and select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Explorer</span></strong>.<br />
b) Click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View
</span></strong>tab and click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Options</span></strong> at the top right corner.<br />
c) Click/tap the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View</span></strong> tab, and then click/tap
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Show hidden files</span></strong>, folders, and drives.<br />
d) Uncheck the box which states <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hide protected operating system files</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes
</span></strong>to confirm, and then click<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong>.
<br />
f) Locate the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\Old_Username folder</span></strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile
 you want to copy files from.<br />
g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:<br />
•<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ntuser.dat</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.dat.log</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>h) Right click/tap and Select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy</span></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 3</span></strong>: If the new user profile is working fine, then delete the old user.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to delete the corrupted user account profile:<br />
</span>a) Login to your new User Profile.<br />
b) Click/tap on the “<strong>Windows logo</strong>” and type “<strong>User Accounts</strong>”.<br />
c) Now, select “<strong>Settings</strong>” and then select the “<strong>User Accounts</strong>” icon.<br />
d) Click/tap on “<strong>Manage another account</strong>” and then select the user account that you want to delete.<br />
e) Click/tap on “<strong>delete the account</strong>”.<br />
f) Depending on whether you want to “<strong>Keep the files</strong>” or “<strong>delete the files</strong>” choose the appropriate option.<br />
g) You can delete the other accounts similarly.</p>

<h2>            Personal files not removed after reset</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>
<p><span>I upgraded from Windows 8 to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10 at the end of last year. I have just bought a new computer and have been trying to reset the other one prior to selling on.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><span>I have&nbsp;tried&nbsp;4 times to reset using the&nbsp;reset&nbsp;function in Windows: </span>
<span>Recovery, then Reset this PC, then Remove Everything, then Remove Files and clean the drive, then Reset.</span></div>
<span>Recovery, then Reset this PC, then Remove Everything, then Remove Files and clean the drive, then Reset.</span></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the first try I got the message:</span></p>
<p><span>Your PC has been reset but we couldn't remove all your&nbsp;personal files. If you plan to give away or recycle the PC, try resetting&nbsp;again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the second try I got the same message. When I clicked on 'Got it', the PC shut down and I got this message:</span></p>
<p><span>An operating system wasn't found. Try disconnecting all drives that don't contain on OS. Press Ctrl+Alt+del to restart.
</span></p>
<p><span>Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del just took me in a loop back to 'An operating system . . . . "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After checking Forums I created an installation media USB&nbsp; and managed to re-install Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then tried a third&nbsp; time to clean the drives and remove personal files but got the same message 'Your PC has been reset but we couldn't remove . . .try resetting again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I tried a fourth time and now I have the other message 'An operating system wasn't found. . .&nbsp;'.</span></p>
</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>So, I guess I'll need to re-install Windows with the USB but not sure what to do after that.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span>Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can fully reset this PC?</span></p>
<p><span>thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Steve</span></p>
