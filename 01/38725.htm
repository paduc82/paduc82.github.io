<h2>            i anm unable to install anything after my Adobe flash player crashed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
About one or two weeks ago, my Adobe Flash Plugin began to crash everytime i tried to see a video on youtube, I followed the Adobe suggestion of using their Uninstall software and reinstalling, but when i downloaded it, i double clicked it, and my pointer switched
 to loading one for a few secs... then, nothing happened.<br />
Original Title:Can't install anything on windows 8<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an online guide to solve the youtube crashes, i downloaded Shockwave for my browser; when i double clicked it to install it, the pointer switched to the "loading" one, and then, nothing happened.<br />
<br />
No messages, no warnings, no nothing. It simply does nothing.<br />
<br />
How can this be?<br />
How can i resolve this issuue?<br />
Why is this happening?<br />
<br />
I have an HP Envy m6 with Windows 8<br />

            <p><span>Hi Daniel,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and giving us an opportunity to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand Adobe Flash plug in crashes when you try to play you tube videos and now you are unable to install the Adobe Flash player and shock wave on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Could you answer few questions to understand the issue well:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the Web browser that
<span>&nbsp;</span>you use?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur while installing other programs as well?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Was Internet Explorer working fine earlier?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s perform these methods and find out the reason behind it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try to install the program in Clean boot state.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot: </span></b><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Check the date and time settings. </span></b></p>

<strong>date and time</strong> at the bottom right corner.</span>
</li><li><span>Click on
<strong>Adjust date and time settings</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Once you have made changes in the date and time, check if the website opens without any issues.</span>
</li></ol>
<b><span>Step 2:</span></b>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to check if the Windows installer service is has been started or not.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press Windows key + r and type services.msc.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Search for windows installer service and right click on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start the service by selecting start and change the start up type to manual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to re-register Windows installer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to re-register Windows installer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press Windows key + X and select Command prompt(admin).</span></p>

    <title>Copying images from Compact Flash Card Reader on Windows 7 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayparedes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying images from Compact Flash Card Reader on Windows 7 x64 corrupts some image files.</h2>
                    When copying Canon RAW files produced by a Canon EOS 40D, Canon EOS 5DMk2, and Canon EOS 7D from a compact flash card onto a PC running Windows 7 x64 a small percentage of the files will become corrupt. I've tested this with several internal and external
 USB card readers, with the same results. Always the same images from a set of images on the card become corrupt. On my systems with Windows Vista x32 or Windows 7 x32 this problem does not occur. If you copy a corrupted image from a Windows 7 x64 machine to
 one of the x32 machines it is still corrupt. But it you copy the same image directly from the CF card, it will be corrupt on Windows 7 x64 but is perfectly fine under any of the x32 machines. Is anyone familiar with this issue? Any workarounds? I'm a photographer
 and it's really hampering my workflow.<br />
<br />
This problem has been recreated on the following PCs:<br />
<br />
Dell Dimension 9100 Running Windows 7 Profesional x64<br />
Dell XPS m1210 Running Windows 7 Enterprise x64<br />
<br />
This problem does not occur on the following PCs:<br />
<br />
Dell Dimension 9100 Running Windows Vista Ultimate x32<br />
Dell Inpiron 9100 Running Windows 7 Professional x32<br />
Dell XPS m1210 Running Windows Vista Enterprise x32

<p>Talk about driving you crazy, I may have recently solved this issue for my PCs, but I can't really figure out what the exact solution was. Anyway&nbsp;if you've read my posts above, you will see that I have at least 4 PCs running Windows 7 that exhibits this
 problem. I have two Canon Cameras (40D and 7D) that exhibit this problem and 4 compact flash cards (2 for each cameras) that show this issue. Also this issue never appeared on my 2 other cameras (300D and 20D) or on Windows XP, or Windows Vista.</p>
<p>To test for this ongoing issue I kept one of my CF cards that was full of RAW files, and stopped using it with my cameras. I used the images on this card for testing. I would copy the images from this card to a PCs hard disk then I would make a second copy
 on the same hard disk. One copy of the images I would preview in Adobe Bridge, the second copy I would only view with Canon's DPP. Each time there would be corrupt images in the set that I would view in Adobe Bridge, and no corruption in the set that I would
 only view with Canon's DPP. I would then use WinMerge to compare one of the corrupted images in Bridge with its non corrupt counterpart. Sometimes the files were not different at all, indicating that the corruption was in the Adobe Bridge preview only. Other
 times there was clearly major differencs between the files indicating that the corruption was in the RAW file itself.</p>
<p>I repeated this test over and over on at least 4 different PCs running Windows 7. It became easy to reproduce and repeatable. The differences between PCs was that different images would become corrupt on different PCs. Also changing the ACR defaults on a
 PC would affect which images became corrupt.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, I would test on PCs with clean installs. With disabled anti-virus. With no items in the windows startup. With different video cards, etc. Nothing worked. Then on a whim I purchased and installed FastPictureViewer Codec Pack 2.1R2
 (<a href="http://www.fastpictureviewer.com/codecs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fastpictureviewer.com/codecs/</a>) on one of my Windows 7 x64 PCs. After a reboot, I then performed my standard test above. To my surprise none of the images from the test set became corrupt. The
 first time this has ever happened on Windows 7 for sure.</p>
<p>Great I thought. So now if I take that CF card and copy the images onto a PC without the Codec Pack, then the images should still become corrupt when viewed with Adobe Bridge right? Well, wrong actually. On my three other PCs without the Codec Pack those
 images now copy off the CF card with no corruption whatsoever. Also any new images that I take with either camera&nbsp;show no corruptiopn&nbsp;on any of the PCs with or without the Codec Pack. That's really bizzare.</p>
<p>All I can theorize, is that there was something wrong with some data that was written to the CF cards. Either in the directory structure or some hidden cache on the CF card somewhere. Canon's RAW codec ingnored this bad data, but ACR and CaptureOne seemed
 to not only become confused by it, they would actually write&nbsp;the corrupted interpretation&nbsp;back to the RAW file itself. It's puzzling because showing hidden files and protected system files does not show any files on the CF card other than the RAW images. The
 only thing that's changed on the card is that when&nbsp;I opened it up in explorer preview thumbnails now show instead of the generic Adobe icons for the CR2 files. On PCs without the Codec Pack, the generic icons still show, but the files copy over just fine.
 Whatever it is, by having the Codec Pack build the thumbnail previews on one PC it fixed whatever problem all the PCs had reading the data off the card.</p>
<p>I can't explain it. I've reformatted these CF cards on both my PC and in camera and neither seemed to make a difference. But by simply having a codec generate a thumbnail preview it seems to have "fixed" whatever the issue was. Very puzzling. For the past
 three days I've tried to recreate the corruption problem and simply can't anymore. If it resurfaces again I'll post here, but for now it seems this issue is solved?!?</p>

<h2>            Need Plug and Play Transcription Foot Pedal Compatibility For Laid Off&#47;Cancer Stricken Transcriptionist</h2>
                    
<p>Apparently, I need something called a "plug and play connector" so I can use my foot pedal to navigate through a medical transcription dictation test using Express Scribe for the audio and Windows Media Player for the foot pedal. I have no idea if I got
 all that right. &nbsp;What is this connector, do I just plug it into a USB port and where do I get one?</p>
<p>p.s.--I'm a laid off&nbsp;medical transcriptionist (thanks to voice recognition and low patient census) attempting to take a test to get a job to save my life. I'm also a cancer patient so I need to land a job soon because my COBRA health insurance spikes to
 $645/month in three weeks. Can you help me?</p>

            <p>Nvidia control panel would probably have help links and or question marks where you can check for updates,</p>
<p>It would be the equivalent to both graphics properties and graphics options,</p>
<p>I've never looked at this video cards interface, so me telling you how to navigate through it's menus are impossible.</p>
<p>Resolution would be a good starting place, see if it's set on the recommended setting,</p>
<p>And lower it.</p>
<p>Say you have a recommended resolution of 1600x900,</p>
<p>Lower it to 1377x768 or a couple of notches down.</p>

<h3> dh_2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Touchpad disables itself and explorer.exe is not launched on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Lenovo z50 with win8 preinstalled and upgraded to win10. I love it but recently it did one pesky thing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When ever I shut down the pc or put it into energysaving mode it disabled my mousepad driver. I then had to navigate to "Mouse" in system settings with the keyboard to reactivate it.. every time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just today after a normal boot both the Touchpad driver and explorer.exe were not running. Launching the TaskManager and through that explorer.exe and then the above worked, but I'd like to have it so I never have to do that again... so how can i fix
 this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update tells me I dont lack any updates and an updated Avast Free Full Scan couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Specs:</p>
<p>Lenovo Z50, 64 Bit Windows 10 Home, 4GB DDR3, Intel Core i3, 240 GB SSD </p>

            Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator is automatically built-in&nbsp; to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
The message you receive is the result of using the Microsoft built-in Bluetooth, which provides very limited Bluetooth controls.&nbsp; Microsoft's Bluetooth on allows serial port, modem access and Person Area Network (PAN.)<br />
<br />
You probably need to find a different Bluetooth adapter.<br />
<br />
As for iPhone 4s access, consult with Apple.&nbsp; You usually need iTunes to be installed before "connecting" an "i" device to Windows.<br />
<br />
Also, it have be posted often before but it has been reported that Apple does not let the iPhone to be connected via Bluetooth,.&nbsp; They allow WiFi connections.<br />

<p>Hi darreninniagara,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;When was the last time it was working fine?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does it happen with all the music files?<br />
3.&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</p>
<p>You may not have sound for one of several reasons. Try the following:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Check that the <strong>volume</strong> is not turned down too low by turning up the volume (click VOL+&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows+Vista%2fMain%2fa%2f1%2fa1f060ef-7807-4509-a98d-068422a63ae1%2fa1f060ef-7807-4509-a98d-068422a63ae1.png" />&nbsp;
 ).<br />
•&nbsp;Check whether the sound has been muted. (Click <strong>Mute</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows+Vista%2fMain%2fd%2f7%2fd7e39a10-c004-452b-92d7-2d00c8fa68a5%2fd7e39a10-c004-452b-92d7-2d00c8fa68a5.png" />&nbsp;to
 enable sound.)<br />
•&nbsp;Make sure your speakers are plugged in to the appropriate connection on your computer and working correctly.<br />
•&nbsp;Check whether the Microsoft Windows system volume needs adjustment. For more information about adjusting the volume in the
<strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Adjust-the-speaker-volume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Adjust the speaker volume</a>.<br />
•&nbsp;Make sure the appropriate selections are made in the <strong>DVD</strong> settings. (On the
<strong>start screen</strong>, scroll to <strong>Tasks</strong>, click <strong>settings</strong>, click
<strong>DVD</strong>, click <strong>DVD Language</strong> and then click the <strong>
– or + </strong>under <strong>Audio track</strong>.)<br />
For audio to work as expected, you may need to configure the <strong>DVD Audio </strong>
settings.<br />
•&nbsp;Try configuring your speakers using <strong>Set Up Your Speakers in Windows Media Center</strong>. (On the
<strong>start</strong> screen, scroll to <strong>Tasks</strong>, click <strong>settings</strong>, click
<strong>General</strong>, click <strong>Windows Media Center Setup</strong>, and then click
<strong>Set Up Your Speakers</strong>.)</p>

<h3> baej witalski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X - After update my controller dosen&#39;t detect any headset I plug in and there is no sound.</h2>
                    <div>So... yesterday I played GTA V Online, usually I play with headset (HyperX cloud) pluged to controller and in certain moment the update came up. Obviously I made this update and my controller didn't detect a headset anymore...&nbsp;<br />
</div>
<div>I tried plug in another headset - didn't work.</div>
<div>Another things I tried and also didn't work:</div>
<div>-Console reset.</div>
-Disconnecting the power cable from the console for a few minutes.<br />
-Hard console reboot (without removing games and apps).<br />
I don't know if full reboot give any positive result...<br />
-I even cleaned the mini jack plug with alcohol to be sure if there is no the slightest dirt.<br />
<br />
but.. my console is connected with monitor (not with TV) which has bult-in speakers, so there is no problem with sound ofcourse and I can even plug in my headset to monitor and then I hear everything very clearly. So wha'ts the point ? The point is that I can't
 speak with friends in a voice chat group and that's quite uncomfortable I admit.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas that could cause this problem or fix it?<br />

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>have you reviewed your audio settings and/or trying to update the controller itself again by plugging it into the XBOX ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect a controller to your Xbox One with a USB cable.&nbsp; Keep any headsets connected to the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the&nbsp;<span>Menu</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Devices &amp; accessories</span>.&nbsp; Select the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have multiple controllers attached, you can select&nbsp;<span>Buzz</span>&nbsp;– which will cause the selected controller to vibrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select&nbsp;<span>Update</span>&nbsp;to download the new firmware to the controller attached via the USB cable, and the screen will show the&nbsp;<span>Updating controller …</span>&nbsp;progress screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see the&nbsp;<span>Controller updated</span>&nbsp;screen, press ‘B’ to go back to the&nbsp;<span>Devices &amp; accessories</span>&nbsp;main page</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-select the controller</p>

</p><p>Thanks for all the valuable information that you've shared with us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using the headset with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
another controller</span>? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that the issue might be with the 3.5mm jack where you plug the headset into the
</p>
<p>
</p><p>controller, considering all that you've mentioned. Try it with a secondary controller and let us know if that works.

            Try to configure the audio from the settings and then from voice to see if adjusting it resolves, I hope it is not the pad... However, avoid cleaning with alcohol the console because it could enter the console...&nbsp;You also have the Xbox app on Android and
 iOS you can create them voice chat for the moment

Yeah I tried different combinations by following some guids on YouTube and still nothing.<br />
<br />
<strong>"However, avoid cleaning with alcohol the console because it could enter the console...&nbsp; not the pad... "</strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp; </p></blockquote>
<p>To be clear I didn't clean the mini jack from the console but from the controller.<br />
I was just following instructions from this link:<br />
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help<br />
First topic says:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help#0dcf21a5b1e445c88bd473f8d5c61abf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Examine and

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<strong>"You also have the Xbox app on Android and iOS you can create them voice chat for the moment"</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>Yes I know but in that case I would have to use two headsets at the same time.<br />
I mean an "In-ear headset" that would be used for communication and normal headset to hear everything from the game.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your original description what update caused this to happen? Was it a console system update or was it an update for your controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try forcing the controller firmware update with a USB cable while having the headset plugged in at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try another controller as recommended by XBF Felix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've done basically all of the console troubleshooting so we'll need to try another controller to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend looking for an Xbox Stereo Headset adapter as that is known as a workaround if the 3.5mm jack in the controller is the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;"From your original description what update caused this to happen? Was it a console system update or was it an update for your controller?"</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a console system update (3,5GB). This update came up on 03.03.201.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you try forcing the controller firmware update with a USB cable while having the headset plugged in at the same time?"<br />

</strong></span>Yes and it didn't help.</p>

<p>Actually I don't have second controller and Xbox Stereo Headset adapter but I'm gonna borrow both of these things from my friend so I let you know soon.</p>

<p>Hi Mykhailo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you check the <strong>Service Health status</strong> of Outlook
<em><strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></em> as this may be a server issue. It's possible that the mail servers may be undergoing maintenance. If that's the case, the issue is generally
 resolved automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, we suggest that you perform the steps listed below for missing contacts in People app on Windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Tap the <strong>three dots icon</strong> on People app, then <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Tap on <strong>Filter contact list </strong>and select all available entries on the list.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Email and app accounts</strong>.</li><li>Select your Microsoft email account, then tap <strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>
Change mailbox sync settings</strong>.</li><li>Turn “<strong>Contacts</strong>” (slider button) off, then back on.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This option depends on the device. If option is not visible, please proceed to the next steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the PC go to <strong>people.live.com</strong> page, export all the contacts to
<strong>CSV file</strong> and then import all the contacts from this file (in the same page).</li><li>To export, click on <strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>Export contacts</strong> &gt;
<strong>Microsoft Outlook CSV</strong> (select folder if contacts are missing from one folder only) &gt;
<strong>Export</strong>.</li><li>To import, click on <strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>Import contacts</strong> &gt;
<strong>Outlook 2010</strong>,<strong> 2013 or 2016</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; select
<strong>CSV file</strong> exported before.</li></ol>

<h2>            Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 v1.0 help</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 v1.0 that I've owned for close to three years, it's in like-new condition, but when I plug it into my PC (an HP Compaq 6910p) an open either a word processor or internet browser (not I.E.) it automatically
 starts entering the characters "des" repeatedly, only stopping when I unplug it from my computer. I've downloaded and installed every driver the Microsoft website offers for this device, to no avail. I'm not sure what to do to fix it at this point. Troubleshoot
 and solution?

            Sounds like something is physically wrong with the keyboard. Have you tried another keyboard and do you get the same results? Going by the proximity of those particular keys, I'd say it's a hardware fault.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            I only have one USB keyboard at my disposal. After following the steps from the first response to my question--shy of the Clean Boot--the results haven't changed. I'm hesitant to perform a Clean Boot as that process could render my computer useless. Otherwise,
 I'm guessing the keyboard is faulty, considering it's otherwise excellent condition. From what I've read, others with the same model keyboard are finding similar issues with theirs, so I doubt this problem is unique to me, though not necessarily to<i>&nbsp;</i>the
 specific keys.&nbsp;<br />

----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset driver are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.</p>
<p>As examples :<br />

BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<p>Firstly there's a dedicated Windows 7 forum on this site........</p>
<p>Secondly what happens when you enter the PK?</p>
<p>Thirdly, is this a PK of an OEM (i.e. pre-installed by the computer manufacturer) version of Windows 7?</p>
<p>If the latter, then I'm not sure you can do this - you have to get restore disks from your Vendor. I had the same problem with an OEM key...</p>
