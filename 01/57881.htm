    <title>Live file System-- Session Closing &#38; Improper method of Ejecting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Live file System-- Session Closing &#38; Improper method of Ejecting the media</h2>
                    <p><strong>System:</strong></p>
<p>Vista SP2<br />
Optiarc DVD RW AD 7530B ATA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Session Closing:</strong></p>
<p>When using LFS, the session must be closed before ejecting the media. Failure to close the session
<strong>usually</strong> corrupts the media.</p>
<p>The default setting in Vista ensures&nbsp;that the session is closed before ejection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>I want to know/confirn whether this auto session closing works even when <strong>
we use eject button</strong> on the CD/DVD tray (I will call this <strong>forceful ejection)</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While reading through KB articles (I think it relating to some hotfix for Vista SP1) I noticed that no specific way of ejecting the media was mentioned.</p>
<p>So I would like to believe that forceful ejection shold not be a cause of corrution of media. I wanted to confirm this.</p>
<p>(In my own experience, forcefully ejected media were getting corrupted and could not be read or closed afterwads. Since I shifted to
<strong>software based ejection</strong> the sessions are closed and media is working fine)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer may be useful to many:</strong></p>
<p>If such forceful ejection causes session closing errors, then this might explain some of the disc corruption issues that the users are experiencing.(and they appear as posts in this forum).</p>
<p>(They may have used forceful ejection method as a normal practice/habit. I use to do it too as a faster way to eject the media,&nbsp;then using software features)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional&nbsp;Information: Software based ejection</strong></p>
<p>Alternative to forced ejection involves using eject button/menu option provided in the Operating System :<br />
1. Menu Bar in Vista has an eject button.<br />
2. Right Click the Media Drive and use the eject option form the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope answer to this post would help many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p><span>It is not recommended to eject the disk prior to closing the session. Closing the session ensures that the writing of data has been completed.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I acknowledge that session must be closed before ejection.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question was about a <strong>method</strong> of ejecting.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>I want to know/confirn whether this auto session closing works even when <strong>
we use eject button</strong> on the CD/DVD tray (I will call this <strong>forceful ejection)</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually using soft ejection results in <strong>triggering</strong> of session closing. Whether forceful ejection will also trigger session closing or will it not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

                    <p>On a call with support they basically called out Turtle Beach Stealth 600 as not being compatible with Xbox 1. I&nbsp;was informed that it was a 3rd party product and to only use MSFT&nbsp;products.</p><p>My reason for contacting Xbox support was that i can hear my friends in a party but they cannot hear me,</p>

            <p>Interesting Microsoft say they are not MSFT, I didn't know that. I would like to know if you get this resolved.</p><p>I have submitted a support request to Turtle Beach because I can't hear my own voice through the headset as they say you are supposed to and I have yet to see or hear anyone using a mic online, although I have only had my XB1X for a week or so, maybe no one is talking?&nbsp;</p><p>I can record a voice message and play it back, and see the ring light up in party chat, so I know the mic is working.</p><p>I wondered if my headset was faulty, I submitted that support request with TB 2 days ago and still no response from them, GG TB GG.</p>

<h2>            scroll bar box in windows 8 missing</h2>
                    Is there an updated driver for ATI Radeon HD 4250 on a Gateway NV53A laptop? My scroll bar box is not visible unless the mouse is over the slider box when I click.

            <p>Steve,</p>
<p>Not necessarily a solution.&nbsp; More a prompt for clarification.</p>
<p>Check with Gateway to see if they have an updated or Windows 8 driver for your ATI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the scroll bar, you need to perhaps tell us where you are in WIN8 when you have this issue.&nbsp; Are you somewhere on the Start screen or in a WIN8 store-style app?&nbsp; or are you somewhere on the Desktop side?</p>
<p>ie, where are you missing the "scroll bar" ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, When on the Start screen, if you move your mouse (or rather move (make a motion) on&nbsp;your mouse-touchpad&nbsp; either right-ward or left-ward, the Start screen tiles will move correspondingly for you.&nbsp; I now think this is what you referred to.</p>
<p>This is what is done when you do not have a touchscreen.</p>

<p>Is there a way to keep the scroll bar up? When I'm on a site where I'm browsing and need to consistently move the scroll bar down, it goes away and when I just click on the arrow (that was there, and then disappears) it won't go down, I have to actually
 move my mouse, then bring it back to the down arrow on the scroll bar which shows up at this point. Is there a way to not have to physically move my mouse and just be able to continue hovering over the down arrow and still move down?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I permanently keep my scroll bar up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Maurice... thought I was the only person to have a similar problem.&nbsp; I googled forever it seems and couldn't find a fix for the problem.&nbsp; Turns out it was the most recent Win8 update.&nbsp; I uninstalled it and the normal scrollbar/ box came back.&nbsp; This
 had affected not only Win8 but also every app installed.<br />
See if this fixes it for you!!&nbsp; Best, bob<br />

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So are you saying that the most recent Windows update broke the appearance? That's not very helpful is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do find the scrollbar very badly designed in Windows Metro apps. Even core ones like the main app screen or Store app etc. First I can't see why the scrollbar is so difficult to spot! Can they not make it more prominent, diferent colour anything. It's&nbsp;not
 very&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;which is the scrollbar and which is the background? What happened to that little marker in the middle of the scrollbar?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly is very annoying that the scrollbar disappears after 10 seconds of not using it. I understand that if you are using a tablet or a Windows PC with a touch screen then it doesn't matter cause you use the touch screen but for normal users it's very
 annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Microsoft fix this, you can have a new theme or similar so people who want a more traditional windows theme can have an option. Options are good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Panos.</p>

            Hello Panos... I agree wholeheartedly.&nbsp; I only use the Metro desktop on rare occasions, i.e. when needing to&nbsp; make use of the search capability to reach settings.&nbsp; My problems occurred in traditional desktop applications.&nbsp; The Windows update which caused
 the problems does not universally cause the same problems since I have another laptop which survived just fine.&nbsp; My gut feeling is that it may be an interaction with the video driver, but who knows?&nbsp; Things have gotten way too complicated for us mere mortals
 to fully understand.<br />
I have been testing Win8 since the first release and found it to have greatly improved boot times and a more snappy performance.&nbsp; Metro, on the other hand, buys absolutely nothing for me as an old time desktop user.&nbsp; I have numerous Android Tablets which I
 have tested and it now remains to be seen how Windows tablets will compare.&nbsp; The price will have to drop substantially before I acquire one, however.<br />
Best.... bob<br />

            The disappearing scroll box is SUPER ANNOYING when doing repetitive scrolling, as when reading through, scanning, or editing a document or looking through anything. FIX THIS.&nbsp; Add an option in settings to keep the scroll box open.&nbsp; And here, I've been
 trying to find out how to "fix" this ever since I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Come to find out this flaw is built in.

            So glad I found this string.&nbsp; ME Too.&nbsp; This disappearing scroll bar is SOOOO ANNOYING. I've got Windows 10 now and as far as I know there's no fix.&nbsp; So, we are just going to have to keep the pressure on Microsoft to fix this in a future update, none too
 soon.&nbsp; They should just add an option in settings to keep the scroll bar open.

<h2>            Blank Desktop Icons in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>After updating our workstations to Windows 8, we are having problems with the icons for certain desktop shortcuts. Icons located on the&nbsp;workstations' local C drives are displayed correctly. However, icons located on a network drive (e.g., in the "W:\ICONS"
 folder, where drive W is mapped to a shared folder on a server) are displayed as a blank document-- a solid white rectangle with the upper right corner folded down.&nbsp;If we go to the properties of the shortcut and click "change icon," the correct location on
 the mapped network drive is already listed&nbsp;and the desired icon is already selected in the window, but re-selecting the icon and applying it changes nothing-- it is still displayed on the desktop as a blank document. We have already tried the suggested solution
 of deleting and rebuilding the user's icon cache, but that doesn't help either. By the way, the desktop shortcuts work correctly, they just do not display the desired icons.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is not specific to documents located&nbsp;on&nbsp;a server. Happens also with local documents and programs. I ran into this problem already several times and was able to fix it only via system restore, which is too much trouble really.</p>

            <p>Some observation I made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can restore each icon manually if the program file contains several icons.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you change to another icon and then back to the original, the icon is restored.
</li><li>As Michael described, just re-selecting the desired icon alone does not work.
</li><li>Also, changing to an icon from another file and then back will not restore the icon.</li></ol>

            I got the same issue, but not with all of the icons. And getting an answer is like getting a classified document from the CIA!

<p>Hi Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your earnest effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you are experiencing some issues with your Windows 10 PC. There are several factors which might have caused the issue of your Windows 10 PC, namely, a system configuration,
 an update recently installed on the PC, or a recent installation of a program or of a software. To get you sorted, kindly answer the questions asked by
<strong>PA Bear</strong>, kindly answer the additional questions below as well.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there changes made prior to the issue?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps that you have done in an attempt to get the issue resolved?</li><li>When did the issue start to happen?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For case isolation kindly perform a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows 10. You may check the steps provided in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased a ps3 before Christmas of 2010.&nbsp; I played on this for about 7 months and never renewed my Live membership.&nbsp; I recently came back to Xbox, and when I logged on, my Zone was Cheater and i had 0gs.&nbsp; I figured I would just have to earn my acheivements
 back which would be no problem to me, but, when I try to earn them, they don't count.&nbsp; They instantly reset with a remaining 0gs earned.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Have I done something wrong?&nbsp; If so, sorry won't happen again, I just want to earn GamerScore

<h2>            Will an Asus P4P800 motherboard with a VIA VT6410 Raid controller be able to run Windows 7 &#63;</h2>
                    After running windows 7 upgrade adviser I was informed that the VIA VT6410 Raid controller for my ASUS P4P800 motherboard would need an updated driver. I updated the driver to V550b and ran the adviser again but its still telling me to update the driver.
 I emailed VIA and they told me to contact Asus. When I informed Asus of my problem they said that they do not have a driver for windows 7. Will this Asus P4P800 be able to run Windows 7 ?

            It should run on Vista drivers.&nbsp; Ask Asus if Vista drivers (either 64 bit or 32 bit, depending on which CPU you are using and the version of W7 you are installing) are available.&nbsp; At the time of 'transition' from XP to Vista, Asus were terrible at providing
 drivers, let's hope they get their act together by October 22nd and you may also find there are updated drivers on Windows Update after you get W7 installed.

Hi<br />
<br />
What you need to do is download and run the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=161223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</span></span></a></span>.&nbsp;This
 will give you a good idication whether or not there are any known compatibility problems with the installed hardware/software.<br />
<br />
After this, you still need to do some homework by checking with the manufacturer of the computer/hardware to see if they are support that configuration with Windows 7 just to make sure.<br />
<br />
Like Cari stated, most Vista drivers will work OK, but there are some issues with certain drivers, especially for older hardware. Here are some helpful&nbsp;links for your convenience.<br />

Ja..., das war mir schon klar ;-)</p>
<p><br />
Ich habe bewusst den ganzen Text zum Fehlercode kopiert. Andere User haben haben vllt das selbe Problem (nur ohne NAS), bei denen k√∂nnte es ja dann an besagten Punkten 1 &amp; 3 liegen.</p>
<p><br />
Nat√ºrlich gehe ich (genau wie du) davon aus, das es an seinem Netzwerk liegt. Das wird er aber vermutlich schon mitbekommen haben.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft SideWinder joystick won&#39;t detect in Windows7</h2>
                    
<p>Getting MS sidewinder to work in Windows 7</p>
<p>Ok so I upgraded to windows 7. I tested out a new flight simulator game and broke out my MS sidewinder pro 2 joystick.</p>
<p>First time I plugged it in Win 7 recognized it and installed the basic joystic software and it worked fine. I then ran a search for update win7 found some things then re-booted after it loaded up new drivers. Now the joy stick isn't being&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;by Win
 7, I've tried unplugging it and rebooting and replugging in but now win 7 refuces to recogize the joy stick, when it did earlier. The up date was for my NVida card.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
First I would suggest you to go to device manager and check if the joystick is detected.<br />
</span><strong><span>Step 2:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>I suggest you to follow these steps and check for the device.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Click Start<span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type joy.cpl in the Start Search box, and then
 press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Click your game controller, and then click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>On the Test tab, test the game controller to verify functionality.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Here is the link:<br />

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;Step 3:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>I suggest you to calibrate the joy stick and check if it works, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure your joystick is correctly plugged into the computer and turned on (if wireless).</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double click the Game Controllers link.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find and single click your joystick in the list of controllers. If your joystick is not listed, make sure it is correctly attached and working.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your joystick highlighted, click the Properties button under the list of controllers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the new pop-up window, click the Calibrate button under the Settings tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow all the directions of the wizard that appears and click Finish when done.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also test all the buttons and axes your joystick offers under the Test tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this doesn‚Äôt help, then I would suggest you to restore the computer to an earlier point when the joystick
 was working fine, here is the link:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft 365 Business - how to enroll 2 separate  Windows 10 devices for one license&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading through the Microsoft365 Business information and documentation and don't seem to be able to find a clear answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you assign a Microsoft365 Business licence to an Office365 existing user to replace their current subscription, I take it the license allows only one Windows 10 computer to qualify for the Microsoft Windows 10 Business license and Azure join?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if you have staff member's with a PC and laptop each, how do you migrate and&nbsp; license both of their devices and for the MDM enrollment.</p>
<p>I understand they can have upto 5 activated installs of the Office365 suite it comes with but what about the Windows 10 device enrollment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sean.</p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft 365 Business is a specific Office365 Plan, which does include Windows 10 Device Management, it comes with a set of policies for management of said workstation devices. It is only available in the UK, US and Canada if I recall correctly. It includes
 a Windows 10 upgrade which will even convert a Windows 10 Pro laptop/pc and then it becomes Windows 10 Business, after Azure joining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do some testing on adding a second Windows 10 laptop, and see how I get on. That was my question in a nutshell, how does the second device register in Azure AD, and can it be managed under the same user/license?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more information below on the version of Ofiice365, I am taking about. I have read through a good deal of what I thought was relevant but it all seems to read as if your end user has only one Windows 10 laptop or PC, nothing about a second Windows 10
 device. Obviously the end user would want the same login of email account on both, being Office365 cloud based only.</p>

    <title>Exit Safe mode using ONLY keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sparkplug23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exit Safe mode using ONLY keyboard</h2>
                    Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
So my surface book just died (middle of writing my thesis.. not good!).<br />
<br />
The display was showing weird image fragments, then went black with vertical white lines. I WAS able to use an external screen to then use msconfig and boot into safe mode. Now, in what I can only assume is safe mode, the external screens don't work. So I can't
 see anything. I have got a RMA to replace it, but, I want my files off it.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to exit safe mode using buttons only? Can anyone (with a working device) tell me (or show me with pictures) what may actually be on the screen so I can blindly navigate this?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks, M

</p><p>Start by getting Narrator running.&nbsp; Press Win+Ctrl+Enter.&nbsp; Then you won't be so blind.&nbsp; Also, I was once surprised that using the Project dialog took me out of VGA mode so it can't hurt to try doing that in safe mode.&nbsp; Press Win+P and then with Narrator's
 help switch to Second Screen Only or Extend.&nbsp; E.g. press CursorUp or CursorDown and listen to where you have reached.&nbsp; Press Enter when you want to try your choice.</p>

            Thanks for the reply Robert.<br />
<br />
The Narrator suggestion may actually have been helpful, but I had already sent my device away for replacement by the time you replied. It may help someone in the future.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had tried cycling through the project mode though, but sadly it did not work for me. I have a feeling whatever the problem was it was progressive and it was not a case of me being stuck in safe mode and unable to use an external monitor but rather a total
 failure of the integrated graphics. I had managed to power two external screens via the surface dock until I used that to reboot into safe mode (within 5 minutes of the initial image problem), and that was the last time I had any form of visual output.<br />
<br />
After the reboot,&nbsp;the surface dock video outputs didn't work, nor did a direct mini display port into the base. I also tried the dock connected into the clipboard (without the base to make sure it was not a GPU issue). Even turning on the laptop with the dock
 connected and laptop closed to try force external screen only just instantly showed the black screen with white lines (I could see it through the surface book gap). Two weeks ago upon awaking from sleep the screen showed inverted/corrupted images which did
 resolve after a reboot. So if anyone else has this problem I urge you to back everything up and cross your fingers it's not a precursor to the graphics/screen failing. The laptop was only 9 months old and but fairly intensively, so maybe the heat caused it.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Michael

<h2>            Disabling touch screen for Acer Aspire V5</h2>
                    I currently have Windows 8 on my Acer but I have been wanting to update to 8.1. The screen is cracked on the upper part of the screen so I disabled the touch option to prevent the annoying ghost clicking but when I try to update, the touch screen starts
 ghost clicking again even though I have it disabled beforehand. Because of this the update to Windows 8.1 does not work and crashes. Is there a way I can permanently disable the touch screen and have the 8.1 update go through?

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 i7&#47;512GB&#47;HD5000 running Windows 10 no longer supports 4K on Samsung U28D590D</h2>
                    I, previously, jumped through all the hoops required to install the Intel drivers on the SP3 when running Windows 8.1 and had my monitor working well at 3840x2160 and 50Hz. I installed the Windows 10 today and no longer have the Intel control panel and
 now only have 2560x1440 on the 4K monitor. I've found both versions of the CustomModeApp.exe in windows/system32/ but they don't run and crash. Has anyone worked out how to restore 4K monitor support in Windows 10 yet?

            <p>I have since discovered that if you go to the 5th Generation i7 driver section then you can download the Driver zip file that also supports the 4th Gen HD5000 in our SP3s. I have just installed this driver and I now have the Intel Gfx control panel. I then
 created the custom resolution 3840x2160 but it would not let me create 60 or 50Hz. It did let me create one at 30Hz but, when selected and I click Apply, the screen blanks briefly and then comes back again at 2560x1440. So close but no cigar.

            <p>FIXED!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full procedure: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download zip file from </p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25150/Intel-Iris-Iris-Pro-and-HD-Graphics-Production-Driver-for-Windows-10-64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unpack the zip file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Display settings-&gt; Advanced Display Settings-&gt; Display adaptor properties</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the button (marked with an Admin shield) called Properties next to Intel(R) HD Graphics 5000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the driver tab and click on Update Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select 'Browse my computer for driver software'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The select 'Let me pick from a list of device drivers for my computer'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the 'Have Disk...' button</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click 'Browse...' and navigate to where you unpacked your zipped driver files. Navigate down to the Graphics folder and select igdlh64.inf. Click Open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will install the drivers and your screen may flash a couple of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When complete, reboot. I know it doesn't say to do this but do it anyway as this is where I was going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will now see the Intel HD Graphics Icon in your system tray. You can also get to it through the control panel. Right click on it and select properties if opening form the system tray. And Intel(R) HD Graphics Control Panel should have opened up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Display and then select the 'Custom Resolutions' option on the left. A warning pops up so click yes as we know exactly what we are doing, don't we?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to select you external monitor in the 'Select Display' drop down menu on the left!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the width as 3840, the Height as 2160, the refresh rate at 50Hz and the Timing Standard as CTV-RB. Finnaly, click on the '+' add button on the bottom right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side about refresh rates: I can only get 50Hz on my monitor (a Samsung U28D590). You must enable DP1.2 in the monitors menu. You may find the gui will only let you select 30Hz or 25Hz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot again so Windows knows about this new resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-Click the desktop and select Display Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Advanced display settings and select your external monitor. Your new 4K resolution is now available in the drop down menu. Select it and click Apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now be seeing your desktop in full 4K glory!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Teredo</h2>
                    <p>So, Forza Horizon 4 Life doesnt seem to work for me. I checked the network in the xbox app and it said Teredo is unable to qualify. After trying literally everything that i could find in the internet i came here. So, my issue is: when checking the network
 the first time it says that the latency is big and the connectivity type is restricted, on the second check it says that Teredo is unable to qualify. Teredo doesnt&nbsp;appear in the device manager, neither does it appear in the 'add legacy driver' menu. The regedit&nbsp;says
 zero, the IPHelper works, when typing netsh&nbsp;interface Teredo show state it says:<br />

    <title>driver for microsoft teredo tunneling adapter is disabled and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaynemo  say:</h3>
<h2>            driver for microsoft teredo tunneling adapter is disabled and won&#39;t reinstall.  Have no idea what that means, but what do I do now&#63;</h2>
                    I'm on a homegroup and share a wireless printer.&nbsp; Everything seemed to be working and then I could no longer print.&nbsp; Attempts to discover the problem indicated an address connection is missing (TCP/IPv6).&nbsp; Next I was told the problem was that the "administrator
 (me) had disabled the teredo. and told how to have it reinstall.&nbsp; That automatic solution failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't understand computers at all.&nbsp; Don't know how this happened or what it means or how to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Help!&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype for Mac directs me to an account page, not the service itself.  Can&#39;t do anyyyyything&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype for Mac. &nbsp;For the last few weeks I had very erratic service - (choosing one of two Skype accounts, yes, the second one I never asked for), but at least I could sometimes get into and use my Skype service. &nbsp;Now, when I manage to "log in" &nbsp;I am
 not directed to the actual Skype service which I can use to connect to people, but to a Skype account page. &nbsp;Clicking any and every button, I can sometimes get to
<a href="http://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">web.skype.com</a>&nbsp;that fires up with my contacts - then this doesn't actually work except for the chat function and just shows missed call whoever initiates. &nbsp;But I simply can't get to the usual service. &nbsp;Bizarre to have an account
 page but not an actual service! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to just delete every skype account and start again. &nbsp;But no, at some stage, in trying to solve this problem, I inadvertently asked to change security details on my Microsoft account and now am frozen out for 60 days. &nbsp;60 days in the era of instantaneous
 global communication!! &nbsp;Fobbed off by MS chat service. &nbsp;You are my last line of help, please help, anyone???. &nbsp;Can't communicate with my web designer and due to launch my site next month</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 error 0xc000000f after installing graphic drivers, URGENT</h2>
                    I got an option to update my graphics drivers, but after i updated it froze twice so i reverted to the previous drivers. I ran the component test on the graphics drvers and it says they are missing. I loaded a recovery disk but it wont repair it. Can i
 fix my graphics drver from the recovery command line? Thanks.

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure all your hardware drivers are set and hardware is properly plugged in or try booting from a USB flash drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to visit the manufacturer's website, download the drivers in compatible mode and check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check how to install in compatible mode: </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‚Äò<strong>properties</strong>‚Äô.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Click on the ‚Äò<strong>compatibility</strong>‚Äô tab and check the box ‚Äò<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>‚Äô and select
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7/8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p>30,000,000 meters is 30,000 km. 30,000*30.000 is 900,000,000, so the Minecraft world is nine hundred million square kilometers.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can occur if there was a problem with the hard drive itself, caused by installing another operating system that the computer might have encountered error while doing so. Since it is showing you an orange screen with vertical lines, we suggest contacting
 your device's manufacturer directly to have them diagnosed the hard drive that caused the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help. </p>
