<h2>            Not enough server storage is available to process this command. So far nothing works&#33;</h2>
                    I've been getting this problem frequently on a XP machine where it disconnects from the network and gives this message "Not enough server storage is available to process this command.".&nbsp; Of course I have searched the internet trying to find solutions and
 this is what I've tried so far.<br />
<br />
Increasing the IRP stack all the way to 50<br />
Uninstalling all antirvirus, currently the machines only run Security Essentials<br />
Turn of hibernation and sleep<br />
Using a network switch instead of a router<br />
<br />
^^ none of these have helped so far.<br />
<br />
A little bit more detail of the problem. I currently have three machines running in the office, two windows 7 machines and an XP machine.&nbsp; One of the windows 7 machines is a dedicated file sharing computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows 7 machine never has problems connecting
 and staying connected to the network.&nbsp; It's only the XP machine that has problems.<br />
<br />
As we have found out it seems that the XP machine only cuts out when the windows 7 machine is also accessing the file sharing computer.&nbsp; E.I. if both computers try to save a file at the same time, the XP machine will likely be booted out of the network.<br />
<br />
I set up the the file sharing computer so we could have very fast data read/write.&nbsp; It's currently running a raid 10 set up and has a Intel Gigabit ET Dual Port Server Adapter (It is not currently teamed or anything like that).&nbsp; Maybe the XP machine can't keep
 up or something, it's using a Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet network card.<br />
<br />
Pleaseeee help, I'm desperate!<br />

    <title>Multiple monitors mean multiple Start Buttons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oarking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple monitors mean multiple Start Buttons</h2>
                    Each monitor I have has a start button on it's task bar, I only need one. But ideally I'd be able to completely turn off the start button just like I'm now able to turn off the corner navigations. I have a winkey on my keybaord and didn't have trouble
 navigating the interface in the first place. When other people complained they meant they wanted a full start MENU. But now that they complained, you put something completely different there, I'm the one who has to suffer. I often click on it accidentally
 creating very unnecessary frustration. 8.1's theme seems to be putting in redundant features without the ability to remove them. Give us more customization if you're going to try to give us more options.

            I'm not using a projector, I have multiple monitors set to "extend" which is the correct setting when using multiple monitors side by side. Apparently you need a screenshot.

<div><br />
<div>Thanks to Windows 8's "Multiple displays" options the window that's open on that monitor is limited to that taskbar. Then Windows 8.1 comes along and forces me to use the Start Button I never wanted in the first place and puts it on every monitor like
 it/they suddenly forgot how to handle more than one taskbar.</div>

            As you can see in the screenshot I posted, it's only the "flag", not the rest of the taskbar. Other than that one button they're completely independent and each screen and taskbar shows different windows. I know what Win+P can do, but it's not the answer
 in this situation. Besides, I don't need it because the display driver's interface gives me more functionality.

            Yes, I use that option, that's why there is a taskbar on all of my monitors. The problem, which didn't exist in Window 8, is the Start Button. There is no option to force only one button on the main monitor like there is with everything else. That's why
 I made this post.

<p>Well here we go with another Microsoft mess.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Home Premium &nbsp;32-bit.&nbsp; At this point I have tried to update to Windows 10 a total of 7 times.&nbsp; It takes between 7 to 10 hours to get to the install part of the process and then each time
 it pops up on the screen saying that the installation is trying to recover the install, followed by a reinstall of the previous operating system.&nbsp; The re-install of Windows 7&nbsp;is the only thing that works properly, thank God!&nbsp; I have tried a number of suggestions
 for solving this install problem.&nbsp; The web is loaded with people that are have the same problem.&nbsp; The code error at the end of the 7 hour process is as follows C1900101-30018.&nbsp; A number of Tech people have added their 2 cents worth to solve this problem on
 various forums.&nbsp; WHERE IN THE HELL IS MICROSOFT ON THIS MALFUNCTION?&nbsp; Before the 7th try I reinstalled Windows 7, which included after the re-install some 200 updates.&nbsp; Started the process again and the same exact error code shows again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Starts the process of preparing the Windows 10 setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Starts download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Finishes download and asks to accept&nbsp;blah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Asks you to install now or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Install now&nbsp; -&nbsp; Circle comes up on screen with % of install in the middle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; First section starts "Copying Files"&nbsp;and when it reaches 100%&nbsp; computer shuts down and restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; The large circle with the % inside reads 30% as the second part of the install occurs.&nbsp; 2nd part is called "Installing Features and Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; Computer restarts again and a dark screen appears and a rectangle box appears with noting inside the box followed by a message install problem and trying to recover the install, immediately followed by a message that the computer is recovering the previous&nbsp;operating
 system which is the only thing that works with the whole shooting match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really not sure what is going on at Microsoft, but if this is what you get after a number of years of work on the operating system of the future and it will not even allow users to install it properly, God forbid what is in store next.&nbsp; I cannot understand
 if the&nbsp;1st download does not work why is this&nbsp;set up to have to go through the download again.&nbsp; Why in the world&nbsp;would you not allow the storage of the download so another 7 hours of downloads would be saved.&nbsp; The world is watching and losing more and more
 faith in Microsoft.&nbsp; FIX THIS PROBLEM OR GET SOMEONE WHO CAN!</p>

<p>Phillip ---- Microsoft has been messing with this Windows 10 thing for more than 2 years or even longer.&nbsp; Not sure where you got info that the C1900101-30018 would now be fixed.&nbsp; Maybe if they hired some hackers they would not have all these problems.&nbsp; I
 have a second computer which is my main box and I am starting to get a message that if I do not update to Win. 10 soon that the time is running out on the free-be. Really!!!!&nbsp; Are they joking?&nbsp; The time I have spent with my other computer going through this
 process and nothing to show for it is worth something.&nbsp; Maybe I should get a lawyer and send them a bill for my time.&nbsp; I am on Comcast and they are going nuts about these 7 hour downloads over and over again.&nbsp; Maybe when Microsoft and Apple stock tanks even
 more and the Chinese Hackers get finished with them they will go the way of the A and P Grocery Stores of yesteryears.&nbsp; Good luck with the download, and don't forget that if you don't upgrade soon Microsoft will charge you for their **** later on down the
 line.</p>

            <p>Here was my solution to getting Windows 10 to finally install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently: Windows 7</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus P5N32-SLI SE Deluxe</p>
<p>Graphics Cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti</p>
<p>EVGA GeForce 8400 GS (This card worked on another computer installing Windows 10).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things which have not worked.</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled Anti-virus</p>
<p>2. Clean boot</p>
<p>3. Disconnected secondary hard drive</p>
<p>4. Disconnected optical drives</p>
<p>5. Removed sound card</p>
<p>6. Tried two different video cards</p>
<p>7. Tried two different sets of RAM (different speed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently stuck at 40% (23% of the drivers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next: I think I will try disabling the on-motherboard sound as suggested by BobAnthony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>8. Disabled on board sound (RealTek ALC850 8 channel Codec).</p>
<p>9. Disabled on board IEEE 1394 firewire (TI 1394a controller).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, my Windows 10 upgrade passed 40% where I was stuck before for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am now stuck at 71% (91% drivers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try disabling all Ethernet port hardware next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final Update:</p>
<p>10. Disabled 2 hardware Ethernet ports on motherboard Bios</p>
<p>
</p><p>Success! Windows 10 completed installation.</p>

            Windows 7 works great.&nbsp; What I have heard of Win. 8 and 8.1 and now about Win. 10, XP and Win. 7 sounds like winner's to me.&nbsp; Some independents need to develop a good operating system, they could make millions keeping it simple and staying with it for
 years.&nbsp; To many gadgets in the op. sys. and too many sets of drivers are at the root of all these problems.&nbsp; I am sure there are thousands of computers in closets across the country that still work, but owners have no idea how to get them working again after
 the great updates that computer based parts companies, including Microsoft, have fed to the masses that have totally destroyed a functioning computer.&nbsp; Believe it or not I think that things are only going to get worse.

            <p>To all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hearing Microsoft was working on the C1900101-30018 error the last 3 to 4 days I decided to give the update another shot last night.&nbsp; This is the 8th try over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp; Took most of the night to download and started the install this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The install got to the 30% mark,&nbsp;which basically starts the 2nd step of the install and after the restart the message pops up that the download update is try to recover the setup, followed by a message stating that the previous operating system is being reinstalled.&nbsp;
 After&nbsp;Windows 7 is&nbsp;installed the error message states the proverbial&nbsp;C1900101-30018 is stated as the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much for a fix to Win 10 update!&nbsp; Glad Microsoft does not work on nuclear weapons software.&nbsp; :(</p>

<h2>            desktop activity moderator -  &#34;did not load&#58; dam&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem where the Desktop Activity Moderator (dam) driver does not load.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) did not load: </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>dam</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows 8 PC is touchscreen and as I understand about the "dam" it is a power control thing for Windows Phones and tablets, and tablet-like PCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is -&nbsp;how do I repair this?&nbsp; The dam.sys file is in its place, and the system tries to start it, but fails, so how do I repair that?&nbsp; Can I get that file off the restore DVDs, without erasing the entire system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another post here about the problems that result from this, but just on the general question about fixing drivers that "do not load"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>What gives M$oft?&nbsp; People are still having this issue, it remains unresolved and you pass it over to TechNet Social forum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, look at the number of views of people having the same/similar issue and DO SOMETHING!</p>

<p>Yep happens on my windows 10 machine also although the related links say windows 8.1. I have had this informational event for over a year, since I have owned this laptop. Think I made a post about it last year and was advised to wipe my drive and reinstall
 windows 10 clean. I never did. My laptop came with windows preinstalled. I just ignore it as my laptop appears to have no problems related to the event.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good day! Welcome to the Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Skype Preview (built-in) for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Skype Universal Windows Platform (UWP) App Preview is the&nbsp;new app optimized for Windows 10 that we are working on. You may experience inconsistencies being unable to receive notifications (some users reported
 not getting sound notifications if the app is not running in foreground). We are still in the process of augmenting the app for best possible Skype&nbsp;experience. Please stay&nbsp;tuned for our future&nbsp;updates!</span></p>

<p>Dear Rhiza,</p>
<p>Firstly, thankyou so much for making yourself available to respond on this forum. It is vital that we hear from Microsoft on these sorts of issues. Skype is not just for fun, it is a telephony app, and is an integral part of our personal and business lives.
 We need it to continue to function properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have this particular problem, with no incoming ring notifications or sounds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got an email from Skype telling me that the Skype Desktop App will cease to work on 04-Sep-17.</p>
<p><strong>So on TUESDAY NEXT WEEK I will not hear incoming calls!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any progress on a solution for this problem? I have the latest Skype UA App, 11.19.856.0, and my Windows Store is set to Auto Update all Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Shame on me, I had disabled all Background Apps in order to improve PC performance.</p>
<p>The solution is ....</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that Quiet Hours is OFF: select Notifications at bottom right - <strong>
make sure the Quiet Hours box is not highlighted</strong></li><li>Make sure that Skype is permitted to operate in the background: <strong>Windows Settings-&gt;Privacy-&gt;Background Apps</strong></li><li>Set Skype Settings to make sure you will receive Notifications: <strong>select the&nbsp;</strong><strong>3-dots for Settings, then check all notification options</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is of use to others.</p>

                    <p>My surface book purchased 10 months ago at £2300 has crashed, sent back to Microsoft and they can't fix so have sent me a replacement reconditioned one - do I need to accept that? Surely they need to provide me with a new one?</p>

<p>You appear to be in the UK. I don't know if the warranty is different there. In the US warranty replacements are reconditioned units.</p>
<p>I suggest you check it carefully and if you're not happy send it back and hope for a better one.</p>

<h2>            Laptop cannot detect headphones.</h2>
                    Hi, I recently bought a new predator gaming laptop and I have had a few problems. I was able to fix all but one and was hoping for some advice on how to fix it. The problem is my laptop doesn't recognize headphones unless they are blue-tooth. I plugged
 in many headphones, some in the headphone jack other usb, but my computer doesn't detect them at all. Even when I go to control panel and then go to manage my sound and audio nothing comes up except my speakers. I have uninstalled and then reinstalled my audio
 drivers but my laptop still cant detect them. When I use blue-tooth headphones they are easy to pair and I can find them on the control panel, but as you know they eventually run out of battery and I would like reliable wired headphones that my computer can
 actually detect. What should I do?

With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is a much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.<br />
Another useful feature of the programme is that you can right click an item and select Search Online to get information about the item selected.</font></p>

            Did you disable your security software before you applied SP3?

            I had none installed. The machine wasn't connected to the internet. I'd disabled it. I installed AVG freeware after the application of SP3. Unfortunately, thus far I haven't been able to connect the machine to the web. Perhaps I should have had the machine
 connected to it when I re-instated the operating system by doing a total recovery. At this point I want to discover why I have to double boot this thing, as it were. It isn't my primary computer. I'm replying through my primary which is a Vista and has nothing
 to do with my XP issues. Thanks for asking...and suggesting. <br />

            It's an HP Pavilion with 512 MBs of RAM and a 65 Gig harddrive. It came with an OEM version of Windows XP Home Edition.

            I have generated the reports you requested of me. However, some are quite large and I'm not sure how to post or attach them here. I don't want to inundate you with useless information. I&nbsp; mean the autoruns report I created comes in two formats, one of
 which is 1.3 megs in size and the text version is 160 lines long! I'll try posting that to the bottom of this message. I ran MalwareBytes and SuperAntiSpy and both report a clean system.

Here's the msinfo32 basic report. An export of the program's findings is quite long.

<p>original title:&nbsp;BSOD issue GA-X58a-UD3r / i7 930 / sapphire ati 5970</p>
<p>I am a first time builder who is having a lot of trouble with this particular problem. I am having the BSOD before windows gets to the User sign-in. Every time I boot it gives me the "atikmdg" error. When I go to try to do a system restore, the system spots
 the ATI Catalyst as a program that would have to be fixed so I jump to the conclusion that there might be something wrong with it...</p>
<p>WHAT DO I DO?</p>

<p>FIXED IT!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that I might have double installed the drivers for the video card (one from the website and the other from the CD that came with it. So much for me trying to be thorough! I looked at the list of my drivers in the device manager and just disabled
 one of the 2 listed video cards. Seems to be working now!</p>

 my windows 7 Pro key but same result. My original windows 10 Pro was the free upgrade from Microsoft. I contacted support but could only with lots of difficulty because of accent, managed, or thought I had, explained my problem to the trying to be very helpful
 Indian lady, who took control of my computer and managed to activate my windows for me. The only problem being is that I no longer have the Pro version but windows 10 home. As a business and since XP I have only used the Pro versions so cannot understand how
 by using the free upgrade offer then having to reinstall windows I can only get the Home Version. The support Lady suggested that I purchase the Pro Upgrade from the windows store. Has anyone else had this problem</p>

<h2>            Icons on bottom of screen are gone.</h2>
                    I have a laptop with Vista on it. When I first started using my laptop there where 'icons' (I don't even know if that is what I should call them,but here I go...) at the bottom right hand side of the screen, such as the 'battery level' or the icn that
 shows that I am connected to the internet. One day those 'icon' were not there anymore. I admit that I&nbsp;am not very computer savvy&nbsp;so this makes it quite difficult to even explain what the problem is...even more dificult to navigate using my laptop without
 the icons that I have grown use to. Please help!!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If the Computer does not have Bluetooth then you can add it&nbsp;using Blusoleil or similar hardware (there are many makes available in stores and on-line).<br />
<p>
</p><p>Bluesoleil Software (and hardware) even&nbsp;supports dual pairing - check with its knowledge base, support,&nbsp;end user technical support, and Quick Guides.<br />
<br />

<br />
================================<br />
<br />
Does the new computer have Bluetooth included?<br />
<br />
Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth<br />
Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect<br />
the Bluetooth operation (see how below if needed).<br />
<br />
===========================<br />
<br />
Good idea to update all the major&nbsp;drivers :<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
BluetoothCL is a small console application that dumps all current detected bluetooth devices into the standard output. For each Bluetooth device, the following information is displayed:&nbsp; MAC Address, Name, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, and optionally
 the company name of the device (if external file of MAC addresses - oui.txt is provided) - FREE<br />

BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around you,&nbsp;and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. Every time that a new Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new
 log line is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event Type ('Device Arrival' or 'Device Left'), Device Type, and the company that created the device.
<br />
<br />
BluetoothLogView also allows you to specify a description for every device (according to its&nbsp;&nbsp;MAC address) that will appear under the 'Description' column. - FREE<br />

<h2>            My sound failed on bootup and has not worked since</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Another XP FP3 Kmixer question...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!&nbsp; A couple weeks ago, my sound failed on bootup.&nbsp; XP Home, SP3.&nbsp; Hasn't worked since.&nbsp; Here's what I know...<br />
<br />
The volume control disappeared.&nbsp; If I try to start the volume control from Programs/Accessories/Entertainment, I get "There are no active mixer devices available".&nbsp; My Fax controller (with voicemail) and GOM video player are all complaining about no audio device.&nbsp;
 They all worked before.<br />
<br />
If it's a virus, Windows Defender and Norton are both fooled.&nbsp; I'm still worried about that though.&nbsp; Hijacking the audio startup would be a good disguise, although this one would be pretty poorly done.
<br />
<br />
If I go to Control Panel/Sounds and Audio Devices/Volume tab, "No audio device", Audio tab, No devices, all device fields grayed out.&nbsp; Can't select a device.<br />
<br />
Control Panel/System/Hardware/Device Manager/Sound, video and game controllers.&nbsp; Double click SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio.&nbsp; "This device is working properly".&nbsp; Click the "Properties tab/Mixer Devices, double click "SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio",
 "Driver is enabled, but has not been started".<br />
<br />
Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services, Windows audio is started, it's dependencies, Plug and Play and RPC started, although they weren't when I first looked, I changed that.<br />
<br />
I disabled the onboard sound chipset and installed a sound card, same issue, drivers loaded, hardware appears functional, but not started.<br />
<br />
Went back to onboard audio, reloaded drivers, no help.<br />
<br />
I tried running the utility that recovers damaged system files from the install disc.&nbsp; My machine is at SP3, my install disk is older.&nbsp; It tried to recover a number of them from the CD, but couldn't.<br />
<br />
I tried doint a repair from the CD, couldn't do that either.<br />
<br />
It strikes me that the system knows the sound card is there, but didn't start the drivers, and doesn't offer it as an option as an audio device?<br />
<br />
Below is the bootlog.&nbsp; I'm no expert, but I don't see Kmixer starting.&nbsp; Probably other audio stuff as well, seeing as how sound recording and MIDI are grayed out also.<br />
<br />
Anybody know what's supposed to be starting the audio, and might just quit doing it?<br />
<br />
Also YouTube now hangs.&nbsp; Probably because the audio isn't playing?&nbsp; Probably just an effect or the same cause.<br />
<br />
Help!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Marty<br />

            Thank you for the shortcut list.&nbsp; That will help in the future. &nbsp; I have a small check over each file.&nbsp; I assumed it had selected to be copied which is all the One Drive files.&nbsp; I turned off computer but the small check is still there and can't find about
 the check selection.

            <p>Hi Bryan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What all troubleshooting steps have you performed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to install the latest graphics driver in order to get the issue fixed.(If you have not tried it)</p>
<p>

            <p>I tried what you propose to me and my graphics driver is up to date. If i can help with the research, here is some information about the before installation :</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 2nd Edition CD-ROM installs Microsoft DirectX 7.0a on your system. To install and run the program properly, it is strongly recommended that you update your Sound and Video card drivers to the latest available
 DirectX-compatible versions prior to installing this software. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Microsoft DirectX 7.0a requires that you have installed the latest available DirectX-compatible sound and video drivers or your system may not restart properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To obtain the latest driver for your sound or video card, contact your computer manufacturer. If the sound or video card was purchased separately from your computer, contact your sound or video card manufacturer. Please be aware that charges
 may be incurred when contacting one of these sources.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When i tried to install which it did anyways there is a warning :</p>
<p>
</p><p>DirectX installation error performance may be hindered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps to find my problem. Thank you again.</p>

                    <p>My son downloaded this game yesterday but hasn't been able to play it yet. Part way through the loading process it kicks him out back to the main screen. Any suggestions what we could try? We have rebooted Xbox but that hasn't helped.</p>
