    <title>Windows 10 The User context supplied is invalid - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10   The User context supplied is invalid</h2>
                    <p>When I enter</p>
<p>NET USE \\192.168.0.42\FOLDER1 /USER:\\192.168.0.42\BOB *</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get asked for the password and then get the message</p>
<p>The User context supplied is invalid</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is a registry entry linked to my user because on the very same laptop if I switch users to a different user this exact command works so I know it is not a network or syntax problem. &nbsp; &nbsp; I think the issue is because my user on the laptop is a Microsoft
 user account and on the server I am connecting to &nbsp;my user is my name and it is not liking that and the /USER: is not winning the battle. &nbsp; &nbsp;Any thoughts on what needs changed?</p>

<p>We simulate it on our end, we're anticipating error 53 since we didn't build the domain and all. however \user went through and now we're suspecting as much.<br />

    <title>Missing SSD Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameshillyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing SSD Space</h2>
                    Hello All
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently installed Windows 8 through the upgrade option. Something was missing though when I found out that after a clean install, on my 256GB SSD, that approximately 40GB was missing when compared to a select all &gt; properties. I included all the
 hidden files I could, but still can't think where the massive black hole of disk space went to. I copied a number of games back onto the SSD, and it is currently missing approximately 36.5GB.<br />
<br />
No my knowledge this isn't a problem with the 1000 - 1024 multiplier, but would love some input. Ask your queries away :D</div>
                </div>

            Managed to find it with a program called Space Sniffer.
<div><br />
<div>1. Hibernate was taking up like 15GB, go to an elevated command prompt and type<br />
&gt;powercfg -h off<br />
Unfortunately you need this on to do the really fast windows 8 boot times<br />
2. Pagefile was taking up like 10GB</div>
<div>Depends on how much RAM you have, as I have 32GB, I only need roughly 1GB in case of a system crash, can change this under &gt;System &gt;System Properties<br />
3. System Restore was taking up 15GB<br />
&gt;System &gt;System Properties, go to protection settings, I moved mine to my RAID drive<br />
<br />
Saved myself 24GB of SSD space for stuff that need not be there, hope this helps for your situation. Again, I have to give credit to this Space Sniffer program, found it on another website and it makes it easy as to see where stuff is...</div>

    <title>Word and Excel Not Opening and D2d1.dll File Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avaelaine1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word and Excel Not Opening and D2d1.dll File Issues</h2>
                    <p>I've been having two issues with my laptop for a few days. The first being every time I start up my laptop, I get an error message saying "The code execution cannot proceed because d2d1.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may help."&nbsp; I'm not entirely&nbsp;
 sure what that means but the only thing I've uninstalled since this started happening is McAfee (I have Bullguard now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second problem is that whenever I try to open Word or Excel, absolutely nothing happens. No error messages, no opening and then crashing, and I don't see any signs of them trying to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of that might have caused this, is that after my free 1 year McAfee trial was up, I uninstalled it and downloaded Bullguard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions/solutions are much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Avaelaine, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />The System File Checker might be able to repair the missing dll file:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Or you could try a clean boot which may stop that error from appearing:

<br />
<br />As for the issues with Office, I would try opening your Office apps in Safe Mode:

<h2>            Window Update Service consumes all CPU usage and won&#39;t download updates</h2>
                    <p>Custom installed win 7 32 bit SP1 on a Emachine E625 with 4 GB RAM, all worked well and activated windows. Noticed that automatic updates would not work and kept getting error messages 1st error was 80244019 then all errors were 80070005, then no errors
 but auto updates just kept running without downloading anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed in Task manager that the process svchost.exe was using 100% cpu. went to Services &amp; Resource Monitor and discovered that wuauserv was the CPU hog. I stopped the update service wuauserv and CPU usage went back to normal, i.e. 0%, but of course Automatic
 Updates will not work. I've searched everywhere for a solution, including this forum, but nothing works from multiple virus scans using several antivirus programs to Microsoft Fixit to Windows Update diagnostics to resetting automatic update components, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help, this is perplexing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This is a different system then the other question at the Windows 10 link you mention above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Widows 10 custom installation was started using a win 10 install CD but then the install was cancelled at the point when &nbsp;asked to specify the partition for installation. No partition was specified and the actual install i.e. copying files, etc. never began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was done to see if win 10 would correct the problem but on second thought it was cancelled thinking this was not a good solution
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">as the problem existed even before the win 10 install attempt.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Thanks for your help but got so tired of trying to solve the update problem I decided to install win 10 and it fixed the update problem. FYI, THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN i INSTALLED WIN 7 64 BIT ON ANOTHER LAPTOP, THIS TIME IT WAS A DELL INSPIRON.
 (sorry caps lock was on, didn't notice). Both systems work great and update with Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my next question is, <strong>"why"</strong> didn't updates work on both systems using win 7?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 crashes on startup</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using a month old Toshiba Satellite L655 that came pre installed with Windows 7. It started crashing on startup on Saturday night. I have booted it into safe mode and run scans through AVG Free 2011 and Malwarebytes and they found and removed a couple
 Trojans and a registry error but it still wont boot. I have not installed any extra RAM. If more information is needed please tell me and I will get that info to you guys as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>How does the computer crash ? does it blue screen? just restart or hand ?</p>
<p>have you made any changes recently like installing software ? if so use system restore to take your system back to when it worked before.</p>

<p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>

 Remove Hardware function on the task bar) as needed. The external hard drive was working fine until today, when suddenly it stopped being recognized. It's no longer listed among the drives, but when I click on the Safely Remove Hardware icon, it shows "Eject
 External HD" with no name indicated as it used to before. Also, when I right-click on the</strong></span><span><strong>Safely Remove Hardware icon and choose "Open Devices and Printers", again it shows "External HD" but gives no name
 or letter indication. I've tried right clicking on Computer in the Start Menu -&gt; Manage -&gt; Disk Management, but the external hard drive does not appear. I've also tried using Action -&gt; Rescan Drives, but again the drive doesn't appear. I have another netbook
 that also runs Windows 7 and I plugged the external hard drive into that computer and it IS recognized by that computer. Any idea why one computer would stop recognizing the drive? Thanks in advance.<br />

            Try the HD in different port and restart.

            Thanks for the suggestion. I tried another USB port and restarted the hard drive, but it still wasn't recognized. However, I decided to try rebooting my computer with the external hard drive plugged in and turned on, and suddenly it IS being recognized
 after restarting the computer. Does anyone have any idea why this would happen? Is this likely a problem with the drive. or a software issue? I've had bad luck with external hard drives dying on me and I hope this issue isn't a sign that this drive is also
 going to die on me. I have backed everything up, but I'm still curious if anyone can tell me if this is likely a hardware issue. Thanks very much!

            I have one more question. I've tried to eject the external hard drive using the Safely Remove Hardware icon on the task bar and I keep getting a message that the drive cannot be ejected since "a program is still using it." I know that nothing is using
 anything on the external hard drive and yet I don't want to just remove the USB plug without ejecting it properly using the Safely Remove Hardware icon. How can I resolve this issue? Thank you!<br />

            Just disable power management for USB Root Hub from device manager.You need to do this every time you restart the machine.

            Thanks again for your assistance. I'll try disabling the power management and see if this helps. There is one thing that I thought of that may be contributing to this issue. When I originally used my external hard drive, Windows assigned it as the E drive.
 However, a few days ago, I noticed that Windows had reassigned it as the F drive. Now, after restarting my computer and finally getting Windows to recognize the drive, it's been again assigned as the E drive. Would this switch from F drive back to E drive
 have any bearing on the problem I'm having when ejecting the external hard drive?

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps disconnecting from the internet and reconnects when I click on the wifi icon in the system tray.</h2>
                    I am using a Toshiba Satellite L75D-A7283 on Windows 10. I am experiencing a problem in which my laptop keeps disconnecting from the internet and reconnects only when I click the wifi icon in the system tray. Nothing pops up, my laptop just disconnects
 from the internet. I have tried troubleshooting the network adapter and found no problems. Is there any way to fix this?

            I haven't tried the steps yet, but I'm not sure how the steps would work because the wifi icon isn't an actual program. My internet cuts out on my laptop, not just on a single program. Every program that uses wifi gets affected.

<h2>            My hard drive has disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Just as the title says.</p>
<p>I was exporting a video when my computer blue-screened. This wasn't exactly common, it's happened once before, but it didn't really bother me so it booted back up.</p>
<p>When it started up, I went into Windows Explorer to try and find my video again, which was when I realised the D: drive had completely disappeared.<br />
It was a terabyte drive, and a lot of work has gone into it. If anyone has any help for me I'd be glad to hear it.<br />
The drive doesn't appear <em>anywhere. </em>This includes the Disk Management, Device Manager, and it doesn't show up when I do a disc clean-up or disc scan either. I've gone through so many different tutorials and none of them have worked.<br />
Please help.</p>

<p>i restarted the computer a few times and pressed F2 during startup to bring me to the setup (BIOS), and it was showing up there, so when I returned to the desktop for some reason it has fixed. D: drive was showing up normally.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t print from Windows....</h2>
                    <p>I can't print from windows (note pad, word pad, etc), and I cannot print any scanned docs. I can only print from the internet (email. attached PDF files). My&nbsp;OS is Win 7 Pro SP1, and I have an Epson XP-410 printer/scanner. Earlier today I was able to print
 scanned and saved docs with no problem. Now when I try to print from a Windows program, the printer and computer go through all the proper steps, printer starts, sounds like the printer is printing, but paper comes out blank. Yes, there is plenty of ink, like
 I said, I can print from the internet but not from Windows.</p>
<p>All drivers are up to date.&nbsp; How do I correct this and start printing again? Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying, Nick.</p>
<p>Actually, I finally did get it working again at about 3:30am this morning. I have no idea what I did, I just kept changing settings over and over again. Something must have clicked because it is printing perfectly again! :) I know I started out following
 all the directions in this post: (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/why-cant-i-print-in-windows-7-pro-all-the-sudden/32eb0e1f-ad47-4e22-8ee4-4eb7ae7201e5)&nbsp; which didn't work, so I continued changing settings until it worked.
 :)</p>
<p>It is fine now. I still don't know what happened to make it suddenly stop printing from Windows, and I have no idea which setting changes made got it to print again. Computers are still a mystery to me.</p>

<br />The vsdatant.sys is the ZoneAlarm Firewall Driver and has been known to cause blue screen errors in certain setups.
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling ZoneAlarm and use either the Comodo firewall if available or the Windows built-in firewall.

<h2>            Cannot use touch feature</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;
<p>Original Title: Acer Aspire Switch 10 (touchscreen) pointer disappearing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this laptop for less than a week and already it's acting up. Basically what happens is out of nowhere the pointer won't show up in an open window. I know my trackpad isn't turned off so I don't know whats causing it to disappear when I try to scroll
 into the window. It does how ever appear in the Start screen and when I use the touch screen to minimize the open window the mouse appears and works just fine. I can also see the pointer if I go down to the taskbar but when I try to go into the open window
 it disappears again. Also, it will randomly appear in the window but when it does it won't allow me to click anything and will randomly disappear again on its own. I already returned a similar ASUS touch screen laptop because I was having the same issue and
 I don't want to have to return another one so I would really appreciate if something can be done about this ASAP.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard issue, different letters appear while typing.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Different letters appear when I type</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type (or when I use the keyboard) different letters and symbols appear on the screen. For example when I type 'n' it appears on the screen as 'nh'. Backspace also functions as Enter key. It gets itself sorted after couple of days. Still it is annoying
 because when it happens I'm forced to use the on screen keyboard. My laptop has windows 8.1 and my language preference is English (UK).</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit Blue Screen&#59; USB the problem or a symptom&#63;</h2>
                    For two months random BSOD crashes my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit machine.&nbsp; In looking at the crashes with the BSOD viewer, many of the crashes are associated with ntoskrnl.exe with lots of page faults, memory issues, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout this process, I have
 found my wireless mouse and keyboard stop working.&nbsp; To get them working again, I pull the transmitter on the pc and plug it back in.&nbsp; Oftentimes I need to be relatively close to the transmitter to get them to work.&nbsp; Additionally, my USB with a backup drive
 would occasionally lock up.&nbsp; The device manager has no icons indicating anything is bad and the USB drivers say up to date.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
system<br />
mb - Gigabyte - GA-P55M-UD2 <br />
CPU - i5 750<br />
memory - 4gb<br />
drive - seagate 1.0T 5400 rpm (SATA2)<br />
video card - Nvidia 9500<br />
<br />
<br />
My steps so far.<br />
SFC /scannow - shows no problems<br />
chkdsk - shows no problems<br />
windows 7 - it is up to date<br />
winutlitiies - didn't help<br />
windows 7 utilities shows the memory good<br />
seagate drive checker - shows the drive is fine<br />
video drivers are up to date<br />
no virus or trojans are present<br />
BIOS seems to be up to date<br />
msconfig - with minimal options, still crashes (although alot less)<br />
<br />
I'm at the point of reformatting the drive, but before doing so I opted to use a live CD version of linux with all my drives mounted to see if the PC will crash.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works flawlessly.&nbsp; I can stream 5 youtube videos, run 9 movies/videos, play numerous music
 tracks --- concurrently.&nbsp; This kind of load under windows 7 will result in a crash.&nbsp; As to the USB side, the USB keyboard and mouse can be used at significant distance or have never stopped working. The successful use of linux indicates that I have no hardware
 failures causing me problems.<br />
<br />
So are the crashes being caused by USB drivers or is it a symptom?<br />
What else can I try before a time wasting reformatting or reloading?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>I have been successfully running since March 13 without any BSOD.&nbsp; I did fill up my drive with large files and no BSOD.&nbsp; I was not able to roll back updates to see if that was a source of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone else is experiencing similar random BSOD failues, I suggest try phyiscally pulling the memory and running in different slots.&nbsp; I also ran in 2GB configurations first.&nbsp; This fix seems to be working for me.</p>

<h2>            Wired controller &#40;brand new&#41; won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect</h2>
                    
<p>I bought my daughter a Rock Candy WIRED controller to replace an old wireless controller that went bad.</p>
<p>When I plug it into the USB port the Xbox button lights up -- I can even turn on the system using it -- but once the system is turned on, it won't recognize the controller. All four lights remain lit (instead of just the one corresponding to player 1 or
 2) and none of the buttons work. (My other wireless controllers work just fine, so it's not the system.) I have tried both USB ports with the same results.</p>
<p>Does this official Xbox controller not really work? Did I just get a bad one? Am I just doing it wrong?</p>

I'm sorry to hear about the controller issues.<br /><br /><strong>For this, I suggest contacting the manufacturer of the controller.</strong> There should be a number somewhere on the box that it came in. Since Rock Candy controllers are not official Microsoft/Xbox controllers, their product may have features we're not aware of.<br /><br />Let us know if you have any questions. =)</p>

<p>Hey Nicholas!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to us! Regarding the error 80182300<span> may mean there's a problem with Xbox Live, or that your console has encountered an unexpected error. Try these solutions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever you were doing, try again. Occasionally something interferes with normal actions.
</li><li>Restart your Xbox: Press and hold the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on your controller and choose
<strong>Turn console off</strong>. </li><li>Do a deeper restart: Press and hold the power button on the front of your Xbox for 10 seconds.
</li><li>If you’re trying to use a game or app, uninstall and reinstall it.
</li><li>As a last resort, you could try resetting your Xbox. This reinstalls the console’s operating system. Depending on your network, it could take a while.
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide, then go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Console info</strong> &gt;
<strong>Reset console</strong>. </p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Give these a shot and keep us posted!<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
