<h2>            Microsoft Update Catalog</h2>
                    I prefer to check and do Windows Updates manually, including doing Security Only updates. When I go to the Microsoft Update Catalog, I know how to select the updates I want, add them to the "cart" and then download them to the desktop. My question -- Since
 I can download all selected updates in one visit to the catalog, is there any way to install them all&nbsp;at one time from the desktop location, or is installing and restarting the computer
<strong>after each one</strong> the only way?

            There's really not, at least not officially. &nbsp;You could try to do multiple, but it's not supported and a subsequent one could overwrite a previous one's changes and you'd end up with a version that you shouldn't have had, causing significant issues to
 say the least. &nbsp;Although it's probably less of a hassle now since Windows 7 isn't getting as many updates as it used to.

    <title>Kinecting your Toddler - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Kinecting your Toddler</h2>
                    
<p>When my wife bought me an Xbox 360 with Kinect bundle for my birthday a year ago, I didn't really think our then eight month old toddler will be able for use it, at least for years to come.</p>
<p>Since he started walking, at around fifteen months (are boys that much slower to walk than girls?) he wanted to be picked up when we played. Even while he was still sitting down and crawling, he started waving at the TV, and my wife claims this is where
 he learned to wave.</p>
<p>Since then he gets quite upset when left out. Although the Kinect gets confused if you hold an infant in your arms, it did recognise his hands, and with a bit of luck saw us as one person. He noticed that flailing his arms around, did make stuff move, all
 be it at random.</p>
<p>We tried out more and more games, mostly games where I didn't need to use both hands. Jumping was also obviously quite cumbersome. At this stage the Kinect was mounted on top of the TV, which is on top of a cabinet, at about 7.2 feet/2.2 meter high. According
 to Wilson Rothman (2010), the sensor should be about six feet high, playing at around six to eight feet from the sensor. He also states that this makes tracking people of different heights easier, if the sensor is looking down onto the playing area.</p>
<p>I started with one-handed games like Kinect Sports table tennis, and bowling, where I didn't have to move around much. Kinect adventures also worked but requires a lot more physical activity. I thought The Gunstringer would also work well as it allowed playing
 while sitting down, but my little one wasn't happy with that. Once Upon a Monster held his attention, but due to the different activities needed for each level, didn't really work well either.</p>
<p>Of course, fooling the Kinect into thinking we are one person, and actually having my kid control the Kinect, are not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>As he started standing and walking with more stability, I eventually made him stand upright on an ottoman, while sitting behind him on the couch, guarding him from diving off. As the minimum player height is around 40 inches (Rothman 2010), we had to make
 him a bit taller.</p>
<p>According to Deborah Percy (2011), the Kinect setup should be done again, for small children. I just left the Kinect at being calibrated for me, as getting him not to move while recalibrating, was not an option. Although the Kinect recognising him improved
 when standing on the ottoman, his arms were still too short to really actually play games.</p>
<p>We carried on trying different activities, and decided to focus on Kinect Sports bowling, which is the most simple Kinect activity on my shelf. Sitting behind him I still had to pick up the bowling ball for him, and helped him by moving his arm up and down,
 for the actual bowling. Our bowling effects were only properly recognised 25% of the time, and both of us got a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to move the Kinect to below the TV, on the cabinet, at 4.72 feet / 1.44 meter, instead of high up in the air, to see if it made a difference. My little one is about 19 months now. To my surprise moving the Kinect made a significant difference,
 and by now my little one has learned the motions of picking up the ball, and bowling. The Kinect's new position enabled it to actually recognise enough of his arms, to detect when he's picking up the ball. I still had to help with the bowling, but after a
 few sessions, he got the hang of it, and was bowling without my help, 75% off the time.</p>
<p>What I realised was that the Kinect was still noticing me sitting behind him on the couch. I decided to, for the first time, let him handle it on his own. To my surprise the accuracy improved, and now I only intervene when pressing buttons, as he doesn't
 quite have the coordination for this yet. Although he doens't really understand how to control the direction of the ball, he has been able to bowl a number of strikes as well. When he gets tired of playing standing upright, he even gets it to work while sitting
 down on the ottoman. In fact, playing while standing on the floor also now works, although we had to tape a marker for him to stand on, otherwise he will just stand anywhere.</p>
<p>Although playing with the plastic bowling set we got him is still a disaster, we will try Kinect Sports golf, tennis and table tennis next. With golf, he's getting the swinging right, but he still doesn't quite understand that he has to do it sideways, and
 not facing the TV. With table tennis and tennis, he also doesn't quite yet grasp the concept of action and reaction when there's no physical object involved, like when the ball comes towards him, and having to hit it at the right moment.</p>
<p>All in all, experimenting with the Kinect and toddlers is great fun. It requires fine tuning the physical setup and picking activities that toddlers will pick up easily. It still can't replace a ball kicking session on the lawn, or a tyre swing, but it certainly
 beats watching TV in terms of teaching them coordination and interactivity. We currently stay in a sectional title unit on the first floor, and on a rainy day like today we can't really walk down to the recreation area either.</p>
<p>Now where did I put my virtual nine iron?!</p>

<p>The only games my kid can play properly are Kinect games as her hands are a bit too small for a control pad. She knows how to play her DVDs with Kinect too, she loves putting on a cartoon and saying "Xbox" "play DVD!".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Her current favourite game is just dance kids, I'm thinking about branching out with the Disney and nickelodeon dance games. The controls on once upon a monster were a bit awkward I thought, we only tried the demo, I wasn't impressed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Kinect with kids is fun though! :)</p>

    <title>I need help with a myriad of issues after Windows 8.1 Update and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I need help with a myriad of issues after Windows 8.1 Update and possible Sefnit Trojan attacck</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased the upgrade to Windows 8 Pro with the separate Media Center bonus package (requiring two product keys), and the backup disks in January of 2013.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I never had any real problems and really enjoyed the new platform.<span>&nbsp; </span>
A few days ago I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and I was asked to sign into my Microsoft account at login.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My account then showed up with my email as my name on the login screen. Okay.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But, soon after the update, Windows defender quarantined two Sefnit Trojans, and regrettably I did not take note of the versions, etc., I was just relieved they had been intercepted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The same Trojans repeatedly reappeared as quarantined by Windows Defender so I felt it had not infected my system and continued to take the recommended action to remove them completely (My firewall settings are at the advanced or max, always).<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, very soon I began having a myriad of problems:<span>&nbsp; </span>Internet connectivity problems, MS Security Updates repeatedly failed, speaker service kept stopping, Event Viewer and Logs all unavailable, Adobe Acrobat Reader no longer worked,
 my printer is non-existent and is not discovered when I try to “Add a Printer” or troubleshoot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Many of my services are stopped, and I was notified the Security Center needed to be turned on one time.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more issues but I think you get the idea.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each problem provided its own unique error message that I researched and attempted to correct to no avail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, I tried the recommended fixes starting with the least disruptive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each failed in succession.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the System Restore but the issues persisted. The next problem was when I tried to perform the System Refresh, CD RW disk drive properties indicated there was no media inserted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The troubleshooter could not find any problem with the device and reported the best and most up-to-date driver for my device was already installed.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After more research, I removed the CD-DVD RW drive and cleaned the laser but had the same result after loading a disk, the drive was recognized, but not the media.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also tried other disks with the same results, “No Media” in the volume.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so then I did some more research and tried to create a recovery drive on a USB disk but the operation failed, said the disk needed to be formatted, did I want to format the disk? Yes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It then closed without a response.<span>&nbsp; </span>This occurred several times on different USB ports.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, now I know whatever is going on is not letting me use my “official” backup disk and will not let me create a recovery disk.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I additionally tried the advanced start up troubleshooter and was told it could not be completed and the shadow copy or partition did not exist on this computer. I have looked for the potential Sefnit registry file corruptions (I unhid the files), but did
 not see the specified “bad” entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <em>was</em> able to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Acrobat Reader and it seems to be working okay.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I ran the system file checker tool, and today the Internet connectivity problem seems to have resolved, the speaker issue has not reoccurred, the Event Viewer and Logs are back,
<em>but does say</em> “Critical, Error and Warning events from all administrative logs” under “Custom Views”, and Computer Management is back except for the Task Scheduler. MS Security Updates are installing, Google Chrome keeps opening with a redirect tab
 asking me to allow them to manage my tasks.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am not certain one has anything to do with the other, but I didn’t allow it, just the same. I also uninstalled a few somehow recently installed unwanted programs under Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I must be doing some things right, I still can’t use the disk drive, create a recovery disk, and cannot add my printer, “Windows cannot open Add Printer”, “There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper”, nor does Add a Device function,
 the message then says “No Devices found”.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried to run this as an administrator but the option was not available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I still feel like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included as much as could be pasted of the CFS/ScanNow details below.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you need more info, I can send a Speccy analysis and any other requested info later.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Thank you for any advice and assistance you can provide.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Thank you for any advice and assistance you can provide.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I had previously read and used the information in the articles you referenced and it seemed there were many, many files that could not be found or fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, the files I was seeing were Internet Explorer 6 files that no longer have an entry point for registration. &nbsp;Maybe something left over from XP, I'm not sure. But, r<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">unning sfc /scannow was an
 exercise in futility based on that knowledge. &nbsp;</span>Plain and simple, I needed a Windows 8.1 ISO to do any kind of meaningful troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally found a question on the community under Windows&gt;Windows 8.1&gt;Performance and Maintenance titled "Problems with Windows 8.1 Pro Post Upgrade"&nbsp;<span>that was answered at length by SpiritX MS MVP. &nbsp;In on section he offered "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Download
 Windows 8.1 ISO Using your Windows 8.0 Key" and the following link:</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>http://mcakins.com/2013/10/19/download-windows-8-1-iso-using-you-windows-8-0-key/</span></p>
<p><span>The information found by following the link was</span><span>&nbsp;<em><span>exactly</span></em>&nbsp;what was needed in my circumstance. &nbsp;I used the ISO disk to "Refresh" my system and everything
 is working beautifully now after almost a month of searching for the "cure". &nbsp; It was also incredibly simple and fast to accomplish.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your time and efforts and I hope my posting this information here will be helpful to someone else who is at their wits end looking for a solution.</span></p>

</p><p>I have updated to the latest driver for my video card etc..</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting you query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for not addressing you in a timely manner. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;issue could be&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;graphic card not being updated.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on your Start menu, click the&nbsp;<strong>Settings </strong>button.</li><li>At Settings, click the <strong>System</strong> option.</li><li>At the <strong>Display tab</strong>&nbsp;, scroll down and click <strong>A</strong><strong>dvanced Display Settings.</strong></li><li>At Advanced Display Settings, click <strong>Display Adapter Properties</strong>.</li><li>A window will pop up showing your installed graphic adapter. Click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>The properties window will pop up. Go to the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. This will install the necessary files to update your display adapter.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>During the installation you might experience a few flashing "black screens" - don't worry, this is part of the installation process. Afterwards, though, your monitor will revert to the normal brightness it usually was before your update! Your brightness
 toggle switches will work again once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Please let us know if the issue persist and we will be happy to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Many thanks - the answer would have been very useful if the problem was not more profound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft support.</p>
<p>The problem was investigated and would have taken more than your suggestion to resolve.</p>
<p>The kernel of the operating system had somehow become corrupted and needed some delicate restoration.</p>
<p>The problem has now been fixed and I hope that is the last of my Windows Ten installation woes!</p>

<h2>            unaccounted hard drive memory space</h2>
                    <p>I use a PC with Windows Vista 32 bits</p>
<p>I recently deleted about 55 GB of files&nbsp;from my hard drive, but when I checked Drive C, I noticed that only 30 GB were freed and not 55 GB??</p>
<p>I&nbsp;cleaned the disk and removed all system restore points, but I am still missing 20 GB?</p>

</li><li>
<p>In the <span>Disk Cleanup Options</span> dialog box, choose whether you want to clean up your own files only or all of the files on the computer.

 confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>If the <span>Disk Cleanup: Drive Selection</span> dialog box appears, select the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Disk Cleanup</span> tab, and then select the check boxes for the files you want to delete.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you finish selecting the files you want to delete, click <span>OK</span>, and then click
<span>Delete files</span> to confirm the operation. Disk Cleanup proceeds to remove all unnecessary files from your computer.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Programs and Features.</span> Opens Programs and Features in Control Panel, where you can uninstall programs that you no longer use. The Size column in Programs and Features shows how much disk space each program uses.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>System Restore and Shadow Copies.</span> Prompts you to delete all but the most recent restore point on the disk.</p>
<p>System Restore uses restore points to return your system files to an earlier point in time. If your computer is running normally, you can save disk space by deleting the earlier restore points.
</p>
<p>In some editions of <span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span>, restore points can include previous versions of files, known as shadow copies, and backup images created with
<span>Windows</span> Complete PC Backup. This information will also be deleted. For more information about System Restore, search

<p>the problem I have is that I deleted 55 GB worth of files from the HD, but only 30 GB were added to the HD free space.</p>
<p>Even when I did all of the above ( which I did before writing) I still did not see all the 55 GB added to mhy HD free space?</p>
<p>So the question is: what happened&nbsp;to the 25 GB?</p>

<p>Yeah,&nbsp;I used&nbsp;the jam application and scanned with malware bytes before&nbsp;writing here.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;Original Hard Drive is 350 GB, but it shows that 291 GB are only available due to space taken up by system restore etc...</p>
<p>Of the 291 GB,&nbsp; there are 20 GB unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Changing the system restore capacity will not resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>There's logical disk and physical disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical disks correspond to the hardware. Physical disks have sectors, <br />
tracks, cylinders, etc. Physical disks can be divided into logical drives. <br />
For example one physical disk on a computer can be divided into logical <br />
drives C: and D:. Users interact with logical drives. Logical drives have <br />
properties like disk space.<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Think about the number of times you open a document file in MS Word but do not scroll all the way through it.) Lazy write deferred disk updates occur sometime
<em>after</em> the original logical file request. The update needs to be applied to the physical disk, but the required physical disk operation is usually not performed right away. So what is happening at the physical disk
<em>right now</em>, as expressed by the current logical and physical disk statistics, is usually
<em>not</em> in sync with logical file requests. This is the influence of caching. Caching makes it almost impossible to determine which applications are causing a physical disk to be busy except under very limited conditions (when very few applications are
 using the disk, for example)."</p>

<h2>            Need to change email, how will this effect my digital licence</h2>
                    <p>I believe my PC and emails have been compromised recently and I want to make a new hotmail and new gmail. But with my Windows 10 Pro to activate it I have to use my hotmail user and pass since it is a free upgrade from windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I wipe my SSD and do a fresh install of windows 10 I would like to know how I can safely transfer my digital license to a new hotmail email. I don't really want to do it on my current install of windows as I believe it to be infected with something
 that my virus checker can't find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen some posts during searches saying it can not be done, and other saying you can add more users to your current one and then change one of those as a default somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, looking for info if it is possible, how to do it safely, and hopefully be as painless as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can not be done I do still have my windows 8.1 pro retail DVD and Key and could go back to that older OS. But I like windows 10 now.</p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, I'd act this way:
<br />
<br />1) RETRIEVE YOUR WINDOWS LICENSE FROM YOUR OFFICE COMPUTER

            Hi skozzy,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You have got a digital license which is tied to your Microsoft account not to your mail account. You can change mail ID of your Microsoft account without impacting your license entitlements.
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            <p>It's not duplicated 5 times, it just looks like that.&nbsp; There's a zoom slider in the lower right corner. When it is moved to the far left, you have a storyboard view where each item is represented by a single image.</p>
<p>As you move it to the right, each item expands to represent its actual duration which may repeat the thumbnail image several times.&nbsp; Notice however that the first one is the only one that is bright. The rest are darkened to show you that they are just repeats
 of the same image.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this expanded view confuses you, just move the slider back to the far left and you'll have one thumbnail per item.</p>

            <p>Hi leeannelloyd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you said import pictures, are you&nbsp;referring to adding pictures in story board of Movie Maker or just simply importing your pictures in your pc? If you are referring to&nbsp;adding pictures in&nbsp;Movie Maker&nbsp;then it means that what you are seeing is not duplicate
 pictures but multiple frames on the storyboard just like what considerate_guy explained on his post.&nbsp; If the zoom time scale option is set to 75%, every time you import a single picture or video in Movie Maker it will stretch a single picture or video frame&nbsp;up
 to&nbsp;six (6) frames on the storyboard&nbsp;timeline thus making it appear duplicates.&nbsp;You can adjust it by moving the slider of the Zoom time scale to the left or by pressing these keys, hold
<strong>ALT</strong> and press (-)<strong>. </strong>The Zoom time scale option is located on the bottom&nbsp;right&nbsp;corner of Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case, please send us a screenshot of your storyboard after you import a single picture in Movie Maker. To do this, please follow the steps in the solution article below:</p>

But that's all it does.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Btw, the Xbox 360 WIRED controller works with my PC just fine. I just bought the controller today and works fine with the PC and can power the Xbox 360 Console E on.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tytusstrube  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Crash</h2>
                    <p>My setup is:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASUS ROG Zenith Extreme motherboard</li><li>AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX processor</li><li>ASUS Strix Radeon Vega 64 graphics</li><li>G.SKILL Ripjaws V DDR4-3000 128GB memory</li><li>Samsung 970Evo 2TB solid state drive</li><li>Windows 10 64-bit</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Everything I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving everything at default settings</li><li>Updated Windows with all updates</li><li>Updated BIOS, chipset, graphics, SSD drivers</li><li>Hot start (Restart)<br />
</li><li>Warm start (Shut down and start)<br />
</li><li>Cold start (Shutdown and start after removing power cable for 5 minutes)<br />
</li><li>Reinstalled Windows 4+ times (Some where clean installs after completely wiping the drive, others left the personal files intact)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: Every so often Windows will crash on me. Sometimes I will be playing a game, others I will be surfing the Internet. Sometimes I will be doing nothing (just sitting on the desktop without moving the mouse or having any open programs), others it will
 crash during just after loading Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas or solutions to fix this?</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your SSD or Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.
<br />
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

<p>CHKDSK didn't return anything. So my SSD should be good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MemDiag on the other hand, didn't return anything. I know it found at least 1 bad sector, but it never displayed the results. I went to the Event Viewer and the only thing it lists is when I scheduled it. I ran it 3 times and still no dice on the results.
 Then I went to MemTest to create a bootable USB to use for the test and it wouldn't create a bootable USB on a brand new USB drive. I tried with and without the format option checked.</p>

<p>It may be that you will not be able to install windows 7 on your new laptop as it is most likely incompatible with the hardware in your computer. Here is an article from last year.</p>

            Yeah somebody got paid a kick back this version of windows sucks it is worst than vista and 8 put together. And Microsoft is almost imposable to get help from there tech support. I could get GOD on the phone easier. Bill Gates is just a rich prick who
 doesn't give a crap as long as he can make more billions of dollars well he will have to answer to a higher power for his actions and the measly charity donations wont do ant good to save him.

<p>We appreciate your response, Michael. Since your Windows 10 is pre-installed on your laptop, and you wish to have a Windows 7 Professional, yes, you may install it; however, there is a possibility that without a compatible driver for Windows 7, it may not
 work properly. We suggest that you get in touch with your device manufacturer for an in-depth assistance regarding this matter.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why does Microsoft hate its users so much that Microsoft Broke Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miskyash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft hate its users so much that Microsoft Broke Windows 7 Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;june 30 I ran Windows Update for my 2 computers there were 6 &nbsp;security updates available and I selected them and everything seemed fine but the next morning after noticing the HDD activity light flashing, I FOUND the SSD's on both computers completely FULL.&nbsp;
 All indication are Update chose to download WIN10 and backed up my OS to my&nbsp;SSD without any permissions.
</p>
<p>I was told the only way to remove the files was to do a clean install. So I did, then I found out that Microsoft had sabotaged their Win7&nbsp;Update. Why? To force users to "upgrade to their latest form of MALWARE Win10".</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the past 2 weeks I have been in Microsoft Tech Support ****. Getting told everything from, "You don't need those Windows&nbsp; Updates anymore" to "That is a known problem, we have fixed it and it should not be a problem anymore" ... ALL LIES!!! Inconsistent
 Tech support by people that really do not have the complete knowledge to do anything. I have had countless Microsoft Techs remote in check a few things say they have to restart&nbsp; and will be right back... they never come back and I have to start the whole lame
 process over. Level 2 Tech callbacks, I have had 5 scheduled and never heard from one! By accident I found one tech&nbsp;that knew the problem with WIN 7 Update and fixed it on my first computer. He was supposed to call me back the next day top fix the second one
 but never did. I contacted Microsoft Support and asked If indeed the problem was fixed and was assured by the person 12,000 miles away that everything was working fine and I should go ahead and do the Clean install on the 2nd computer... NO WINDOWS UPDATE
 just runs and does nothing. </p>
<p>The troubleshooters and Fixit APPS are all disabled or broken. I try Tech Chat again and find someone familiar with the problem and he gets Windows Update running&nbsp;and hands it over to me. I run Windows Update and for about 120 updates it downloads and installs
 fine. Then it fails and won't work again. I follow the Troubleshooters etc and its still broken.
</p>
<p>This Fiasco is generated by Microsoft's inept and idiotic management the same idiots that gave us VISTA.</p>
<p>When will Microsoft get their act together and quit trying to bamboozle they users into just another form of NT with a lot of window dressing and no real improvement. When Will Microsoft get the idea they need REAL TECH SUPPORT in America not India. When
 Will Microsoft actually care about their products working instead of meeting a deadline and having disgusted customers because the new OS is garbage and its not really new!</p>
<p>REAL TECH SUPPORT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

            You can disable a "broken" update by setting it to "Never check for updates" and restarting Windows. You can download KB3161608 and KB3020369 manually and install them. Upon doing this, Windows update will be fixed.

            <p>Did the suggested operation and all it did was try to download for over an hour and nothing happened!</p>
<p>Took my USB drive and my LINUX netbook and downloaded the 2 updates and then installed to the ailing computer... that worked!</p>
<p>But it still does not answer the question of WHY Microsoft Hates It customers? Why break Windows Update?</p>
<p>Why It cannot produce a good and useful OS except by what appears to be accident. VISTA, WIN8, and WIN10 they just do not work, at least not when new or is Microsoft still using us as its BETA testers. I also find it unusual that Cities and Universities
 still run XP over any of the new upgrades!</p>

<p>3161608 was replaced by 3172605 but fails to download. You either get Error 404 or sent to the Support Home page. You can still download the "Standalone Installer " but not the other required patch. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I share your feelings.&nbsp; However, lets get things up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated two computers and it took less than 15 minutes for each to complete the process.&nbsp; Here is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make certain your computer is not busy.&nbsp; Do that by bringing up Task Manager.&nbsp; If the %&nbsp; CPU in use isn't around 10%, it's busy doing something.&nbsp; It could well be that it is still trying to run Windows Update in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Windows update and change the setting to NEVER, and by the way, keep it that way for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Close Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type services in the text box above the start globe.&nbsp; Select Services.&nbsp; Find Windows Update in the list.&nbsp; Right-click and choose Stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>go to this web site:&nbsp; <a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/2016-07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wu.krelay.de/en/2016-07.htm</a> There you will find a set of 5 updates.&nbsp; Download and store each of them in a folder on your desktop.&nbsp; Close your browser</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, install each of them.&nbsp; It could well be that any or many of them will be reported as already installed.&nbsp; That's OK.&nbsp; After installing each of these manual updates, restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart, start Windows Update.&nbsp; When the list comes up 5 minutes later, choose the updates you want and proceed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my advice on how to prevent Win10 from invading your space.&nbsp; It works well on all 150 of my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer…..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update (<strong>WU</strong>)&nbsp;manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January 14, 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates
 should be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7 other than fixing security issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
