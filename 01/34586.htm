<h2>            Problem with updates on Windows 8 - Configuration failed &#38; reverting changes</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">First of all,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I would like to apologize for asking about the problem that has been solved so many times...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">... yet it seems that no solution applies to / solves my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Let me describe my situation and background 'briefly':</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have Windows 8 Pro installation that I installed in September 2012. I had been provided with Win 7 and Win 8 activation keys as an IT student during my studies. I haven't used Win 8 much since I preferred Win 7 and only wanted
 to test the "product".</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Judging from the times when some previous updates were installed, the system was launched several times in March 2013, December 2013 and January 2014. After that the system has "slept" until now. When I launched the system on 26.07.2015
 there were like 50 updates that were prepared (or wanted to be installed ... let's say "pending"). About 30 of them successfuly installed. Then I re-checked. I have a habit of rechecking availability of updates when some fail to install (mainly from my previous
 experience that sometimes an update is not needed anymore when another installs).</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Now, to the point...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have 133 important and 3 optional updates that want to be installed. Any that I select (few of them or all of them) fail to install. The installation begins normally, then needs restart (all of them) and during the nex boot up,
 the updates get to "configuring updates .... 98%" and then fail and begin <strong>
reverting back</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The system is more or less vanilla installation with some basic drivers and 3DMarks so I doubt that I have caused this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have been googling and trying to solve this for 5 days by now, here is what I have found:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. First of all, I tried sfc/ scannow to see whether there is any corruption. I got message that some files were corrupt and could not be fixed. On the 6-7th launch of this command, I finally got "Windows Resource Protection did
 not find any integrity violations." (it is true though that I tried many solutions in the meantime). Nevertheless before that, the CBS.log included information that:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Cannot repair member file "utc.app.json"</p>
<p class="contentStandard">(also "telemetry.ASM-WindowsDefault.json" and i believe "Amd64\CNBJ2530.DPB" were mentioned ... several times)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But as I mentioned, as of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
this moment</span> I do not experience this issue.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">2. Since I was having problem with sfc, I tried DISM.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>ScanHealth </strong>returned :</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The component store is repairable.<br />
The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">However <strong>RestoreHealth </strong>was not optimistic:</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>The restore operation failed. Either the repair source was not found or the comp</span><br />
<span>onent store cannot be repaired.</span></p>
<span>onent store cannot be repaired.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The log included:</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSI Store Metadata refreshed:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">3. The next "solution" that I focused on was System Reserved partition. I came to information that Windows 7 uses 100 MB Sys. Reserved partition while Windows 8 uses 350 MB. I think that I came upon an information that this may
 be connected to the problems so changed the partition layout (safely with respect to the System Reserved and Windows 8 partitions) and grew the partition by additional 250 MB. This however proved to be unconnected.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">4. Some sources claimed that the contents of SoftwareDistribution/Download may be the case. So after stopping the Windows Update service i deleted the contents of Download (I think that on 1 try I event deleted pending.xml from
 WinSxS. Of course then I relaunched the service, redownloaded updates, etc...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">5. I tried the Windows Update Diagnostic.cab from MS servers (just for record, this tool renames pending.xml among others). This diagnostic always finds problems no matter how many times I launch it. Sometimes it displays 2, sometimes
 3 issues e.g.:</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/348aba31-8253-4f69-bb20-5bd108865f07" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">These are the major "solutions" that I was trying, but as you may guess, none of them worked. Just for the record Windows reported these problems viac Action Center:</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fddfb08c-fc8a-4ef0-8171-46e2a79fe4f7" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">And I also found some information in the WindowsUpdate.log:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">2015-08-02 01:27:28, Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00000004@2015/8/1:23:27:28.681 (F) CMIADAPTER: AI failed.

<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here, the infamous <strong>rollback</strong> is mentioned. I have been unable to pinpoint the exact update (or updates) which causes these rollbacks so I hope that is something that I could be helped with at least. The internet
 is full of KBs that cause this so I cannot rely on that, at least for now. I would also like to note that I tried everything under Clean Boot. And also cannot do clean installation since I do not have access anymore to the MSDNAA where I had the activation
 key as a student. I hoped that I could do upgrade to Windows 10 without it in the upcoming months, so that's why I am focusing on getting this environment to work and to migrate to it in time.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I will be very grateful to anyone who can help me with this problem.</p>

            <p>Since nobody could help, I helped myself ^^.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, to all who have problems with the fact that their updates install all at once, you need to change Windows Update settings. Change option to other than automaticall installation (I used automatic download, manual install). This way you can install
 updates in smaller batches. I personally installed updates by 5 or 10 (or so). Updates that were several tens of MB large, I installed alone. What suprised me the most, I was able (in time) to install all updates. In case you would not be you would at least
 definitely know which update you need to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all updates were installed I turned on the automatic download and installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Folder View Option Changes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Folder View Option Changes</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a couple of months ago my folder view options on some folders keep reverting to "details" from my preferred option of "Medium-sized icons". This happens mostly between re-boots, but can happen when closing then re-opening a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders in question are ones that contain shortcuts to various programs. This was all right from when I installed Windows 8 through to Windows 8.1, so ok for a year or more, then suddenly the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to remember something similar in XP, that was caused by a registry entry limiting the number of icons that could be stored, or by some system file being corrupted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian Morley.</p>

            <p>Hello Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you recently made any hardware or software changes to your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to incorrect registry settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + R keys</strong>, type <strong>regedit </strong>in run window and press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Navigate to the following registry sub-keys:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell</strong><br />
<strong>HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To increase the number of folders that Windows can remember the view settings for, create a "<strong>DWORD</strong>" value named "<strong>BagMRU Size</strong>" in each of these registry keys, and set its value data to the number of folders that you want
 Windows to remember the settings for. For example, if you set the value to <strong>
5000</strong>, Windows can remember the settings for <strong>5000</strong> folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

    <title>Windows 8 HDD Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenthalas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 HDD Problem</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, my computer froze without warning while idling. I powered it down, and when I attempted to power back on, the computer does not get so far as to boot up Windows 8.1. The computer sits for a long period (about 20 minutes) on the initial Windows
 8.1 loading screen after POST, then quickly flashes a BSOD faster than I can read, and restarts. It then attempts to run the automatic repair utility on the next restart but this never completes, and after more than an hour of leaving it to just sit, never
 does anything. I had a second hard drive which I moved to the primary SATA port and installed Windows Vista to try to do some kind of diagnosis. However, if the original disk with Windows 8.1 is plugged into both SATA power and data while the computer is starting
 up in Vista, Windows will not start, and gives me error code 0x0000007B. My BIOS recognizes both HDDs without incidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot normally into Windows Vista and have the original HDD set up on a SATA hot plug, whenever I plug it in with Windows already running, Windows recognizes that the drive has been plugged in, up to and including recognizing the model and installing
 the correct driver. However, if any attempt to access the drive through My Computer or similar is made, the system again locks up. For a moment, before the lockup, it shows the drive titled "System Reserved" and the size as about 300MB (it's a 2TB HDD). I'm
 not sure how to proceed at this point, or if there are any programs or software that can assist. If the HDD is bricked, I'd like to know that for certain, and if it is recoverable after somehow accessing and rewriting the boot sector or file system, I'd like
 to know that for certain and figure out how to do it. Thanks for any help!</p>

            gotta love it when they beat around the bush, <br />
<br />
Seatools cannot see any HDD when the controler is in AHCI mode <br />
because AHCI does not use the same ports as Standard IDE channels,<br />
<br />
you must switch the controller to<br />
IDE / ATA / Legacy / Compatibility mode<br />
whatever the System UEFI/BIOS calls it. <br />
<br />
enter the UEFI / BIOS with the correct entry key and change the controller mode,<br />
then Seatools should see the disks.

            Deleting your MSN Messenger address, which is likely a Microsoft Account (outlook.com, msn.com, hotmail.com, live.com) would also close your Skype Account. 
<br />
<br />You do have the option though of changing the primary email address, which is likely what you want to do without closing the account:

Have tried pc reset and also the upgrade and install .exe files (Windows10Upgrade9252.exe and MediaCreationTool1803.exe) but all failed around the 58% mark.<br />

I would rather not format the disk and install from scratch. This Microsoft support file explains replaces the corruped file with a new one but have to find a replacement file.<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.       
        </p>

            I'm afraid there is no much that can be done if the suggested options are not working. You might just have to accept the reality and prepare to perform a custom install.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try signing into the local Administrator account then attempt the repair upgrade fro there again.

            A rough look at the Setuperror file says DISM failed. DISM is a utlity that helps in migrating drivers.
<br />Post back the results of DISM commands and that fails too share DISM log.

<h2>            Customize Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to customize the Start menu? Specifically, I want to move "Notification Manager for Acrobat Reader" to a custom folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to create an Adobe folder:</p>
<p>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Adobe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I can right-click a program and click More &gt; Open file location. However,&nbsp;<span>"Notification Manager for Acrobat Reader" doesn't have an "<span>Open file location" option.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I've tried looking for the shortcut in these folders:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
C:\Users\All Users\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
C:\Users\Default\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>But I am unable to find it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Any help would be appreciated.</span></span></p>

            Have you tried opening the shortcuts properties and there should be an open file location button, if that isn't there or doesn't work, the target and start in fields have the path to the file or its containing folder.

</p><p>If I click App settings, there are options to repair, reset, and remove the app, but not to put it an the Adobe folder I created.</p>

<p>Check this website&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://geelaw.blog/entries/adobe-reader-sideloads-app-to-windows/<br />
</p>
<p>After reading this it seems like it might be an app sideloaded by Adobe Reader while its being ran that made its way to your start menu. I can't seem to find the notification manager on my pc even though I have Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. This was the only
 article on it I could find and I was unable to find anywhere on the internet that specifies where it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only suggestion is to try and open the files location while adobe reader is running or to look through Adobe Reader's install directory.</p>

Well I don't think roll back will work because this happens quite some time ago. And I've installed many many optional updates and I do not know which one to roll back. Thank you for your answer. I will try it.<br />

<p>Check your air vents on the laptop to make sure they're clear of dust, lint, pet hair, etc. A can of spray air works pretty good for clearing then. Just blow it backwards for exhaust to intake.</p>

Judging by the pics it's very likely faulty hardware. <br />
If there is no problem when using only the generic Windows drivers via Device Manager with no Nvidia drivers installed that would likely be due to the card just acting as a 'pass through' for the graphics.<br />
That you seemed successful briefly is probably just an indication that you did install the Nvidia drivers<br />
successfully, but as soon as the card got up to temp it started failing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's not the final word, so do as suggested by Gerry and upload the files he requested.<br />
Post the temps for both cpu and gpu as well.<br />

<h2>            Scheduling Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am, until now, reasonably happy using Windows 10, apart from Edge not allowing plugins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, this morning, when I have a critical exam to study for for tomorrow, the system chooses to update then and 75 minutes later, when it finally downloads everything, now I can't get in because there is an error message and I have to log in from a different
 computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read other threads, it's not possible to schedule the updating so, basically, to be honest, I'm so angry about all the lost time, if I can't schedule updates then I want to switch back to Windows 7. So, basically, how do I do that? Because now, I
 have a critical exam tomorrow and have not been able to access my information for nearly 4 hours! How on earth can Microsoft not have an option to schedule an update, especially a major update that's going to take over an hour? How on earth do they think that
 that's acceptable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, if I can't schedule updates when it's convenient to me, I'll switch to a Mac! I'm SO frustrated about it it's not true!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, your helpful screen shot isn't what shows when I get to that part of the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to copy and paste a screen shot but it doesn't work either with the Control keys or right clicking the mouse. But, when I'm in that part of the settings headed "Choose how updates are installed" there is no option to "Notify to schedule restart".
 All I have is "Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows" and "Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update" and that's it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, in response to the other questions, the OS build is 14393.222, the Version number is 1607 and I have Windows 10 Home 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>So, having just reread the last response to my thread, does that mean that, in this latest update, as an "improvement" in an already bad updating system, that I now have no control on when Windows chooses to download an update and/or install it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so it'll be Mac here I come! :(((</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly astounded that anyone in Microsoft thinks that not being able to schedule updates and install updates when it's convenient to me is a good idea!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there MUST be a way to schedule both the download and the installation as my desktop has Windows 10, and the latest (1607) version number and that restarts in the middle of the night, and NEVER in the day time!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your primary concern is when the installation runs, listen to Gerry's advice.&nbsp; He is very competent.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>With the introduction of Windows 10 Microsoft took away the absolute ability of the user to control the timing of updating of Windows. Many users feel aggrieved at this action. A great deal of pressure has and is being put on Microsoft to restore
 user control. Changes have been made by Microsoft but the current arrangements remain unsatisfactory. I would expect there to be further changes.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are three key problem areas.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. The timing of downloads.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. The timing of automatic restarts to configure downloads, which have been installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. The prevention of downloads and reinstallation of updates known to create severe problems, which have previously removed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Problem area 1 is primarily a problem for users facing limit on download usage.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-networking/manage-internet-data-usage-and-windows-updates-in/5417b89b-4790-4cd9-b854-809862274447"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-networking/manage-internet-data-usage-and-windows-updates-in/5417b89b-4790-4cd9-b854-809862274447</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Problem area 2 seems to be where your complaint lies and you should be able to manipulate the existing arrangements to suit your work schedule and place the automatic&nbsp;restart outside your active hours. Select Settings, Update and security,
<strong>Change active hours</strong>. Set a Start time and an End time and click <strong>
Save</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Problem area 3 does not presently have an acceptable solution, unless the update is a Device driver update. Some editions of Windows 10 can defer Feature Updates for a limited period of time.</span></span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>We have known about automatic updates in Windows 10 since spring 2014. The time for discussion or to be "aggrieved" over it has long since passed. Microsoft has well explained the reasons for it and have been quite adamant that if you do not agree with the
 new policies/terms, you should not use the software. They even go further to note that if you do not comply with the new terms, your license to use the software is invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us face it, the previous controls concerning updates were just an invitation for a great number of users to forgo the updates entirely. This is far too expensive a practice for any of us to want to see continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning your "three key problem areas." There are several, well documented, methods to mitigate the first two and for the well organized user, the internal algorithms even do a fair job of handling them based on the usage patterns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limited data usage issue seems to be somewhat overblown. Nothing I have seen shows a need for bandwidth, concerning updates, that would adversely affect any public provider's offerings. Even checking my own family room PC; It has consumed 65+GB of data
 in the past 30 days - of which, only 1.6GB has been consumed for System usage. The Amazon app, alone,&nbsp;on the family room PC has consumed over 5GB of data in the past 30 days. It would seem that users concerned with data consumption would be remiss in thinking
 updates have much of an effect on their connectivity costs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Number three has been with us since the inception of the PC. It has always been a given that a certain percentage of PC's will be retired with the advent of a new OS. Windows 10 has done a better job of handling old hardware/software combinations, but, there
 will still be some that fail to make the grade due to OEM decisions to drop their support. What is new is that we will be seeing this cycle every four to six months, not every three years. The continual trying to get a failing system to accept the upgrade
 is just as futile as it has been in the past. The fact that out of date installations will no longer be tolerated, underscores the need to know when a system should be retired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That several users of this forum seem to have been caught unaware of impending failure of updates/upgrades is a bit surprising. Every failure that I have seen mentioned by public users had already been noted by the Insider program, months before. Having
 up to six months to mitigate these failures, should, negate any need for seeing multiple "downloads and reinstallation of updates known to create severe problems."</p>
<p>
</p><p>While those of us in the Enterprise/Business sector have the luxury of our testing labs keeping track of what happens to our hardware/software configuration on the Insider builds, there are also consumer grade methods of keeping on top of these things. Most
 OEM support sites are providing lists of products that will or will not survive upcoming updates/upgrades. For the software side of the world, there are things like readyforwindows.com.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just for info:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;is a serious issue for those on limited internet data allowances such as mobile data users &amp; SatComms data users.&nbsp;
<em>I have recently increased my data allowance to 6GB each month between my two computers so that, with careful management,&nbsp;Windows update now only accounts for about 50% of my data usage and 'Modern' Apps updating only accounts for about a further 15%.&nbsp; So
 I get to use about 2GB each month for my own purposes.</em></p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I am also experiencing this same problem. Though Xbox has not changed it's status yet, they are certainly aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. It is an issue with the Xbox Live Servers and nothing on your end. Keep an eye on the forums and the
 status updates for continued information.</p>

            I assume you’re using the Windows 7 backup utility within Windows 10 as the category you posted in is for Windows 10, if this is incorrect I apologise.
<br />Windows backup &amp; maybe in the future file history are being deprecated &amp; will eventually be removed, what you’re experiencing may be related to that. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/w8cookbook/windows-7-backup-and-restore-deprecated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deskto...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend using third party software:
<br />“System Image Backup (SIB) Solution
<br />We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors.”
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034825/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-fall-creators-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403482...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend moving to third party imaging software now before it is removed permanently  if you prefer backing up your PC rather than using File history.
<br />Many users recommend Macrium Reflect free:

<h2>            Cannot get scanner on a multi-function printer working in Windows 7.</h2>
                    Printer/Scanner/Fax is a Canon multifunction printer mf5770.&nbsp; Installed new driver from Canon website and got printer working.&nbsp; But Windows 7 doesn't recognize that&nbsp;the printer is a scanner also.

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>Is the scanner recognized in device manager as Imaging device?<br />
If so, uninstall the current driver that is installed for it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: Uninstall the scanner driver and reinstall it</strong><br />
Here’s how:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Physically disconnect your Canon multifunction printer from your computer. <br />
2.&nbsp;Go to <strong>start</strong> and type <strong>device manager</strong> in the search field.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
4.&nbsp;Locate the scanner, right-click on it and select <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
5.&nbsp;On the <strong>driver</strong> tab, click on <strong>uninstall</strong> to uninstall the driver.<br />
6.&nbsp;Restart the computer.<br />
7.&nbsp;Install the driver from the link <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=11147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=11147</a><br />
8.&nbsp;Do not connect the device until you are prompted to.</p>
<p>Now check if you are able to scan. If you are, then you’re done with the troubleshooting. If you still are unable to scan, go to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Completely uninstall all the Canon softwares installed on the computer and reinstall them.<br />
</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Disconnect the device from computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;Uninstall anything that has canon on the front from programs and features.<br />
To navigate to programs and features, type programs and features in the start search field.<br />
3. Click on canon from the program list and select uninstall.<br />
4.&nbsp;Also delete the Canon folder from Program files directory. If you are unable to delete it from normal mode, you may try deleting the same from safe mode.<br />
<br />
Refer:<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;From the link in step 1, download the software for the device Windows 7.<br />
5.&nbsp;You must install the software first, then reconnect your canon mf5770 device<br />
when prompted to do so and then turn it on.<br />
<br />
See if this brings the scanner to work.<br />
<br />
For additional help with the installation, download the Guides and Manuals provided in the link.
<br />
You may also download the firmware updates for your device from the same link.</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates.&nbsp; This is the setting you will keep.</li><li>You are going to download KB3020369 first.&nbsp; It may tell you it is already installed.&nbsp; If it does, proceed to KB3172605</li><li>For 64 bit Windows Download and install KB302369 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/D/0/5D0821EB-A92D-4CA2-9020-EC41D56B074F/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x64.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Laptop - US Keyboard at pre-boot environment</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have purchased several Surface Laptops for our users (i5, 256GB SSD)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All going swimmingly well until we encrypted the drives with Symantec Encryption Desktop (v10.4.1). The issue being that during the Symantec Encryption pre-boot logon screen, the Surface only recognizes it's keyboard as a US keyboard, even though UK is selected
 within the Symantec Encryption software (we need a UK keyboard!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when using the on-screen keyboard, it is US style and so missing '£'. When plugging in an external USB keyboard, this types as expected (we can change the default keyboard to Uk, French etc and it types as expected.). But with the Surface keyboard,
 it only types as a US keyboard whichever language we have selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once booted into Windows, all is good and the keyboard is set to UK which is what we want/have set as default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed all the latest firmware and drivers (SurfaceLaptop_Win10_15063_1703008_1.msi) but still the issue persists. I've installed using a fresh Windows USB ISO but still no joy. Any suggestions here?! Anyone had similar problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom.</p>

            I think your first step is to contact Symantec since the pre-boot encryption environment is theirs. If they can repro, they should be able to work with Microsoft on this.

<h2>            Recover Retrieve View my single removed message in a contact</h2>
                    Hi, I removed one single message in a chat with a contact in Skype v 7.39.0.102 on my win10<br />
Can I recover, retrieve or view my single removed message?<br />
Already tried to look and searched the Internet: &nbsp;conversation history, main.db, apps viewing the main.db; Skyperious etc but the one single message from my contact shows still removed. Anyone a solution?

            When you delete a message, it's physically deleted from all endpoints. In main.db, the body_xml field for that message is replaced with an empty string and the original text is gone. And there's no undelete feature, I'm afraid.

<h2>            Windows 10 screen turns off after a few minutes of inactivity</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Now on Windows 10 and screen turns itself off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other "turning off" issues I see on the forum but not this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not threatening, just annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my Power Options turned to "Never" on all. &nbsp;Never, not at all, not even a hint of turning anything off. &nbsp;Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the screen turns off after a few minutes of inactivity. &nbsp;Doesn't lock, doesn't shut down, just turns the screen off. &nbsp;Turns on again instantly I move the mouse or hit a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a screen saver set to kick in after 4 minutes (a 3-D text) but that doesn't even get to go, the screen just turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Irritating. &nbsp;If I set a Power Plan, I expect to be in charge of it, not have Microsoft arbitrarily decide for me.</p>

    <title>frequent Ntfs corruption errors &#38; constant networking disruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artgs  say:</h3>
<h2>            frequent Ntfs corruption errors &#38; constant networking disruption &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    My internet connection (WLAN) keeps on being dropped several times a day; disabling and enabling the network adapter usually fixes it temporarily; however, the message is always the same:<b> the default gateway is unavailable</b>. Could this be related
 to the Nfts errors that appear repeatedly in the Event logs? The error reads either something like<br />
<br />
<b>'A corruption was discovered in the file system structure on volume Packard Bell.<br />
<br />
A corruption was found in a file system index structure.&nbsp; The file reference number is 0x110000000250ba.&nbsp; The name of the file is "\Windows".&nbsp; The corrupted index attribute is ":$I30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION".'</b><br />
<br />
or like<br />
'<b>The default transaction resource manager on volume \\?\Volume{da096ae3-6b88-4a83-bd0e-a56048c39a2b} encountered a non-retryable error and could not start.&nbsp; The data contains the error code</b>.'<br />
<br />
I discovered these errors while troubleshooting a major disruption - neither the WLAN nor the ethernet connection worked for hours (the router is fine; I can connect to it via other devices). In my desperate efforts to check everything, I went through the Event
 Viewer and noticed that Ntfs errors crop up too frequently, given that this is a new machine.<br />
<br />
In this case, running <b>chkdsk/r</b> via the command prompt eventually restored the internet connection - everything else (uninstalling and re-installing the adapter, resetting the router, flushing the DNS cache, checking for malware, using system restore
 etc.), but the connection is still dropped frequently and I'm concerned that there's something fundamentally wrong in the system files.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            Hello, and many thanks for your response. In the meantime (i.e. before I read your reply), the same error occurred, and this time nothing seemed to help. Here's a list of what I tried to no avail:<br />

</li><li>CMD: ipconfig/flushDNS &amp; /registerDNS</li><li>CMD: tried to ping host (no response) <br />
</li><li>checked for malware (two programmes, no threat found) <br />
</li><li>Windows recovery options: chose automatic repair (message: Windows could not repair system). Loaded properly but still no connection
<br />
</li><li>loaded Windows from USB: loaded properly but no connection <br />
</li><li>system restore to a point where connectivity was dropped but could be resumed via resetting the adapter</li><li>refresh the PC</li><li>reset the PC to factory workings - basically, reinstall everything from scratch: the system was rolled back to Windows 8 and I did not re-install the upgrade to 8.1. Connectivity was problematic in both 8 and 8.1</li></ul>
<br />
Although my mobile connects with no problems to my router and network, I tried connecting the (reset to Windows 8) laptop to a different router and network - and was completely baffled when it connected right away. The connection has not been dropped for about
 an hour now.<br />
<br />
I'd already kept a record of the log in the Event Viewer, which I will try to copy below. A key point is that the laptop is refurbished by the manufacturer. In the Event Viewer I discovered that the machine had presented related problems some months before
 I bought it, which suggests that the problem is not new. <br />
Confusingly, it is impossible for me to pin down the problem and conclude whether the fault lies with the laptop's own software, Windows 8.1, the router, or the network adapter, since the laptop was able to connect to the internet for a while, albeit with problems,
 and the router and network work fine with my mobile.<br />
<br />
Here's an excerpt from the Events log:<br />

            *Update*<br />
<br />
The connection to the second router lasted for about 3 hours. After that, the same problems that I've always had with this laptop started recurring: although the PC remained connected (via WLAN) to the network, the connection to&nbsp; the internet was dropped every
 so often. The reported problem: 'the default gateway is not available'. This was fixed temporarily by the troubleshooter. This is the third router I've tried ever since I bought this laptop, and the same problems are replicated in all cases. The most extreme
 problems (after about 3 months of use) are reported in my first message.<br />
<br />
I'd be very grateful for an expert opinion on whether this has to do with some faulty .dll, the network card, Windows 8, or some other problem.<br />
<br />
A list of 'events' in the last hour (below) shows that the main issue is connectivity:
<br />
<b>All&nbsp; Dhcp-Client events are identical:</b><br />

 address (DHCP) server.'<br />

            Hello and thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I checked with the manufacturer and they deem the error to lie with the software, which the guarantee doesn't cover; they basically imply that there's a fault in Windows. Judging from the range of computer makes that present similar problems
 under Windows 8 and 8.1, as users report in various forums, the manufacturer's technical support might be right.
<br />
<br />
At any rate, I will forward your recommendation and, once I've made some progress with the problem, I'll post an update here for anyone who might be facing similar issues.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did. <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/the-default-gateway-is-not-available-and/c3c056bc-a535-4988-bf32-b6893292e61f">
Here's a detailed overview</a> of how I went about tackling the issue, and what my (non-expert!) interim conclusions are. In addition to the list of failed attempts I've copied from this thread, you'll find one solution that partly worked for me: the Windows
 8 laptop now connects steadily to the internet via one router but not via my own router; I'm still waiting for my ISP to help me sort out that issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell, the fact that so many users experience very similar problems (the well-known "default gateway" error) that appear to have related but distinct causes and, for the lucky ones, different solutions indicates that the design of Windows 8 is indeed
 flawed when it comes to connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do try out <em>Complete Internet Repair</em>, make sure that you heed the software's own warnings. Personally, I did not experiment with any solutions that the programme warned might be tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and please post back if you get anywhere.</p>

<p>If a game supports local co-op (multiplayer splitscreen), then you can sign into both accounts and place. As far as I'm aware, Destiny only has online multiplayer, not local. So you would not be able to play it at the same time.</p>

<p>That's correct,</p>
<p>Games that do not support Local Co-Op will not show you your sons gamertag in the local campaign lobby. However playing online it will. When you are in the multiplayer lobby you should see beneath your own gamertag something like 'Press A to join' (for the
 second controller) just simply sign the second controller in with the other account and start enjoying some multiplayer fun!</p>
<p>How are you finding Destiny so far? I haven't had a chance to get it yet, I've too many games to play currently but I am a bit intrigued. I did play the BETA but it wasn't really giving much away I thought.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            The answer is in the first reply. Clean boot is going to be the only way to know which app it is. Sangeeta described the process and provided a link to a step by step guide. It may be a quick process or it could be long and tedious. It depends on how many
 apps you have installed and if you luck out in eliminating it in a couple clean boots or not. It could take several tries to get the right one.

<p>I am experiencing the same problem and share the OP's concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the expectation of a "Hey, an app wants to modify your system!" error containing which app is doing the modifying is a reasonable one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alert gives me a choice to either download and install the feature, or to skip it. Why doesn't the alert give me the means to make that informed decision?</p>

</p><p>To be fair, not this post nor the post by Sangeeta provided the critical information that CasualTrash asked. This should be along the lines: perform a clean boot and then, for each app and service: enable it again and reboot, until you find the offending
 one. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Clearly Windows knows which app is causing the problem.</p>
<p>For some reason it doesn't bother to tell us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if it is determined that we are so incompetent as to not be able to use the name of the app, it would be nice to have the option to turn of the 'annoyance-ware' of being asked to install .NET every time we start windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to be able to have a way to turn this off without doing 100 or so clean boots, even if it means that there is an app that cannot run.</p>

            <p>You might try using schtasks from the command line. Then look through the list to see if anything is older that you no longer need. You could probably write a short script to look at the file date or attempt to execute the file and see which causes the system
 dialog to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feel is that it will likely be bloatware that came with the computer or a device you've added. It might also be a shareware tool you installed that you rarely use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to detect what is using the older .net framework is to look for a process called "fondue.exe" in your tasklist using SysInternals Process Explorer and look at the "current directory" for that process. The culprit on my machine was the Lenovo
 Solution Center.</p>

            <p>This is not very helpful, installing another OS will make the message go away. You will not have the same OS next week anyways, since Microsoft commandeers windows 10 workstations now without consent and takes 3 hours to replace the entire OS every time
 they get a new idea. They could care less about the work users are trying to perform on platforms using their OS.</p>

            <p>Hello Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SyncToy 2.1 is a free application that synchronizes files and folders between locations. Typical uses include sharing files, such as photos, with other computers and creating backup copies of files and folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Why are you trying to uninstall SyncToy 2.1?</li><li>What do you mean when you say Work files, registry entries, and the program?</li><li>Are you afraid of deletion of synced files by SyncToy application?</li></ol>
<p>If you will uninstall the application from the&nbsp;program list in Control panel, it will remove that application from your system. But to be in safer side I would suggest you to have a back up of all these files on an external media and for that you may refer
 to the article mentioned below.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first updated to the creators update through the insider program I discovered that my audio stopped working so after playing around a bit I uninstalled the realtek driver and have been running the built in Microsoft audio driver ever since and I was
 wondering whether or not it would be advisable to reinstall the realtek driver or leave my audio as it is currently. I am currently running build 15063.483.&nbsp;</p>
