            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

<h3> droid0196  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t restore default HP BIOS POST boot logo after attempting to add some personal flair to the POST screen on my HP Compaq 6735S.</h2>
                    I tried to make looking at the POST screen less boring by replacing the boot logo with that of a popular television show [please don't ask which one], but it failed. Instead of seeing the new logo, I saw nothing but text that reads "For boot options, press
 F10." Even after I tried to restore the default HP logo, there continues to be nothing at all on the POST screen except for the aforementioned text. At least I can still boot to Windows. The only reason I came here for help instead of running to HP is because
 I'm tired of them giving me flack about the kinds of stuff I do with my 6735S, which is why the category is pretty out of place for this kind of question, [but at least they weren't trying to be rude about it... I think. For instance: they tried to tell me
 that Windows 8.1 isn't supported on this model. I politely tried to convince them that they're wrong.] Anyway, I tried all I could to restore the default BIOS POST boot logo, like entering eRepLogo.efi /e [which supposedly erases the custom boot logo and restores
 the default one], but that just didn't work for me. As long as the computer still functions, I suppose that's fine, but I still want to restore that boot logo. If it helps, I run Windows 7, 8.1, and Server 2012 R2 and always keep all three up to date with
 the latest Windows updates and patches. [Yes, HP--they're all compatible... even Server...]<br />

            I'm well aware that Microsoft doesn't set the logos; I just wanted to see if anyone here knew anything about how to change back to the default POST boot logo.

<h2>            Game Won&#39;t Install</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all. I tried to install Fallout 3 from the disc to an external hdd that is fat32 formatted with 15.9 GB available. It gave me a performance message which I acknowledged and attempted to install the game. It'll get to 8% before displaying a disc-read
 error message. The funny part is that the game is near scratchless and plays near perfectly while in the disc tray so the lens and disc are fine. Admittedly, the hdd I'm using is older but works fine when hooked via usb to my pc. Am I missing something or
 is there no way for the hdd to work?</p>

<p>Hard Drives are labeled as if 1 GB was 1000 MB, but it's really 1024. If your drive says it's 100 GB, it's really only 95.4 GB. On top of that, some of that is lost to system files. But the 360 can only use 16 gb of any external drive.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Do other games install to this drive ok? Will fallout install to the 360's hard drive ok?</p>

<p>No other games have been able to install either. I'm thinking the hdd is bad but it works on the computer so I'm just a bit confused. It has the proper format to be recognized by the console and if nothing else has around 15.9 GB free which is more than
 enough for one game installation. I have the 4GB model so the hdd bay is empty. It's an external usb hdd I'm using which may be the problem??</p>

<p>So the 360 recognizes it just fine, but games won't install? Have you tried formatting it on the 360 itself? Also, do game saves work from the drive? Will music or video content play on the 360 from the drive?</p>

<p>The 360 prompted me to format upon plugging it in. I haven't moved any copies of save files to the drive but so far videos work from it. I tried to download from Zune to it and it didn't ask where I wanted to save the video, but when I moved it to the drive
 it worked during playback flawlessly, no lag or freezing experienced. I'm assuming if the video worked that music will as well.</p>

<p>The performance warning you received is normal for external hard drives.&nbsp; The test is a measure of the access&nbsp;time as well as read/writing ability, since hard drives have a slower access speed than flash drives you'll always get this warning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any flash drives you could try?&nbsp; Fallout 3 without any additional DLC requires 5.5GB while the GOTY version requires 7.7GB.&nbsp; So you'll need a 8GB flash drive minimum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this game&nbsp;or&nbsp;any&nbsp;other&nbsp;won't install to the flash drive and&nbsp;they are not&nbsp;scratched your consoles DVD drive could be faulty.</p>

<p>Did you get an update for your xbox yet? If you received the update, you are good to go and can use it. If you are still using the old dashboard, it will disable xbox live until you receive the update. Make sure your console has been updated before you play
 it. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Realtek Drivers Sounds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithlx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Realtek Drivers Sounds</h2>
                    <p>Greg,</p>
<p>Hello again. I'm sorry to bugg you about the issues i'm confronting on my new computer with Realtek Drivers for the sounds that for the speakers i have, i am just not too content with the performance. Since it's not 30 days old (computer) i was thinking
 i might try to exchange or see if there's other computers that can play louder or generate the bass that the Pro media 2.1 klipsch speakers that are known for Bass....to see if i can get a computer that will play it because this isn't even or i'm not getting
 out of it what I am Paying for and i joined that Geek Squad per the sales person at BB and i didn't really think i wanted to but i went ahead as she was pretty good sales person and if anything, i just feel a little akward to call on them because i don't think
 they'll be too compassionate for what I'm wanting to have better sound quality and if anything, the windows Realtek driver per Lenovo comes back with this (R) audio is how Driver appears where it used to be High Def. Realtek and maybe that's the latest greatest
 for whatever, but i'm allowing the automation to fulfill updating the computer's requirements and thus far, i'm not impressed with the sound performance and i just thought i would ask you but you pretty much have laid out fine details earlier-on and i didn't
 want to repeat my questioning but there's not a lot of forums on the internet about sound issues i noticed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, take it easy and thanks for any input and your past help was wonderful!</p>

            Hi KeithLX
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Sounds like the monitor is failing. Check your connections to be sure they are connected properly.</p>

            That is a fairly common problem on laptops due to your wrist or palm touching the touchpad while you are typing.&nbsp; You can change the sensitivity settings on the touchpad or in my case, turn it off completely and use a wireless mouse instead.&nbsp; How you make
 either of those changes will depend on the brand and model of the laptop.<br />

<h2>            Error&#58; Windows explorer has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>"Hello"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a problem on My Computer&nbsp; -&nbsp; I am getting this message:&nbsp;&nbsp; `Windows Explorer has stopped working`.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Premium and Internet Explorer 9&nbsp; -&nbsp; which I have had NO Problems with for approximately 2 Years [?]&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently Installed Windows Update - Service Pack 1&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after that - but NOT immediately I had this problem&nbsp; -&nbsp; I mention this because it was the ONLY Change to My Computer recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked online for an answer on how to Repair Windows Explorer but I could not find an answer that I could even understand&nbsp; -&nbsp; let alone carry out the Instructions&nbsp; -&nbsp; also what I was reading seemed to be `Computer Experts` writing to each other in&nbsp;
 `Computer Speak`&nbsp; -&nbsp; I did not understand any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping that there will be a Simple Process that I can carry out to Repair Windows Explorer&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don`t really want to Restore My Computer to a previous time&nbsp; -&nbsp; unfortunately My latest Back Up is from December 2011&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; I don`t want to lose Emails [Hundreds] that I have stored in My Windows Live Mail Program since December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that someone can help Me&nbsp; -&nbsp; Although I am VERY Inexperienced in Computing and I would need `Step by Step` Instructions Please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Explorer :stopped working" can be caused by many things, including software conflict, or a file in the OS becoming corrupted.<br />
<br />
The easiet way to install it is probably to do a repair install from the win 7 dvd.&nbsp; It only "affects" the OS files so your data should be safe.<br />
<br />
One way to further test this is to run a "system file check" to verify and hopefull repair the Operating system files.&nbsp; It is built into win 7
<br />

            <p>"Hello Ken",</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You very much for your reply and your suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try the System File Check first and then if necessary try to work out how to use the Windows 7 Home Premium [`Upgrade Disc`] to repair the Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one question about using the Windows 7 Upgrade Disc:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Disc is an `Upgrade Disc` from Windows Vista TO Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp; -&nbsp; as I purchased My Computer at about the same time that Windows 7 was being released I was entitled to an Upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 which I obtained on an `Upgrade Disc`&nbsp;
 -&nbsp; A Legal Version from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will this Upgrade Disc still be O.K. to use to try and Repair the Windows Explorer ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won`t be able to let You know how I got on until late in the Week / the Weekend as I have at least&nbsp;3 Very busy Days on Tuesday&nbsp;- &nbsp;Wednesday and Thursday&nbsp; -&nbsp; I hope that You won`t mind that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You very much for your help with this Ken&nbsp; -&nbsp; I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            System file check will return one of three answers at the end.<br />
<br />
1-didnt find any access violations (good)<br />
<br />
2-found errors but was able to fix them (good)<br />
<br />
3-Found errors but was unable to fix them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the one that should be fixed with a rapair install.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe (but am not certain) that an upgrade disk can be used for a repair install.<br />
<br />
<br />
My pleasure Chris.&nbsp; I have been there myself.<br />

<p>Sorry to be a nuisance but when I use the Link that You posted for the Instructions for the System File Checker I was just directed to the Sevenforums webpage where there was a LOT of different Topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I could not Register / Sign in to use the Search Function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there another way that I can access the Instructions that you very kindly suggested ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Ok lets try this<br />
<br />
<br />
Run a system file check to verify and repair your system files.<br />
<br />
start&gt;search&gt;right click and run as admin&gt;sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
It may need to be run up to three times before successful<br />
Let us know the results from the report at the end<br />

<p>I seem to have found further problems regarding System File Checker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After writing My previous reply to You about not knowing how to Access the System File Checker I found&nbsp; sfc.exe&nbsp; -&nbsp; I Rght clicked onto it and Clicked onto Run as Administrator -&nbsp; this brought up the Microsoft Permission Box [ Allow program to make changes
 to your Computer]&nbsp; -&nbsp; when I selected `Agree`&nbsp; a&nbsp; Black Box&nbsp; Flashed Up on the Computer Screen and Vanished&nbsp; -&nbsp; Nothing was showing on the Bottom Bar of my Computer as a Program that was running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not see ANY Sign of any Scanner / Program running&nbsp; -&nbsp; I tried this 4 times&nbsp; - same result each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am REALLY Sorry if this is now becoming a Nuisance to You&nbsp; -&nbsp; I don`t have ANY Computer Expertise regarding knowing why this would happen&nbsp; -&nbsp; But I think that I did carry out the correct sequence in order to Run the System File Checker -&nbsp; As Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could You suggest what might have caused this to happen&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your Help with this&nbsp; -&nbsp; I will NEVER be able to work this out on My own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi CHRISMUR,</p>
<p>The following link has good instructions on running the System File Checker - follow Option 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html</a></p>
<p>Also, can you check here?</p>
<p>Start &gt; type<em> view all problem reports</em> in the "Search programs and files" box and press "Enter" on the keyboard</p>
<p>Then double-click on a "Windows Explorer" "Stopped Working" error</p>
<p>On the bottom is a "Copy to clipboard" link.</p>
<p>Can you paste that information here?</p>
<p>Then try another "Windows Explorer" "Stopped Working" error and paste the information here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello auggy",</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You very much for your help&nbsp; -&nbsp; and Thanks for the Link to the sfc/scannow.</p>
<p>I did manage to Run it&nbsp; -&nbsp; But I got the Result Message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations`</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the Windows Explorer stopped working Error&nbsp; -&nbsp; I used what You wrote to access the `View all problem reports`&nbsp; -&nbsp; Although I have had MANY instances recently where I got the Message Box on screen that showed&nbsp; `Windows Explorer has stopped working`
 there was only ONE Problem Report about that which was from May 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to get those Error Details onto the Clipboard [In Paint] by using the Snipping Tool - something entirely New to Me&nbsp; -&nbsp; But I don`t know how to then Paste it to here&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the `Normal` Copy &amp; Paste but it did not Attach when I submitted this message the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea why the probably 50 or more recent Messages about Windows Explorer has stopped working would NOT be in the Problem Reports&nbsp;?&nbsp; -&nbsp; although when this happens the Message then goes to `Windows Explorer is restarting`.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I Right Click again onto something I get the same Messages each time&nbsp; -&nbsp; this would just keep on happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I know nothing about Computing I am at a complete loss about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            We have restarted the computer and yes that is the screen when we log back in. Both mouse and laptop keyboard are responding. and the computer is a Toshiba Satalite not sure on the tablet mode.

            the problem started when i transfered the hard drive from the same model of computer to the next then it says that it is not an active version. so because it isnt an active version i cant personalize anything but there should be a way to use the keyboard
 keys to change it out of the tablet mode or am i wrong.

<p>From what I have been reading on-line about this issue, it seems like most posters have suggested to try and go through the single player again see if it will unlock this time around. Also, I read that you can do it co-op and still earn the armor.</p>
<p>You can also&nbsp;Look at your commendations (under Player) and see what you're missing.&nbsp;No changing skulls, no starting from rally points</p>

<p>are you talking about the platinum chief armor? Last i checked, you never actually got the armor for any achievement, you recieve the platinum helmet for getting the achievement "wake up john" but the actual armor, the body pieces..you need to buy in order
 to obtain, case and point..i have not completed it on legendary but i have the platinum body armor</p>

<p>Was you on xbox live all the time when doing halo 4 on legendary? If not then the game has not registered your progress meaning you will have to do the level again which you have done when offline to unlock the armor. You can see which missions you have
 done on your commendations. The one you will be looking for is the commendation "Player" then "Campaign" this will tell you which ones you have done and which ones that have not be registered.</p>
<p>Hope this helps and good luck my friend :) </p>

    <title>Moving Quantum Break for Windows 10 to another HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzn6jw111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Quantum Break for Windows 10 to another HDD</h2>
                    
<p>I received the Windows 10 copy of Quantum Break last night. However, there was no option as to where the game would be installed. I do not have any games installed on my C: drive - they're all installed on my faster, larger E: drive.</p>

<p>The game really isn't playable on my C: drive because of AdWare/Firewall programs receiving updates and other Windows System applications accessing the drive (the game stutters or halts for these operations). That's the main reason, other than my C: drive
 being slower RPM-wise than my E: drive, that games aren't stored there.</p>

<p>Is there any way to move the game off the C: drive to my Games drive?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Apparently, Quantum Break for Windows 10 (the FREE version if you pre-ordered the game for XBoxOne) can ONLY be run as an APP, not a stand-alone game. What a load of crap. Don't know if this is true if you purchase the game for Win 10 separately from the
 Windows store but I wouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>Since it runs like CRAP on my SYSTEM drive, I'm going to have to delete it. What a waste of money!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Second monitor does not keep primary setting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anothersmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second monitor does not keep primary setting</h2>
                    Everytime the computer boots up from hibernate, cold starts or&nbsp;restarts, it puts the primary display back onto the laptop&nbsp;monitor.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I recently purchased a Dell 1730 with Vista SP1 already installed.&nbsp; I attached an ACER AL2116w 24" LCD monitor to it.&nbsp; I set it up in the dispaly settings for 2 monitors and set the ACER as the primary.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went into the NVIDIA control panel to&nbsp;ensure the monitor
 settings were the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer has the newest drivers from NVIDIA installed.<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hello Anothersmith,<br />
<br />
Here are some suggestions that might help. Got this hint from a friend, I have not tried it myself but hopefully it will help to resolve your issue. You have to trick the machine by 1st disabling the original primary monitor (as if you only had the 2nd monitor).
 Depending on the laptop make, there are some<span>&nbsp; </span>keys<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>or a function<span>&nbsp; </span>key<span>&nbsp;
</span>that you could use to send the screen to an external monitor. Hopefully this would shut off the screen on your laptop (goes totally black on the laptop) and everything appears on the external monitor, since it is the only monitor and now primary. Then
 on this working external monitor, go to <strong>Star</strong>t&gt; <strong>
Control Panel</strong>&gt; <strong>Displa</strong>y&gt;<strong>Settings</strong>&gt;, highlight the grayed out non-working #2 monitor, check the box to "extend my windows desktop onto this monitor", then hit "ok". The 2nd monitor should now be your
 secondary monitor with the "primary monitor" being the external monitor. </span>

<h2>            WiFi doesn&#39;t have valid Ip configuration</h2>
                    <p>This morning I upgraded my HP Pavilion 15 laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. &nbsp;Subsequently, I have been unable to connect to the internet. &nbsp;When connecting over wifi, I can connect to the network, but it says the connection is limited. &nbsp;Troubleshooting
 says that '"WiFi" doesn't have a valid IP configuration'. &nbsp;When connecting over ethernet, it does the same but says '"Ethernet" doesn't have a valid IP configuration'. &nbsp;I don't think the problem is with the connection as all other devices in the house are
 accessing the internet as normal, both over wifi and ethernet. &nbsp;I have already tried rebooting the laptop, but beyond that I don't know what else I can do.</p>
<p>

 a virus man, it started with my ethernet port and i thought, "that's fine i'll just use my wifi port then" now this is infected. great. just great.&nbsp;

            <p>Your post is less than helpful, if I uninstall it how do I getit back without the internet. Secondly this has become an issue with Windows 10, that the aforementioned solution has not worked for.</p>

            <p>Not sure what the display adapter would have to do with it.&nbsp; I am having same issue very time I access a new network, as in between home and work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can solve it each time by opening a command prompt window (admin) and running ipconfig /release followed by ipconfig /renew which fixes it every time HOWEVER I should not have to do this each and every time,</p>

<p>Hi Guys, I managed to solve this for me. The issue is that Win10 sets the default WiFi as a Public "do not share" network. You need to reset it as a Private network in the Network &amp; Sharing Centre. Then check all the settings for Public &amp; Private networks
 plus the general setting. Regards, Trevor FS</p>

            I am having the same problem. I have a Dell XPS 13. Network's working fine for a week and then this. Restarting and resetting the computer or the router doesn't help.

    <title>Issue with recent Flash Player update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffwohnsiedler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with recent Flash Player update</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have 2 HP notebook computers, plus my work computer (an HP notebook also) and my girlfriends Dell desktop computer, all with Windows 10 installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I Have an HP Officejet 4500 Wireless (G510n-z) All in One installed on my 2 HP notebooks and my girlfriends Dell Desktop. My work HP notebook has an
 HP Photosmart C6380 All-in-One Printer (CD028A) installed on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My problem is:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft released Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3132372). (My older HP notebook
 is 32 bit but it got a 32 bit update for the same.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems that that Adobe Flash Player update has screwed up both All in One software interfaces. (Both my Officejet 4500 AND the work Photosmart C6380).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I try to open either of their interfaces, the initial screen just flashes on the monitor but goes right back off.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My question is: Does Microsoft have a file to download to fix both of the all in one software interfaces?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for any help.</span></span></p>

    <title>Home Prem. Wont update - 8024402F - Failed to validate cab file digest - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbowers84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home Prem. Wont update - 8024402F - Failed to validate cab file digest downloaded from .... download.windowsupdate.com&#47;....</h2>
                    Brand new install of Windows 7 Home Premium... ran some updates then windows update stopped working.<br />
<br />
Log shows its failing to get the correct digest for some file - I've manually downloaded the cab however I don't know if I can manually install it too?<br />
<br />
Internet is fine - every other system on our network updates perfectly fine. Done all the normal fixes such as reboot, got new IP from DHCP, etc. The manual downloading of the file seems to indicate this isn't an network issue.<br />

            Hi UnderPlayer, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Are you getting an error message or code when it attempts to launch? Can you describe what happens when it attempts to launch? Since you didn't have a hard drive previously, what media did you have GTA San Andreas on? Is the game still located on this media
 or is it now on the hard drive that was purchased? Any clarification on these questions should assist in helping resolve the problem for you.</p>

<p>The hard drive would be the issue then. About 99% of hard drives purchased from ebay or from third party companies are usually knock offs and will not work with original Xbox games. You would have to purchase a brand new hard drive from a retailer to make
 sure it's an official MS brand hard drive that will work with the game.</p>

<p>Have tried the above suggestion and still tells me to download again! - thanks for your help but think I might need to bite the bullet and buy an "Official" Hard Drive and put losing £30 down to experience :-(</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reservation Application Error</h2>
                    <p>I installed the windows update and the reservation icon appeared.&nbsp; I reserved and put in my email.&nbsp; I received an email confirmation and the device and application listing shows no compatibility issues.&nbsp; However I have started getting a GWXUX error when
 I start my PC.&nbsp; It is interesting as the application still appears to be working?&nbsp; I have removed the patch and reinstalled it.&nbsp; Error came back after reinstallation.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most ntdll.dll errors result from a corrupt or damaged version of the ntdll.dll file itself, corrupt hardware drivers, or issues between Windows and other programs. -about.com-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have access to a Working Windows 7 unit that is similar to your Windows 7 unit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try copying ntdll.dll from the working computer and replace it on your computer.&nbsp;
</p>
