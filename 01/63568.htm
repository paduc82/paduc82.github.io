<p>Yeah, dude. I can't even make it through the loading screen with my main character. I'm trying to narrow it down as to what it could it be. It doesn't look like anyone else is having the same problem as me. If I try to join GTAO with my main as my last played,
 I get the infinite loading screen. If I join with my secondary or switch character through the single player menu, I can play. I can see my character in the menu, I just can't use it.

<p>this issue has been going on for over two weeks now. I have been scowering the web for solutions but havent yet found one. Is there anybody out there that has a solution? Can you please help me?</p>

            <p>Hi Sandeep,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, all of these steps have already been done without solving the issue..</p>
<p>Method 1) You cannot run windows experience index in safe mode. see also step 1 from the orignal message.</p>
<p>Method&nbsp;2)&nbsp; Windows Areo trouble shooter reports faulty information...</p>
<p>...windows Aero trouble shooting...</p>
<p>the Microsoft Fix It reports..</p>
<p>Issues found - Video card doesn't support required display settings - Install an Aero-compatible video card</p>
<p>Issues found - Video card doesn't support required display settings - Your video card doesnt support DirectX 9.0 or higher, Pixel Shader Model 2.0 or higher, or doesn't have sufficient memory bandwidth required to display Aero effects such as transparency.<br />
&nbsp;Collection information:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Name: HOST01<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Version: 6.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Architecture: amd64<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time: 12/18/2011 12:27:14 PM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The card this machine is using is an EVGA GTX 550 Ti w/ 1Gb video ram, this card uses DirectX 11, this card was purchased because of this issue, I originally thought the GTS 250 w/ 1Gb video ram and running DirectX 10 went bad.. apparenty the GTS 250 card
 wasnt bad and the issue is due to something else.</p>
<p>Also the architecture of this PC is not amd64, its a pure intel machine mother board and cpu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3) All drivers are downloaded from the manufacturer and are the latest provided for this graphics card. I have also tried lettings windows update install drivers which also did not reolve the issue. see also steps 4,5 and 6 from the orignal message.</p>
<p>Please also note that this machine is currently running with windows aero theme, no problems occur until I run the windows experience index (which is&nbsp;reporting that&nbsp;I have new hardware and need to refresh the index) or if I game TF2, L4D2, Killing Floor,
 CODMW2, etc. Furthermore no errors are reported. The machine just shuts off and starts the reboot cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas....?</p>

            <p>Try to do this OFFLINE but DOWNLOAD these FILES FIRST:</p>
<p>Perform clean install of Windows,</p>
<p>Let Windows automatically detect and install your Graphics Card, wait for successful message below the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>install updated driver of GTX550 Ti </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-32bit-285.62-whql-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-32bit-285.62-whql-driver.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>plus this service pack</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21766</a></p>
<p>you may want to download this first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Microsoft Security Essentials anti-virus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5201</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all installed connect online.</p>
<p>coz we're trying to single out if any of those Microsoft Updates that came in AFTER the Service Pack above that may be causing it. If any Updates from Microsoft Update saying they have latest version of VGA driver, ignore it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off Automatic Updates and leave MS Security Essentials running and updated.</p>
<p>Then run WEI then after that games TF2, L4D2, Killing Floor, CODMW2, etc. on-line (GAMES in Highest Graphics)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If successful install Microsoft Updates month by month until the time you remember it failed with your old card. Pls still ignore VGA card driver offered by them.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Ok, as you suggeted I have reformated and reinstalled windows. My windows Vista installation disk is a later release and includes service pack 1. So I made sure no further automatic(or manual) updates were installed.&nbsp; I then installed the video card driver(the
 64bit version, not the 32 bit verion) (I only mention this because of the deviation from the&nbsp;specifics of your instructions). The next thing I did at this stage was to run the windows experience index ... the same result occured. The machine shut off without
 error message, then went into the restart cycle. At this point it became fairly obvious that this is not a software or O.S. issue, but, to make sure (for the sake of my own sanity)... I phoned the tech support dept. of my video cards' manufacturer. It was
 the oppinion of the support tech and myself, that the issue is rooted in a fault on the motherboards PCIe channel. The issue only occured when the channel was being fully utilized.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My next step in resolving this issue is to get a new motheboard,install it, and finally verify that the issue is in fact resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank you very much for your persistence in helping me trouble-shoot this issue. You sir are a value to this community. Out of all the people that actully get paid to do this, you were the only person to logically determine and communicate any
 actions of value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will mark this thread as resolved as soon as I receive and install the new motherboard and see the WEI run successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issues persists. New motherboard, new video card, new power supply, all the suggested steps taken. This is a software issue introduced by microsoft or one of the hardware vendors and everyone is pointing fingers as opposed to taking valid trouble-shooting
 steps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>New board, new video card, Windows is not downloading any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could only mean one thing, the latest driver provided by Nvidia is faulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the&nbsp;update before the&nbsp;latest driver provided by Nvidia and don't download any Microsoft updates, just the two files (Service pack and Anti-virus) as I've mentioned earlier&nbsp;to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Avg Watchdog Service Stopping After Multiple Crashes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Avg Watchdog Service Stopping After Multiple Crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, about 2 days ago, my laptop had the recent updates done for Windows 10 and after those updates, it has been constantly freezing my computer and causing it to crash. At first I let it be but after 3 hours of it being frozen, I had to force it to
 shut down. After rebooting, the same thing kept happening when ever i tried to open a web browser, view documents, etc. I tryed unpluging all of my peripherals and deleting all USB drivers, then updating them. I then restarted the computer and the problem
 persisted. After multiple failed attempts to get my computer to run normally i shut it down and took out the battery for 60 seconds to let the hardware reset properly and i plugged it back in. It started working normally, but after a few minutes, the freezing
 returned. I tried restarting it one more time without anything plugged into the computer and a message popped up. It is in the image. After each forced shutdown, and reboot, this message keeps popping up and it just sits there. I cannot enter safemode either.&nbsp;Can
 anyone explain whats happening to my laptop?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f27c77b-8b5d-4a7d-aab8-04a35ad228b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f27c77b-8b5d-4a7d-aab8-04a35ad228b3" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* UPDATE *&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I shut down the computer and took out the battery and rebooted. I was able to sign in and everything seemed to be fine, but the crashing has gotten drastically worse and i cannot even start applications or open anyweb browsers any more. As soon as i try
 to open something, the computer freezes and becomes unoperable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Chris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling the lock screen in Windows 10 can be facilitated by performing changes in the registry of your device as well as editing user account settings. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The edition, version, and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li><li>If your device is managed by a domain or an organization. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest approach would be to remove the existing password that your account is using. If you're using a local account, you can perform the steps posted under the To remove an existing password from a local account section of this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14064/windows-8-sign-in-to-windows-without-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If you're using a Microsoft account, you'd need to switch to a local account to facilitate your request. The link will also provide the steps to complete this.</p>

    <title>Creating a desktop shortcut to a drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim giglio 81 - gmail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a desktop shortcut to a drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a floppy that connects to the PC by USB, with a desktop shortcut that gave me quick access to the drive contents. A few days ago when&nbsp; booted up, the icon had vanished, I have no idea why, but I thought I had a way to get it back. I went to "Devices
 and Printers" in the control&nbsp; panel, right-clicked on the image of the floppy and selected "create shortcut from the drop-down&nbsp; menu that popped up. The icon appeared, and I put it back in the space formerly occupied by the missing icon. But when I clicked
 on the icon, it displayed the "Properties" window instead of the files stored on the floppy. I also discovered, when I brought up Windows Explorer, that right-clicking the "A" drive did NOT offer me a way to create the icon I was used to. Examining the "properties"
 display for the floppy icon, I found that the icon's target is the control panel "Devices &amp; Printers" display.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) What made the floppy icon disappear in the first place?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) How do I recover the icon that reveals the files on the floppy when I click on it?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Thanks for the responses. I fund the answer to creating icons for drives with my old friend GOOGLE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It turns out that all I have to do is click on the drive letter with Windows Explorer,&nbsp; look to the tiny icon in the address bar, and then drag it to the desktop.</p>

    <title>IDT High Definition Audio CODEC Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gene64  say:</h3>
<h2>            IDT High Definition Audio CODEC Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I currently cannot receive audio nor input audio. The only way I am able to hear is during the "Playing Audio" troubleshooter, I usually just leave that open while I'm on my PC so I can hear. With my "Rear Mic" (also IDT High Definition Audio CODEC),
 it says "Currently unavailable" in the sound settings. How to fix both of these problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Gene</p>

</p><p>EDIT: My computer model is h8-1380t with beats audio manager.</p>

    <title>No Sign in option when the windows starts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mukulaggarwal  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sign in option when the windows starts.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Win 10 as a pre-installed OS in my laptop(14/10/2015). When the windows starts,I used to sign in with the PIN that i created. It also used to show the sign in option so if one wishes to sign in with the Microsoft account password, he/she can do
 so.</p>
<p>But recently i'm facing a problem by which i'm not given a option to sign in.I have to enter my Microsoft account password only with no facility to sign in with my PIN.&nbsp;<br />
The sign in option button on the window startup page is also not there which was used to be there.<br />
Need a help with this issue.</p>
<p />

            <p>First of all thank you atleast replying. Now coming to the point.I really don't know how much understanding do you have of my question. If I'm saying that I am not seeing a sign in option with PIN, it becomes quite obvious that i have a PIN. There's absolutely
 no need to add another PIN.There has to be some other way. It is really pissing me off.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstalled the driver, did you install the original VX-6000 software or just install and uninstall from device manager? You may need to reinstall the original driver software. You can download that here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-vx-6000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-vx-6000</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't a Windows 10 version of the software available for the VX-6000, but you should be able to use Windows 7 version. So when you go to the download page set your operating system to Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>[/quote]Only MS themselves can give the real reason, all you'll get from the community is conjecture and speculation.&nbsp; The reason why I point this out is because MS has never stated why there is a cost associated with this, so we really don't know why, and
 then people who have asked the question before gets bent out of shape when they don't like what they hear from the community as to reasons why.&nbsp; I think it has to do with stuff on the back end and changes to the system and what not.&nbsp; Then again it could be
 just a money making thing for MS because people enjoy using different vanity names a lot.&nbsp;

<p>Speculation: &nbsp;I think it's more complicated than we give it credit for. &nbsp;A lot of companies won't ever let you change the username associated with your account. &nbsp;So the fact that we can at all is a very nice thing. &nbsp;I believe the charge isn't so much to
 cover the cost of these changes, but to deter abuse of the ability to change gamertag. &nbsp;If people could change their gamertag for free whenever they wanted, a lot of people would do it ALL the time. &nbsp;Maybe to avoid detection by players who don't like them.
 &nbsp;Maybe to parody the gamertags of people they don't like. &nbsp;Maybe to hijack someone's account and change their gamertag to free it up and steal it. &nbsp;I can't think of all the ways the system could be abused, but the ones I can think of seem concerning enough
 to warrant deterrent measures. &nbsp;I think a simple $10 fee is enough to sandbag a lot of low-level abuse. &nbsp;Leaves the tougher jobs as the only ones that need worrying about.</p>

<p>[quote user="BongKaos"]WOW. &nbsp;It doesn't work like that DC[/quote]It does work like that.<br />
<br />
If you change your gamertag the old name is added back into the pool of available ones.<br />
<br />
That old name is then free for you, or anyone else, to claim for another account.<br />
<br />
For example if you were to change your gamertag from <strong>BongKaos</strong> to
<strong>IlOveCaTs</strong>, then I would be perfectly free to grab your former name and change my gamertag to BongKaos.<br />
<br />
This really is something that a level 7 Ambassador should know.<br />
<br />
Here is the link on changing your gamertag <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-xbox-live-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>So you can pretty much change it if you are willing to cough up $10 to change your inactive account to a random name which in course will free up the old inactive gamertags name. Then spend another $10 to change your active account to the freed up gamertag
 name. If your willing to spend $20 all up to change both gamertag names it can be done OP. As I said it is probably not worth doing but that is my opinion, if you have $20 to blow go right ahead, just be quick and don't wait or it might get nabbed before you
 you can say bobs ya oncle. Thanks to all for verification. </p>

<h2>            Realtek RTL8139&#47;810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC &#35;2</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently purchased windows 7 ultimate and am ready to update from windows xp but just need a question answered.<br />
<br />
I have a Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC #2 adapter and when I run windows 7 upgrade advisor it shows that it's compatible, I'm just wondering do I need to install the drivers/software for this after Windows 7 installation or do I just install
 my internet like normal?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            You shouldn't have to do anything. The driver should be installed automatically.<br />

</p><p>Still no answer to the issue. If one is one a web page and right clicks on a link on that page, and selects "Open in New Tab", the link opens in a new tab, but the new tab is not what is displayed, you remain on the original web page. In IE as posted above,
 there was&nbsp;a setting to have the display switch to the new tab instead of remaining on the current page. I can find no setting (or regedit) information to have Edge (Windows 10) behave in this way.

<h2>            How can I get my Shimeji to work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just recently updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7 because on W7 the Shimejis didn't work. They still don't work. I've followed every tutorial and as much as I click the little computer with the face in it, the Shimejis wont appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The files are extracted</p>
<p>-Java 6, if not the latest Java</p>
<p>-Windows 8? or higher</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody else I know updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, and their Shimejis work just fine. I even tried taking the folder that they used from a flash drive and putting it on my computer, but it won't do anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The little icon in the corner won't pop up either, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>All of my consoles (except for a 360 slim) are skinned with Decal Girl skins. They're the most trusted skin company I've come across. Most console sites that sell skins, get them from Decal Girl. Their products are top notch. If you don't want to skin, you
 should check these out (my unskinned slim is in one)...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 imports TOO MANY photos from Samsung Galaxy S6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watha2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 imports TOO MANY photos from Samsung Galaxy S6</h2>
                    When I plug in my phone and run the "import photos" feature, Windows 10 doesn't just look at the DCIM folder on the S6, the one that stores photos taken with the camera. &nbsp;Instead, it scans all the phone's storage and finds every stored image, including
 icons and thumbnails, and tries to import all of them. &nbsp;This is silly. &nbsp;I just want the photos I've shot. &nbsp;Is there any way to tell Windows 10 to import only DCIM photos? &nbsp;Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that when a phone is connected to the PC and the “Import photos” option is selected, all the photos in the device will be imported to the PC and it is by design. To transfer selected photos need to open “This PC”, open the drive for
 the phone and select the photos that you want to transfer and then transfer the photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us for any other assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>But that's absurd. &nbsp;When I plug in an iPhone, this does not happen. &nbsp;It only pulls photos from the camera roll, and nothing else. &nbsp;Why won't it do that with my Android phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, Windows 10 also has a problem with the iPhone. &nbsp;It copies the pictures, then displays an error message and won't follow through on deleting them from the phone. &nbsp;Any idea why that's happening? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

                    I got my new Dell Q8300 (Intel Core 2 Quad processor) computer running Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit last week. At first, the speakers worked. Then, we got an error message saying to update my Sigmatel c-Major audio driver via the Integrated Device
 Technology's website. I did, and now the speakers don't work. I tried via Control Panel to roll back the driver update, but it didn't work. Can anyone advise me?

<span>When the error displayed on the screen and you updated the driver, was the new driver a 64bit version? This is important since 32bit drivers typically will not work on 64bit systems.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>You might go in and manually remove the old driver by uninstalling the software through Programs and Features or removing the driver completely through the Device Manager.
</span><span>After getting the driver uninstalled we suggest going to Dell’s website and seeing if there is a new 64bit version of your driver that is available.</span></p>

    <title>Applications and files are missing afte installing a torrent game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Applications and files are missing afte installing a torrent game</h2>
                    <p>Hello, a few days ago I noticed that some one the apps and games on my desktop have turned into a white blank file and when I tried to open them it told me that the shortcut for it has been moved or deleted, which I didn't do, but for other apps it also
 told me that it is searching for it and I can browse myself to find it, but I did not. I then went to my Local Disk D and saw that the majority of apps were missing. The only thing that I think could have affected my PC is the installation of a torrent downloaded
 for a game which I immediately deleted, but it did not delete any more files with it. I have to mention that most of the apps that disappeared are cracked games online, although I can't imagine how they have something to do with that certain file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there any way to find and recover my data?</p>
<p>

<p><span>The issue might be because of a malware infection on your device which caused the corruption of programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the files are hidden or not. Refer the article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check the files in recycle bin. Also, you can try searching the files with their extensions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open file explorer and press
<strong>ctrl + F</strong> key together.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now search for the file using the file extension adding the
<strong>*</strong> sign as a prefix, like <strong>*.exe</strong> or <strong>*.jpeg</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Increase the virtual memory and check if the files are recovered.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
