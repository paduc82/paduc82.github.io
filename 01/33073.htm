<h2>            Letters on some websites are not displayed correctly. C&#39;s become O&#39;s and I&#39;s become L&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have this problem that i'm facing currently.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86b0e144-2e30-4160-9325-b8900be1e836" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what happens to some of my websites. My texts cannot display C's and I's. Words that have C's will be changed to O (as you can see from the attached picture that content has become oontent) and my I's will change to L's (As you can see from links,align,etc..
 became llinks,allgn,etc..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I had this problem for quite sometime and it's quite frustrating to be reading an article that hasn't got the correct text's!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried on all my different browsers and all had the same problem (IE, Firefox &amp; Chrome)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello Annie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue specific to a few websites?</li><li>What is the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>current version of Internet Explorer</strong></a> installed in your system?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that some letters do not display correctly on a webpage. The issue may arise due to website incompatibility issues, hardware acceleration etc. So, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Fix site display problems with Compatibility View</span>
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>The issue may also arise if the Internet Explorer move all graphics and text rendering from the&nbsp;CPU to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). So, you may check the&nbsp;websites after enabling or disabling the hardware acceleration to check for hardware or software
 compatibility issues with viewing certain Internet websites.</p>
<p>Please try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;icon in the upper-right corner, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Internet Options.</strong></li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then under&nbsp;<strong>Accelerated graphics</strong>, select the
<strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</strong> check box. Clear the check box, if it is already selected.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, proceed to Method 3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p>Try to run Internet Explorer without add-ons and check if the webpage is displayed correctly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and then click
<strong>Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>System Tools</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Internet Explorer (No Add ons)</strong>.</li><li>Open the concerned website and check for the issue.</li></ol>
<p>If the website is displayed correctly, then try to manage add-ons as detailed in the following link.</p>
<p><span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is a bit weird and rarely noticed. So, to rule out the possibility of a virus infection, I would suggest you to try to
run a Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure computer is free from infections:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong><br />
Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<strong>Important: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. Much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the issue may also exist due to any third party software or startup service intervention, so I would suggest you to once check your system for the issue in Safe Mode with Networking. Refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Try to boot your system in a state of necessary Microsoft services in operation and a&nbsp;minimal set of drivers enabled, called
<em><span>Safe Mode</span></em></span>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer in safe mode </span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong><span>Safe mode with Networking </span>
</strong>in the Advanced startup options.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Recovery Your PC needs to be repaired Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thewirelord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Recovery Your PC needs to be repaired Error code&#58;0xc0000102</h2>
                    <p>So I have a computer with windows 8.1 installed on it. I have had this PC for a year now and have never had problems, but randomly today I tried to turn it on and it goes straight to a blue screen with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The operating system couldn't be started because the kernel is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File:\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000102</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wasn't trying to update or download any sort of software or anything when this happened. I simply turned it on from power off and this came up. I have the widows 8.1 recovery disk that came with the PC. It is an Avatar computer. I have tried to put
 the recovery disk in but it goes straight to the same blue screen as before and the only options I have are: "Press Enter to try again" and Press F8 for startup settings. I have tried the startup settings like "Enable debugging" and all of the 9 options that
 come up when I press F8 but it always brings me back to the blue screen with "Recovery Your PC needs to be repaired..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? Please Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Also,if safe-mode wont start,try booting to system tools on start-up (dell is F12)</p>
<p>try recovery console.At recovery,select 1 for C:&nbsp; press enter for password</p>
<p>Type: FixBoot&nbsp; agree,type:&nbsp; CHKDSK C: /R&nbsp; once thru,type: EXIT&nbsp; let the OS start.</p>

            <p>If it was short circuit you would not hear anything at all as any audio would sink through the short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't test the audio output with a multimeter in diode or beeper mode with power on as the output would drive the meter hence show a circuit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have reinstalled the HP driver it is more likely to be a hardware fault with the output chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try a bootable Linux image and see if that will drive the audio to prove the output. If it works then the hardware is OK but if no sound it could be the Linux interface driver so would not be conclusive.</p>

<p>thank you for your suggestion</p>
<p>I will try that right away.</p>
<p>But what if it is not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>any other theories about how it could happen?</p>
<p>Because I just pray it to be a software problem as my audio chipset is a part of motherboard</p>
<p>So i am not interested to replace the whole thing :)</p>

<h2>            Windows updates keep failing, getting error code&#58; 80010108 and 80200001</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 Single Language</p>
<p>64-bit OS x64-based processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>AVG Internet Security 2015</p>
<p>Google Chrome</p>
<p>3G USB internet connection (+2GB available data), available download "speed" WDCMA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer Aspire E1-570</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling for days to install updates, with a multitude of error codes being returned</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's error codes I'm receiving are 80010108 (generic error on the update screen)</p>
<p>error code 80200001 (Update History, per line item status)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the suggestions in the Community discussions relating to the update failures, including the registry "disable" and "enable" steps, as well as the "Clean Boot" - all options did not achieve results</p>
<p>I've tried installing the updates with the firewall &nbsp;and internet security disabled, without any success</p>
<p>I've tried manually selecting the updates one at a time, but even the smallest update of less than 100KB fails</p>
<p>At one point, the system was telling me "no network connection" even though the 3G modem was connected and internet activity was available</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago I did a windows re-install from my recovery disc as well in an attempt to resolve these issues (I was concerned that all the changes and adjustments I'd done may have created more problems) - no resolution after the re-install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing seems to work! &nbsp;I'm pretty desperate please</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rene,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for updating us on the issue. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you a few questions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have you tired disabling AVG and checked the issue?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have you tried running the fix-it, to reset Windows update components? If yes, what was the result?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check the settings for metered network. If you have limited amount of data offered by your Internet Service Provider, a data limit is set often to limit the usage. If you have a metered
 Internet connection, setting your network connection to ‘metered’ in Windows can help you reduce the amount of data you send and receive. To learn more about metered internet connection and to change the settings, you refer to the following Microsoft article.
 Turn off the metered connection and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to that, you may also try running the “fix-it” to reset Windows update components. To do so, you may refer to the link provided by Jayant Gupta on March 24, 2015. Also try disabling AVG,
 before you try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore,

            <p>Hi Sahil</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I did disable AVG and the issues did not resolve</p>
<p>2. I did run the Fix-it &nbsp;and the issues did not resolve</p>
<p>2a. I also manually reset the Windows Update Components (via Command prompt) and the issues did not resolve</p>
<p>3. I did a clean boot and the issues did not resolve</p>
<p>4. I tried manual download and install of a single update and even the smallest update of 38KB failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what we've tried we have not been able to resolve the issues. &nbsp;An ITC has today (2 April 2015) done a full re-install of Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will later today be trying to run Windows Updates and hope to no longer have any issues. &nbsp;I will update this string once we've tried to run the updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Rene</p>

            <p>Hi Sahil</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full re-install went well. I managed to install everything with no problems.&nbsp; When going to windows updates, I initially had the update settings on Manual, and there were 45 important updates and a number of optional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the settings to automatic and also activated the "send me other Microsoft updates".&nbsp; Once I'd done this, the Windows Updates display list was blank, but the system told me there were ±75 updates to install.&nbsp; The list remained blank, so I could
 not see what updates were needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the settings back to Manual and unchecked the "other Microsoft updates", restarted the machine and my updates list was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed all the important updates, restarted the machine with no problems.&nbsp; All was good.&nbsp; I then downloaded the optional updates and restarted the machine.&nbsp; When it completed the startup process, many of the services were no longer running,
 with many saying "not activated/connected/installed". Included in this was the network connection, audio output device and many others.&nbsp; Then Windows Explorer stopped responding, along with Task Manager.&nbsp; I eventually did a hard shutdown and from there, the
 machine would not boot up - it would get to a point in the startup process and just hang (+2hours)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I have again done a restore (keeping existing files) and will again be installing the Windows Updates.&nbsp; If the processes fail again, I am going to ditch Windows 8.1), and purchase Windows 7!&nbsp; I'm tired of struggling with this</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>After doing the 3rd re-install (keeping all my files), the only way I can download and install Updates is to have the settings on Manual and &nbsp;unchecking both&nbsp;"Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates"&nbsp;and "Give me updates for
 other Microsoft products...."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I elected to download and install only the Important Updates (45 in total).&nbsp; All installed without a problem except for Update KB3000850.&nbsp; This failed twice before installing correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing all the important Windows updates, I tried checking the "Give me recommended updates ..." and "Give me other Microsoft updates".&nbsp; No updates would download - error message 8024402F</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select the "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates", and run "Check for Updates", it works.&nbsp; But as soon as I select "Give me other Microsoft updates" and run "Check for Updates" they all fail</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet elected to download any of the recommended Updates(31 in total)&nbsp;because it was at this point that the laptop crashed on the 4th April 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the Updates settings to Automatically receive and install updates, but have the "Give me other Microsoft Updates" unchecked.&nbsp; I shall monitor the machine's behaviour for a few days</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way I can receive regular updates for my MS Office 2013 (Business and Home)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm truly not impressed with Windows 8 / Windows 8.1 :(</p>

<p>i would check your network settings on your xbox and make sure that it is set to obtain all network info automatically.
</p>
<p>if your xbox is using an ethernet cord(not wireless) try replacing it, or try plugging directly into your modem because it may be your router. if your computer is plugged into the same router and it has internet connection try a different port on the router
 because the port on the router may have gone bad. </p>
<p>if your xbox is using a wireless connection then you may need to check your wireless settings on the router and the wireless settings on your xbox to make sure they are compatible.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 reboot takes too long</h2>
                    I've had my HP Windows 7 desktop for at least 5 years now, with last year being that I upgraded it to Windows 10. I've noticed recently a virus that was affecting my web searches, but as hard as I tried, I couldn't get rid of it. Because of that, I decided
 to restart my computer to its factory settings. However, it's been 2 days already, &nbsp;and the computer is still not done restarting. I feel worried that something is wrong. Any advice?&nbsp;

            Thank you Ramesh Kumar. I hard restarted my computer, and it seems to be working again. However, my computer seems to be stuck in a cycle of restarting. It would load up, say that it's installing something and that it's 96% done, and then it would restart
 again. Do you know what's going on?

<span>Hi motc7,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Boot the computer in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for
<span>Windows</span> that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run
<span>Windows</span> are started. The words <strong>
<span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which
<span>Windows</span> mode you're using.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, click the arrow next to the
<strong><span>Shut Down</span></strong> button, and then click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Do one of the following:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the
<span>Windows</span> logo appears. If the <span>
Windows</span> logo appears, you'll need to try again by waiting until the <span>
Windows</span> logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>On the
<strong><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press Enter.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p>
<span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> in the corners of your monitor. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let
<span>Windows</span> start normally.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>Method 1: If the issue persists, perform Clean boot in Safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean
 boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in clean boot i.e disable non microsoft services.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The purpose of disabling non microsoft services is to check if any of these services is
</span></p>
<p>
<span>causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the steps below to boot the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note : Reset the computer to start as usual</span></p>
<p>
<span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 2: Also try to update drivers for the devices by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Method 3: Check if there are any errors in the Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include separate logs about the programs that run on your computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain
 to specific <span>Windows</span> services.</span></span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span><span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking

</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 clicking </span></span><span><span><strong>Administrative Tools</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 and then double-clicking </span></span><span><span><strong>Event Viewer</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span><span><span>&nbsp;If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click an event log in the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click an event to view the details of the event.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Random BSOD after bios update</h2>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After bios update I have started to experience random BSOD. Bios was updated because system was detecting only 8 gb of ram, and i have 2 x 8 gb of ram. Things i have tried till now:</p>
<p>1) Memtest86 it went for 15 hours, it didn't show any error</p>
<p>2) I tried sfc /scannow, also it was successful</p>
<p>3) I updated windows and all drivers, also it was successful but BSOD still continues</p>
<p>4) I checked my SSD and hard disk for any errors, that was successful also</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experience BSOD in random moments. And i started experience them only after bios update, before that everything was working normally.</p>
<p>Can you help me detect problem?</p>

            If it has happened after BIOS update, you can consider installing older BIOS.
<br />What is the make and model of the PC?

            I sent PC to computer service due to RAM issue i mentioned before. They updated BIOS. I can send them PC again, but it seems illogical to me that updating BIOS can cause random BSOD.

            You can downgrade the BIOS your self.
<br />If that doesn't work, send the PC to repair again.

<p>Hi Zaffron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible reasons why the issue happens are: an outdated driver and missing or corrupted system files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/a183aa8b-0eac-4566-867a-98d2761a770d/fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter</a></strong> for sound problem to resolve

<p>I have updated my driver to the latest one by going to my manufacturers support website.</p>
<p>And talking about troubleshooter i used 'Audio Troubleshooter' , 'Bluetooth Troubleshooter' , 'Recording Audio trouble shooter' but every troubleshooter ends with same thing like this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/991f9e4d-94e3-4f48-b28d-64778a56865b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/991f9e4d-94e3-4f48-b28d-64778a56865b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other screenshots that might be helpful. I used the snipping tool for the screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf75f778-40f0-4069-bd33-d74b01004787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf75f778-40f0-4069-bd33-d74b01004787" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/199f40c0-65b8-4aba-ac07-4b698dfca80c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/199f40c0-65b8-4aba-ac07-4b698dfca80c" /></a></p>
<p>And i am still not able to record my audio through my headset ( it works only for skype and communication purposes )</p>

<h2>            Sleep mode issue Dell laptop.</h2>
                    I have a Dell 15-3552 running Insider build 17634. When I put it into sleep mode the AC power disconnects from battery and won't reconnect on waking computer till I unplug the AC from the charger and reconnect it. Unplugging the charger output from the
 computer doesn't restore charging mode only disconnecting AC power input. I had enabled hybrid sleep and set the laptop to wake from my wireless mouse but disabling that didn't fix the issue.

<p>Turning off Fast Startup did not fix the problem and my laptop doesn't have Intel Management Engine Interface in Device Manager so I can't do that repair. If I use Hibernate the problem doesn't occur so I'll have to do that until some other answer can be
 found for my situation. Thanks for the response but this unfortunately doesn't work for my Dell.</p>

<p>My reply should have shown up with the repost but apparently didn't. Turning off Fast Startup didn't fix the issue and I don't have the Intel Management Engine Interface available on this machine so couldn't try that solution. It seems that particular item
 isn't used with the Intel chipset my laptop uses. I can use Hibernation mode and it works okay so I guess I'll have to do that till I or someone can find a solution. I do appreciate your response.</p>

<p>Perhaps the next Skip Ahead update will contain a fix, if not I'll continue using Hibernate for now.</p>

<h2>            does continue on pc work on iphone to windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the new fall creators update and I added my phone which is an iPhone. I entered my phone number and installed the app on my phone. However, when I try to use it, goes to 'finding my devices' and then comes back with a message saying that I need to
 link my hone, etc. When I then go to my settings on my computer and click on the phone icon, under manage phones, it just had the option to add the phone...no phone already listed. If I click on the "manage my devices linked with Microsoft acct", it doesn't
 show my phone or give me an option to add an iPhone.</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>I am on Windows 10 with the latest fall creators update. IPhone is on the latest ios upgrade and is an iPhone 7.</p>

<h2>            Restarting problem in win7 for Acer Aspire 4710 Laptop__</h2>
                    I am running win7 on Acer Aspire 4710 Laptop. All drivers and bios of my laptop is up-to-date but I have a problem with win7: when I hibernate or sleep my laptop and then resume it and then I try to restart the laptop,win7 turn my laptop off and then turn
 it on but the Bios does not load hardware and the display does not show anything (does not show Acer Bios Logo) and laptop does not boot OS. After 3 second my laptop restart again and in this time bios loads hardware(show Acer Bios Logo) and boot the OS. this
 problem occurs only when I sleep or hibernate my laptop and resume it from hibernate or sleep and then restart it. If I turn on my laptop and do not hibernate or sleep it, it will restart correctly and without any problem. in win XP I did not have such this
 problem. what can I do for solving this problem?

            I would recommend downloading the latest available drivers for your laptop&nbsp;from Acer. It appears that there are no specific Windows 7 drivers available for this model, so you should be able to use the latest drivers available for Windows Vista instead.<br />
<br />
To download drivers for your laptop, go to <a href="http://gd.panam.acer.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://gd.panam.acer.com/home/</a>, then confirm your computer model (Laptop &gt; Aspire &gt; 4710), and then select "Windows Vista" (the edition shouldn't matter) - simply ensure that you select the correct architecture (if you are running 32-bit Windows, select
 x32, otherwise if you are running 64-bit Windows, select x64).<br />
<br />
<strong>To find out what architecture of Windows your computer is running:<br />
</strong>1. Click on Start, right click on Computer, then click on Properties.<br />
2. In the System Properties window next to "system type," you will see "32-bit Operating System" or "64-bit Operating System".<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, have a great day!

    <title>remove secondary plex option at boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott d. 559  say:</h3>
<h2>            remove secondary plex option at boot</h2>
                    My computer used to be configured for RAID 1. Since this was constant resynching, I removed the RAID feature and used the second drive as a backup drive instead (a backup is actually more suited to my needs). The problem is, when I start up my machine,
 the bootloader still gives me the option for "Windows 7 - Secondary Plex", even though there isn't one.&nbsp; How can I remove this without harming my primary disk?

            <p>In msconfig, under the boot tab does it show the two boot options? and if so you delete the unwanted?</p>
<p>BTW were you using win7 default raid, and if so your disks were converted to dynamic, if that is the case you might want to do something about that.</p>

                    <p>Original title: <strong>The beep that won't die!</strong> </p>
<p>Hi everyone, I have a beep that is driving me crazy. A couple of days ago my keyboard started to beep every time a key was hit. I have done a bit of research and disabled the beep driver but this had no effect. Being clever I thought if I uninstalled the
 beep driver there could be no more beeps. The driver is gone but still the beep lives on! can anyone please please help?!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The Keyboard is beeping for a reason we should try and figure out why it’s beeping. From the sound of it they might have
 a stuck key possibly. Please check every key to make sure they aren’t stuck.&nbsp; It could also be signs of memory issues or even possibly a CMOS battery going bad. You can also go into the BIOS&nbsp;and double check the date and time. *<b>Enter at your own risk while
 in the BIOS</b>*&nbsp;that is if you aren’t familiar with what you are doing in there.</span></p>

            Have you checked if filter keys or sticky keys is on? If not, go to the ease of access section in the control panel, then choose "change how your keyboard works" it should be in there. I hope this helps, and if you fixed it, I hope this helps people in
 the future :)

<p>My computer started doing the same thing a couple days ago after I shut it down wrong. I highly recommend using this tool. I ran it and it stopped the beeping right away. It's free, but they do like a small donation, well worth it to get rid of the annoying&nbsp;beeping
 sounds. It's the Adware Removal Tool by TSA</p>
<p>Free download. I've used it a few times now and it always works.</p>

            I thought my keyboard was beeping too, and it drove me nuts!&nbsp; &nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; It turns out it was my mouse beeping because it was dirty inside or worn out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Blow hard on the bottom side of your mouse (into the light) and see if that causes the beeping.&nbsp; &nbsp;You
 may have to clean or replace the mouse, not the keyboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;Worth a try!&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

<h2>            Event log on MS Office files under Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would very much appreciate if someone could throw me some light on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in desparate need to find/track the activity(open/edit/save/close etc) on a certain MS Office file.(Powerpoint and Word)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file in question is in a notebook running on Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at my notebook that runs on Windows 8 I can see all the details under OSession, a log file under Microsoft Office Session which is under App programs and Service log on event viewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This OSession shows all the detail operations of MS Office and I wonder if there is a similar, if not same, log file in Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing any sort of hints desparately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank u for taking the time!</div>
<div>The end goal is to find as detailed activity log on MS Office, especially Power Point.</div>
<div>What time the user opened the file, how long the user worked and what time the file was saved or closed.</div>
<div>I could see something like this in Windows 8 under OSession(or Microsoft Office Session) log.</div>
<div>Finding such data in XP would reaally help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank u in advance.</div>

            Why are you not asking your question in the MS Office forums (this is the XP forum).<br />
<br />
The Office forums are here:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office"><br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office</a><br />
<br />
You might want to include your XP and Office version and Service Packs.<br />
<br />
Event logging in the Event Viewer in the Micorosft Office Sessions log was introduced in Office 2007 even though the Events say "Office 12 Sessions" and I read that is because it was the 12th release.&nbsp; It is not something you enable/disable in XP - it depends
 on the version of Office you are using. &nbsp; If you are using an Office version prior to 2007, there is no logging in the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Those events look something like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Office 12 Sessions<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7000<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12/19/2013<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:04:24 AM<br />
Description:<br />
ID: 1, Application Name: Microsoft Office Excel, Application Version: 12.0.6683.5002, Microsoft Office Version: 12.0.6612.1000. This session lasted 474 seconds with 360 seconds of active time.&nbsp; This session ended normally.<br />
<br />
You can get more auditing details if you are using an Exchange Server but if you are not in a corporate environment that may not be an option for you.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend enabling additional auditing in XP unless you know what you are doing since that is not what XP audit logging is for, the logs fill up quickly and will be overwritten unless you make allowances for that, your system performance will suffer
 and it has nothing to do with logging Office events.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello and thank you for the comprehensive guideline. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like you suggested I may need to also, post a question in the Office forum.</p>
<p>However, I want to cover the XP relevance before I go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your explanation it seems not likely I could get the details on the Office Sessions since, the version of the Office program is 97-2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to identify and document the PC usage time(from power on to shut off time on the day of use)during&nbsp;a given 1week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a far-from IT guy I just managed to locate the System event log file but that is just as far as I can go. Event IDs(6006 6009 6005 7036 7035 6 1&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;are just not my language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would very much appreciate if you or anyone out there can interpret this event log to just a simple day to day language such as power on: DDMMYY H:M, power off on DDMMYY H:M.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I tried using a PC management software but its usage time does not really seem to match the log file.(log file contained much more activities EVEN after the software's end time)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not recognize my iphone 5s</h2>
                    <p>My new iphone 5s is not recognized in Device Manager of Win7.&nbsp; It is not listed in ANY category, Portable Device, USB, etc.</p>
<p>Win7 has all available software updates.</p>
<p>Apple Mobile Device Support v7.1.1.3 is installed.</p>
<p>Latest version of iTunes is installed.</p>
<p>No iphone shown in iTunes, either, of course.</p>
<p>The iphone 5s itself seems to work perfectly (although I wish the ringer volume was louder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into everything that I can think of, but still have no solution.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any practical suggestions?</p>

            <p>Well, the simplest solution is usually the best.&nbsp; I borrowed a cable from an iphone dealer, plugged it in, problem solved!!&nbsp; Early on I had dismissed the possibility that the cable was defective because it was new.&nbsp; I shouldn't have done that...&nbsp; I was turning

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Problems - General and Specific - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregwalton42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Problems - General and Specific</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 Pro 64-bit desktop has an SSD boot drive which holds system apps and app data plus 4 HDs for storage. It is the hub of my music studio. I also have a Windows 10 Home laptop with an SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Anniversary Update which pushed itself on to my desktop yesterday (24th Sept 2016) caused it to hang before reaching the lock screen. Rebooting using the hardware reset button led it to restart and automatically revert to a 1511 build. Not too bad, ~I
 have to admit - but a waste of my time and, in effect, a denial of service attack on my studio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not wanting to be going through this situation every day I have temporarily suspended Windows Updates. So I'm now in a position where:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm getting no security updates</li><li>I don't know when it will be safe to turn updates back on</li><li>I daren't even power up my Windows 10 laptop</li></ol>
<p>Looking around it seems that Microsoft are saying this is a rare occurrence affecting a few people with apps on an SSD and app data on a separate drive. However MS seem to make it difficult to report such problems so may have no idea how rare or common they
 are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do I know when it will be safe to reinstate updates, including the Anniversary Update?</li><li>How should one report these problems?</li><li>When will MS admit that the problem is not just with systems having apps on an SSD and app data elsewhere?</li><li>How are Window 10 Home users supposed to manage with broken builds of Windows being thrust at them?</li><li>When will MS give users more control over updates, as users keep asking?</li></ol>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we go through all that I have found something which might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring the Windows Update service and checking for updates it tells me there is a problem which needs to be solved first. It turns out that it is unable to update the System Reserved partition. Using Disk Management it turns out that this partition is
 350MB with only 14MB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The size of the partition was set by the Windows installation and the data in it has been placed there by the Windows OS. It occurs to me that if SSD users are having problems with the Anniversary Update it may be that it is because this partition is too
 small - which, in turn, may be because SSDs tend (at least until recently) to be small compared to HDDs. That would depend whether the size of the System Reserved is affected by the size of the disk to which it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way it suggests that the problem might be solved by increasing the size of this partition. I have tools which could do this (Paragon Hard Disk Manager, amongst others) but I wouldn't want to go ahead with changing it without the go-ahead from someone
 who understands these things better than I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you say it should be safe for me to try this? If it is significant it has MBR partitioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg</p>

            <p>In case any other users are following this here is some other information I have found elsewhere in the Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The System Reserved Partition (SRP) size is set by the Windows installation</li><li>It is not dependent on the disk size but, rather, the Windows version</li><li>For Windows 7 it was 100MB; for Windows 8 and later it is 350MB</li><li>There are a number of cases reporting the SRP getting full. It is said that some anti-virus software writes to this partition, though I haven't yet seen proof of this</li><li>It is possible and safe to extend the size of the SRP, if you use suitable partition tools</li></ul>
<p>OK, continuing my own saga...</p>
<p>I have moved my OS partition up a bit and resized the SRP to 498MB. I then went through Windows Update and tried once more to install the Anniversary Update. This time there was no message about being unable to write to the SRP but the installation failed
 at the same point - the blue windows logo with the rolling circle circle of "I'm thinking about it" dots. After being stuck on this for two hours I reset the computer a couple of times until it reverted to the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically no progress except that a full SRP isn't the only problem stopping the update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here's the diskmgmt screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ee78693-0b28-4bed-9609-2d3d1898f87d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ee78693-0b28-4bed-9609-2d3d1898f87d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the system info report:</p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/t/s!AmWqgH1sTEsvoh7pMNMQ4RP-Z_iD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Info BB</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and the link to the system events report:</p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmWqgH1sTEsvoiBbXqYXN_9NWu_t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Events BB</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A little more background:</p>
<p>The system is pretty old. I built it myself some years ago and it has an old BIOS with no support for UEFI and only SATA 2, USB 2, etc. It has a Core 2 Duo overclocked to 2.7GHz; 4GB of RAM, a 120GB Samsung EVO 840 SSD boot drive and about 4TB storage over
 4 HDDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of updating it (new mobo, CPU and RAM) some time this year. I'm beginning to think I may do that sooner rather than later. It runs perfectly well I just don't need these sort of problems going forward if MS are having trouble supporting older
 systems.</p>

            <p>BTW, looking through Device Manager I notice there is an Unknown Device without a driver. The only thing it can tell me about it is under Events where it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Device ACPI\ABT2005\3&amp;2411e6fe&amp;0 requires further installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell it is a means by which a utility running under Windows can communicate with the Abit motherboard's uGuru overclocking system. I don't need this so I have disabled it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>OK, I also discovered the Windows Update Troubleshooter (Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; View All &gt; Windows Update). I ran this and then ran it again in Admin mode. It stopped and started "Cryptsvc" and then reported that "Windows Update components needed
 to be fixed" and that it had fixed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to Action Centre &gt; All Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update (because, for some reason, not all settings are available in Control Panel now) and checked for updates... and the Anniversary Update is no longer available!</p>

            <p>Sorry, forgot to say that I'm using the free Malwarebytes which I run manually on occasion so I assume this does not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is connected by Ethernet and, being a desktop, is constantly mains powered. The broadband connection here is only about 6 Mbps but it downloads the update OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the various fixes I have tried updating using the Windows Upgrade Assistant but had the same problem as before - it hung for four hours just "spinning its wheels" having got to somewhere around 60% complete and just after it had rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems a little ironic to have to prepare for an update (especially disabling antivirus and firewall) when MS have done all they can to hide updates from the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old professional PCI soundcard installed which doesn't have Windows 10 drivers (though it works fine). I'm planning on removing this and some other old non-essentials before I try the In Place Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let this thread know how it turns out</p>
