<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer in Win10</h2>
                    In windows 10&nbsp; - can I change the background colour of Windows Photo Viewer from white to black?&nbsp; I have tried the old regedit route and nothing happened. &nbsp; I am not talking about the new photo app which came with Win10.&nbsp; On windows 7 I had worked up a
 personalised theme with a black background, which I still have, but this no longer seems to work with photo viewer either.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To further assist you, please provide the following information:<br />
1. Since Windows Photo Viewer is not readily available in Windows 10, can you confirm if you manually installed it?<br />
2. Is there a specific Windows Photo Viewer feature that you are looking for in the Photos app? Also, the default background color of the Photos app is black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17194/windows-10-see-all-your-photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to see the features of the Photos app.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Loreto - I don't think I did install it manually, it was just there when I looked for different options for opening my pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the new Photo app has a black background, but it also has a narrow black toolbar across the top of the screen which cuts off the very top of the image.&nbsp; This is a real nuisance when viewing and assessing some types of images, for instance deciding
 which ones to keep and which to discard from a large batch of similar photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also give presentations to local art groups from time to time.&nbsp; I could run the images as a slideshow, that gets rid of the tool bar,&nbsp; if I could find out any way to control the slideshow manually which there doesn't seem to be.&nbsp; I can run a slideshow
 from my picture tools which puts everything on a black background and I can control that manually but I can't find a way to zoom into an image like I can with Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was on Win7 I put together a personalised theme with a black background and subdued titling etc. which worked brilliantly with Photo Viewer, changed the background to black and reduced all the text to unobtrusive dark tones so as not to distract from
 the art works.&nbsp; But when I switch over to this theme it no longer changes the background of Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the new Photo app in many ways, particularly the onscreen editing facilities, it's just that dark band ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all comes back to - can I get a black background onto Photo Viewer again!&nbsp; It would save me hours and hours of trying all sorts of control options and settings and time on forums and so on.</p>

            <p>Hi Loreto - I assume from your reply that your answer is "No, there is no way to alter the background in the way you wish to and were able to do in the past".&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post my feed back as you have suggested, although I have to say I am not happy about doing it that way as I will have to set my diagnostic and usage data to full disclosure.&nbsp; This apparently means that Microsoft, and anybody else they choose to share
 the data with, can in theory track every single move I make on my computer, which in these days of hacking, data leaks and misuse and abuse of personal data is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, having thought it through, I have decided I would rather live with the inconvenience than let you into my system any more than you already are.&nbsp; It is a great pity that one cannot register a simple query or feed back about a particular app without
 compromising one's privacy in the way that is required.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should look into leaving Microsoft and be looking for a less intrusive OS.</p>

            <p>Figured it out. I had to </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Under the "font" tab. Scrolled to the bottom and clicked "Show more fonts". This takes you to the "Fonts" page under "Appearances and personalization". Which is in the control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. On the left hand side, click on "Find a character".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;3. When the&nbsp;"Character&nbsp;Map"&nbsp;appears. Scroll through the various fonts and find the one you are using. Which in my case was "Segeo Print".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;4. Find the character you want. Which in my case was the</p>

<p>

            <p>Just to clarify, many characters can be found that way, not just subscripts (<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉)&nbsp;</span>and superscripts (<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹)</span>,
 but things like fractions (½) and other math symbols (°±√).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to find these things is to try a search on the web for "Unicode symbol" and then the name of what you want. Copy and paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure you have chosen a Unicode font in Movie Maker.</p>

<p>I'M REALLY SICK OF HEARING ABOUT THE CLOUD STORAGE BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM THIS HAPPEND BEFORE THE CLOUD STORAGE CAME OUT. ITS NOT ABOUT WEATHER OR NOT &nbsp;I MADE A BACKUP.THE PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER I LOADED THE GAME AND THE SAVED GAME DATA BECAME CORRUPTED
 (GEARS OF WAR 3 SAVED GAME DATA GOT RESET )THERE IS NOW ITEMS IN THE GAME THAT DON'T UNLOCK.I COULD MAKE A 100 BACKUPS OF THE GAME DELETE MY PROFILES RE DOWNLOAD CLEAR THE SYSTEM CASHE WHATEVER AND STILL DOSENT FIX THE FACT THAT THE SAVED GAME DATA HAS BEEN
 CORRUPTED THE DATA IS STORED ON THE SERVER AND SINCE THE GAME GOT CORRUPTED ON THE SERVER AND SINCE I ALREADY HAD THE ITEMS UNLOCKED THE GAME WONT UNLOCK THE ITEMS BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY DO THE CHALLENGE ONCE.ONCE YOU HAVE THE ACHIEVEMENTS UNLOCK YOU CANNOT
 DELETE THAT ACHIEVEMENT AGAIN AND REDO THAT CHALLENGE AND GET THE ACHIEVEMENT AGAIN BECAUSE THE GAME WON'T LET YOU. WHEN THE GAME GOT RESET THE DATA ALL GOT ERASED EXCEPT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENTS.THE GAME WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO UNLOCK THE ACHIEVEMENTS AGAIN NO
 MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THAT I REPEAT THE CHALLENGE.MICROSOFT WILL NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM THEY WANT ME TO DELETE MY WHOLE ENTIRE PROFILE ACHIEVEMENTS AND EVERYTHING,CREATE A NEW GAMER TAG AND START OVER FROM 0 AGAIN AND PAY FOR ANOTHER XBL ACCOUNT.THERE IS NO
 WAY I'M GOING TO DO THAT I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES WITH IN GAME ITEMS NOT UNLOCKING IVE BEEN TO THE FORUMS IVE READ ALL THE COMPLAINTS I WANT TO HEAR GEARS OF WAR ISSUES.LOOK AT THIS GUY IANBANN82 HE HAS 80320
 GAMER SCORE WHAT IF HE HAD TO RESET THAT TO 0 BECAUSE ITEMS NOT UNLOCKING IN GEARS 3 HE WOULD PROBABLY BE PISSED TO I NEED A SOLUTION NOT A SCAM FOR MICROSOFT TO MAKE MORE MONEY.</p>

<p>your right i would be more than a little pissed off found this on the epic forums there is more info on there if needed but hope this helps if only to be able to get your unlocks again its from the same guy who did the video above</p>
<p>HOW TO ACCESS LOCKED UNLOCKS AFTER BEING RESET:</p>
<p>After being reset, some unlocks (such as the For The Horde medal) become unavailable, and can no longer be unlocked. GD01 figured out a great way around this problem, so that all locked unlocks will become available again. This method has been tried by several
 people and seems to be effective at fixing the problem. You can read more about it on this thread if you are unsure. There are two guides available for you to follow. One is written by GD01 and is performed while online. The other is a fleshed out and slightly
 more descriptive guide written by FredFlintstoned and is performed while offline. I will just post both and you may take your pick. Unfortunately, I will probably be unable to answer questions about these guides as I haven't tried them myself. Feel free to
 ask questions in the thread I linked to above. NOTE: This method will allow everyone who has been reset to acquire the crimson weapon skins, all 3 of the avatar awards, all of the medals including "for the horde" now and everything else as well. BUT, you will
 have to re-acquire all of the collectibles in the campaign/arcade mode and you'll also need to complete campaign/arcade on hardcore in order to play it on insane.</p>
<p>GDO1- Online guide:</p>
<p>This one was done still connected online. You can use the other detailed one for offline option. No need to clear the cache only if needed or necessary.</p>
<p>Play 1 private match so that you can update your files as well as the servers. Then head to the Menus and straight to the dashboard.</p>
<p>1) transfer your player data and campaign save to the usb, then log off and transfer your gamertag to the usb.</p>
<p>2) log in on the dashboard and start the game.</p>
<p>3) when you see the shield like symbol with EPIC logo on it remove the usb and ignore the message that pops up. let it run through till the part where it tells you to Press Start w/ the Gears 3 logo</p>
<p>4) Once you hit start go to your stats/awards and scroll through the tabs and go to the collectables and then to the achievements. Both should be empty.</p>
<p>5) From there (at the achievement tab) place the usb back and a message saying that there's a new storage device or device has changed. Press A to continue which should take you back to the title screen where it tells you to Press Start with the Gears 3
 logo. Don't press start.</p>
<p>6) Head back to the dashboard and log off. Transfer just your gamertag back to your HDD [the game already placed your player data from the backup in the servers or cache but if you like you can transfer the one from the usb or keep it as a back up]</p>
<p>7) remove your usb and log back in and start the game. Check back to your stats/awards and you should see your collectables empty and you campaign progress is gone like you haven't even touched it.</p>
<p>You will still have your achievements under your stata/award [ war journal ]. The progress did reset themselves so you will see the boxes pop up even tho you already got the achievement.</p>
<p>All your mutators, medals, skins, executions, and medals you unlock should be intact. And their progress as well.</p>
<p>FredFlintstoned detailed offline guide:</p>
<p>I tried GD01's instructions and it worked for me too!</p>
<p>However, the instructions were somewhat ambiguous.</p>
<p>But this is what I did based on what GD01 wrote:</p>
<p>NOTE: before you do this, make an extra backup copy of your gamertag, Gears of War 3 campaign data and Gears of War 3 player save data to a SECOND memory card or USB portable hard drive just in case. (you can now use the cloud for this). If the guide does
 not work for you, try clearing your cache. That seems to fix it.</p>
<p>1. Go offline by removing your internet connection from your XBox.</p>
<p>2. Sign in on the dashboard (offline)</p>
<p>3. "Move" (not copy) your Gears of War 3 player data and Campaign data to a memory card or usb portable hard drive.</p>
<p>4. "Move" (not copy) your gamertag to the same memory card or usb portable hard drive. It'll say you need to sign-out first before you can move your gamertag. Go ahead and confirm this when it prompts you.</p>
<p>5. Sign in on the dashboard (offline) with your gamertag from the same memory card or usb portable hard drive that you transferred your data to and start the Gears of War 3 game.</p>
<p>6. When you see the first Epic logo appear when starting up your Gears of War 3 game, physically remove the memory card or usb portable hard drive from your Xbox and ignore the message that appears about placing the unit back in.</p>
<p>7. Press start on your controller and go to your stats/awards. If you check your Achievements and Campaign Collectables, they should be empty.</p>
<p>8. Plug-in your memory card or usb portable hard drive back into your Xbox. When you do this, wait a few seconds and it should automatically take you back to the Gears 3 logo where it tells you to press start (but don't actually press start on your controller).
 Instead exit back to the dashboard.</p>
<p>9. "Move" (not copy) your updated/modified Gears of War 3 player data and your gamertag from your memory card or usb portable hard drive back to your Xbox 360 hard drive but DO NOT MOVE OR COPY your Campaign data back to your hard drive.</p>
<p>10. Remove your memory card or usb portable hard drive from your XBox 360.</p>
<p>11. Sign back in with your gamertag and start up Gears of War 3 (offline) and check to see if your campaign collectibles are gone. If you did the steps correctly, they should be gone.</p>
<p>12. Now you can connect or go back online with your Xbox 360, sign in with your gamertag and start up your Gears of War 3 game.</p>
<p>You should now be able to acquire all of the medals, achievements, avatars and weapon skins you weren't able to acquire when you were reset.</p>
<p>Even though you will still have your achievements that you've earned listed in the game, the game will think you don't have any achievements.</p>
<p>So you'll frequently see an achievement progression bar pop-up for all achievements while playing. This will go away after you actually got the achievement again.</p>
<p>This method will allow everyone who has been reset to acquire the crimson weapon skins, all 3 of the avatar awards, all of the medals including "for the horde" now and everything else as well.</p>
<p>You will have to re-acquire all of the collectibles in the campaign/arcade mode and you'll also need to complete campaign/arcade on hardcore in order to play it on insane.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading guys, any extra information you can contribute would be welcome &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Do I have a Lemon&#63; Unknown Device in Other Devices&#63;</h2>
                    I decided to pick up a Surface Pro 2 to upgrade from my Surface Pro 1. I can say that I've had a lot of problems with this thing... So I'm wondering if I have a lemon on my hands. The Marvell Wifi Adapter gets lost or disabled often, and even after my
 4th complete system reset, upon initial configuration, I have an "Unknown Device" in the Device Manager, under the "Other Devices". Other times, the Wifi adapter just appears with a exclamation... Even after the firmware update, it just doesn't seem to work
 right.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone else run into this? Should I just return the thing, because my Surface Pro 1 seems far more stable, and I've had my SP1 since it launched...&nbsp;</div>

            Well, as sad as it is... I've decided that the Surface Pro 2 is far too buggy along with Windows 8.1 to warrant keeping. I've reset the device back to factory several times already, and each time something else goes awry. From the get-go I have this Unknown
 device, which I'm guessing is the Surface Cover Telemetry driver issue, and my attempts to fix it just aren't working. It shouldn't have come this way, and compared to my Surface Pro 1, it just isn't that much better. I wanted the extra battery life, memory
 and HD space, but it just isn't working well enough for me to keep... Maybe I do have a lemon, but I think I'll just wait till next years Surface Pro 3...

There have been a few reports of problems with the firmware update <em>(dated October 24th)</em> and the symptoms you describe are very similar to those reported so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would highly recommend restoring the device and installing all updates, apart from the firmware update. That's how I'm running my SP2 at the moment and I can't fault it. I only start seeing problems when the firmware update is installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've opened a thread about this myself and I'm hoping that we can get some answers from Microsoft soon. But, I'll reiterate, I've had no problems at all when the firmware update isn't installed.</p>

            <p>Yes I do the updates as they come on a daily basis, the problem still persist on Device Manager, as stated earlier on my message, the problem will go away if I turn Bluetooth radio of, mind that I only use Bluetooth for Microsoft Wedge mouse.
</p>
<p>Overall I am happy with the surface pro 2 512Gb, except those issues that should be addressed by Microsoft, if they want the product to be a real PRO.</p>

                    I have a Gateway notebook with Vista 64 bit OS.&nbsp; I would like to change the mouse to use single click on the desktop instead of having to double click.&nbsp; I cannot find any way to do this.&nbsp; It was a straightforward choice in XP.&nbsp; How is it done with Vista??

            Hi Viking44,<br />
<br />
It still is a straightforward choice and is actually the same as Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Go to control panel and click on the Folder Options icon. When the folder options windows opens look on the General tab for the section marked 'click items as follows.' Now click on the radio button next to the option 'single click to open an item (point to
 select)'. Finally click the OK button to enable the option.

As far as I understood, you make calls to landlines or mobile phones. It is a promotion campaign that offers free calls to the US and Canada from India and has some limitations covered here:

    <title>Bluetooth Keyboard&#47;Mouse making me crazy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindy.c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Keyboard&#47;Mouse making me crazy</h2>
                    Running Vista 32bit Ultimate with SP1<br />
Running Latest IntelliPoint and IntelliType<br />
Have one of those Microsoft Bluetooth rechargable keyboard/mouse sets.<br />
<br />
Evertime the system sleeps, I can giggle the mouse to wake up the system.&nbsp; But after it resumes Vista disables than reenable the the bluetooth dongle and it takes 30-60 seconds for me to be able to use the mouse and keyboard again.<br />
<br />
It is so annoying and seemingly un-nessary with the keyboard and mouse are pre-patched to the bluetooth dongle.&nbsp; What the heck is going on, and how do I make this thing work correctly on resume from sleep.

            Cindy,<br />
I suggest you disable the bluetooth function at least for testing.<br />
Bluetooth does provide improvements in the wireless arena. It does look however that you may be better served for the time being to disable it. You may not even notice any performance differences.

<p><span>Cindy.C<br />
I have a few suggestions for you to test.<br />
First, I would like you to uninstall all keyboard and mouse software and test the responsiveness from the resume.</span></p>
<p><span>You have stated that switching to Hardware Mode improved the responsiveness. What is the response time now?</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Under Programs, click Uninstall a program. Locate the IntelliPoint and IntelliType software, select
 each one at a time, and click Uninstall. Follow the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may be necessary for us to completely uninstall the drivers as well. Follow David’s previous steps for this and do choose to delete
 the drivers from the system (Make sure you have a means of reacquiring the drivers, either through a download or disk incase this is necessary). Then you restart your computer (after you have uninstalled the software as well) and then allow vista to locate
 your K/M drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Second, check if your Bluetooth device has an option in device manager to turn off during standby and disable this.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start -&gt; right-click Computer -&gt; Click Manage -&gt; confirm UAC -&gt; Click Device Manager from the left menu -&gt; Locate your Blue
 tooth device from the menu on the right (it may be under HID). When you locate it, right-click on it and click Properties. When the window opens, confirm if there is a Power Management tab. Uncheck
<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know how these suggestions play out.
</span></p>

<h2>            como cambiar de 64 bits a 32 bits para poder usar flash player</h2>
                    
<p>Se está ejecutando Microsoft Windows Vista con una versión de 64 bits de Internet Explorer, el&nbsp;problema que&nbsp;tengo es que cada imagen y / o video que intento ver en línea me pide que tenga adobe flash player&nbsp;y cuando intento descargar me dice que no es compatible
 en 64 bits pero si es compatible con un navegador de 32 bits. ¿Podemos cambiar nuestro navegador de 64 bits a 32 bits o se puede descargar un navegador de 32 bits para Vista, ¿como lo realizo? segui los pasos de una respueta que dio usted pero no tengo iexplore.exe
 parece que me faltan complementos como dio en una de sus respuestas, digame dichos complementos como lo obtengo?<br />
Gracias por su respuesta</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 takes long to establish wifi connection</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS with Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;It takes about a minute to establish a connection with my wifi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very annoying to have to wait the minute and often retry to connect, every time I reopen my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Macbook running OSX 10.13 that connects to my wifi instantly.</p>

            Hi Jeff, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I've got two suggestions which may help your WiFi connect quicker. Firstly, try reinstalling the WiFi adapter drivers:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your WiFi adapter in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Secondly, see if power cycling your WiFi router fixes the issue. Simply unplug the power from it, wait 30 seconds, then plug it back in and wait a minute for it to reboot.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Let me know how you go!

                    Why does the Internet icon at the bottom right of my computer screen sometimes have a yellow or red X over it?&nbsp; It still connects to the internet.&nbsp; This started happening about a month ago and it seems since then my computer will time-out often when I

    <title>Is 128 gb enough&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is 128 gb enough&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I had 2 Yoga 720 keyboards go south on me this month and decided to try a Surface Pro. I wanted to invest least due to practicality and opted for the 128 gb&nbsp;Core i5 model on sale yesterday at BB for 799. That said, after loading all my needs, syncing
 only the One Drive folders to Surface that I use frequently, uninstalling&nbsp;crappy stuff like Candy Crush, and putting on my own lightweight email client (Sylpheed), I have 77 gb left. I use her primarily for Office, email, browsing, watching YouTube and well,
 that is about it. I do not store anything directly to it but to OneDrive instead. Does anyone see a need for me to consider the 256 gb model.&nbsp;Thanks.

            I have a surface pro as well and only have 40GB of space left and it runs fine.
<br />I did however buy an external 1TB USB drive that i use for backups etc.
<br />So you will be fine.
<br />The other thing to consider when you say you store everything in Onedrive you might not want to sync all folders if you don't need to.
<br />I saved about 10GB once un-checking folders to not sync.  But they are still in onedrive if i need them and can get to them through the browser login.
<br />
<br />Also make sure you buy an external USB drive and put your recovery drive on there.

</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common occurrence if at some point you factory reset your Xbox and you re-added a different account that does not own the license to the game.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to verify the date of purchase, or in this case the date of code redemption, and that you are logging into the right account, I recommend reviewing your Microsoft Account order history on&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/orders</a>.
 You can extend the purchase history past the 90 days it displays and go back over a year to locate the purchase/redemption. If you cannot find it, then you redeemed the code/purchased the game on a different account and it would be best to contact customer
 support to help you out verifying what games your account owns.</p>

    <title>Logitech Squeezebox--Windows 7---Microsoft Security Essentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael j evans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech Squeezebox--Windows 7---Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    I use a device from Logitech called Squeezebox to play my music on iTunes wirelessly through my stereo system.&nbsp; I have a new pc running Windows 7 and Microsoft Security Essentials, and I am having difficulty getting the Logitech software to do a file-scan
 of my iTunes.&nbsp; Logitech support emailed me this, but I don't have any idea what to do with this:<br />
<br />
As per our conversation here is a list of exceptions that need to be made for your firewall,<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Squeezebox\server\Bin\MSWin32-x86-multi-thread\socketwrapper.exe<br />
C:\Program Files\Squeezebox\server\Bin\MSWin32-x86-multi-thread\mysqld.exe<br />
C:\Program Files\Squeezebox\server\Scanner.exe<br />
C:\Program Files\Squeezebox\Server\Squeezesvr.exe<br />
C:\Program Files\Squeezebox\Server\squeezesvc.exe<br />
<br />
If you have a firewall enabled you may need to forward the following ports: <br />
<br />
Port number: 3483 (TCP) - Name: Server Control <br />
Port number: 3483 (UDP) - Name: ServerDiscovery <br />
Port number: 9000 (TCP) - Name: Server Web <br />
Port number: 9090 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br />
Port Number: 9092 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />

<span><span>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
a) What exactly happens when Logitech scans the files in ITunes?<br />
b) Do you get any error message?<br />
c) Were you able to scan the files previously?<br />
d) Did you make any changes to your computer recently?<br />
<br />
Check if the Logitech Squeezebox model that you have is compatible with Windows 7 or not using the following link:<br />

<br />
<span>To add a port to firewall exception list and allow a program</span></span><span><span> to communicate through
<span>Windows</span> Firewall, follow the articles below:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span><span>Open a port in

<h2>            Issues with original Xbox games after hard drive transfer on my 360</h2>
                    
<p>I finally upgraded my 120 GB hard drive on my Xbox 360 console to a 250 GB drive. &nbsp;I used the transfer cables and followed the directions exactly. &nbsp;Everything works fine except my original Xbox games won't start now. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if it's disc or downloaded.
 &nbsp;I redownloaded the games, cleared the cache, everything I could think of, but to no avail. &nbsp;Does anybody have any ideas?</p>

<p>1. BSOD CRITICAL_PROCESS_FAILED appears after 100% completion of chkdsk/f;</p>
<p>2. Same BSOD appears when restarting after chkdsk completion;</p>
<p>3. There's no BSOD neither right after completion nor restart, but Windows runs into automatic repair.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 Pro 64 bits. Otherwise my PC runs just fine, I ran chkdsk/f because I should be doing this once in a while. If I skip chkdsk/f I can enter Windows without any problem, maybe a bit slower. Your feedback is greatly appreciated</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
3rd party antivirus tend to cause a lot of issue. Uninstall AVG and then run its maker's<br />
Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in<br />
Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there WD is a true<br />
superstar in detection and compatibility.<br />
<br />
AVG Removal Tool<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - The User Profile Service failed the sign-in User Profile cannot be loaded</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I get this error when trying to add family members to a recently upgraded laptop (from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The User Profile Service failed the sign-in User Profile cannot be loaded"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen numerous posts to this forum but no one seems to be able to offer a solution, I don't want to mess with the registry as this is high risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our other computer, upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 did not have the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been on going for at least 3 months and I cannot believe that Microsoft have not provided a suitable answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperate for a solution</p>

            Yeah your ntuser.dat file seems corrupted.&nbsp; You can attempt to download one from some questionable source but I would suggest to just download the windows 10 install iso from here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10.&nbsp; You should
 then be able to extract the ntuser.dat file from it.&nbsp; I posted the steps above so let me know if you get stuck on any of them.
