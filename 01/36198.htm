    <title>Remote Desktop Invalid Credentials - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Invalid Credentials</h2>
                    <p>I'll start with pointing out that it's rare there's a problem I can't fix myself, but I've found one and I can't find a solution for it anywhere online. I'm good doing just about any technical things involved in fixing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, I have my Surface Pro 2, physically using it works fine, but when I attempt to login remotely with Remote Desktop Connection, it connects, says my pre-entered username and password don't work, (which it should) so it asks for one, I've tried both
 my Microsoft Account (which I use to log in physically and remotely on my Desktop) and I've tried using the local credentials given to me by the Remote Desktop Assistant (which says everything's fine). No credentials work. To clarify, RDC does connect to the
 computer it just won't accept any credentials that I know are valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I have on multiple occasions noted that, when logging in locally, sometimes a second account shows up in the lower left corner, with the same name. As though I have two accounts. I bought that might have something to do with the problem,
 like it thinks there's multiple accounts with the same credentials so it just fails to log in with those credentials. But that "ghost" account only shows up every once in a while and never shows up in the Accounts section of Settings or Control Panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the inconvenience, but I've gotten rather annoyed with this issue and would rather not recount all the steps I've taken to attempt to resolve the issue. I'm willing to just do as told and return the results of any instructions in an attempt
 to fix the problem. I haven't tried a complete image backup and restore, I'd be willing to, though it'd be rather inconvenient and I don't think that would solve the problem, but if someone else does, I'll try it after trying some other things first.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Under Manage Payment Options, Cannot Select Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Under Manage Payment Options, Cannot Select Microsoft Account</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Support,</p>

<p>Here is my problem:</p>
<p>On my Xbox 360, I am trying to Renew my Xbox Live Gold Membership with the balance on my Microsoft Account. When I select 'Confirm Purchase', I am told there is 'No Payment Option Found'. I select 'Add Payment Option' &nbsp;and &nbsp;I see my Microsoft Account, with
 its balance, but it is grayed out and unselectable.</p>

<p>Some Additional Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>I purchased a Xbox $25 Prepaid Card to pay it with and added it to the current balance on my Xbox.
</li><li>The balance before adding the above amount was converted from Microsoft Points
</li><li>The total of the prepaid card amount and the previous balance appears to be incorrect. $25 + $7.50(ish) does not sum to the $40.66.
</li><li>I don't have a credit card to add as a payment option </li></ul>

<div>How do I access the money in my account?</div>

                </div>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You cannot use your Microsoft Account balance to renew your LIVE membership. This has never been possible, and no one has ever said you were able to previously.
<br />
<br />
You can only use your Microsoft Account balance on items in the Xbox LIVE Marketplace and the Windows Phone store. You can only purchase a Xbox LIVE Gold Membership using a subscription card purchased from a retail store, or using a payment method such as a
 credit or debit card.<br />
<br />
More information in regards to your Microsoft Account balance can be found <strong>
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/pointsfaq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the time I went to pay for a coffee with a gift card but the coffee shop wasn't accepting their own gift cards. I went very sleepy that day.</p>
<p>Can this issue be resolved without me giving Microsoft another $25?</p>

<p>Sorry, that's not possible. You can still use that money in your Microsoft Account balance on items in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
In the future, please remember that Xbox LIVE Gold membership subscription cards are color coded in green with white lettering (3 month/12 month cards) and currency token cards ($25/$50) are white with green lettering.</p>

<p>If anyone else is having this issue, the fastest way to get a solution is to speak with someone on Xbox Support: 1-800-469-9269.</p>
<p>I told them my problem, and how it was not very obvious that I couldn't buy an Xbox Live Gold Membership using my Microsoft Account. They resolved my problem by emailing me a code for a free 12 months of Gold and I still have the balance on my Microsoft
 Account. </p>
<p>Considering I only wanted one month of Gold, this greatly exceeded my expectations, and I am now back online.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I just did the same thing. This is ridiculous. Nowhere on the card does it say you can't purchase a membership. Whats the difference I bought a $25 card a 3month membership is $24.99 . &nbsp;

<h2>            Looking for parents of children with autistic spectrum disorder who use xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'm the dad of a 14yr old girl who has recently been diagnosed with aspergers syndrome with autistic traits also.&nbsp; She has the classic difficulty&nbsp;of social interaction but as she's an avid gamer i thought it would be an opportunity to meet likeminded kids&nbsp;to
 hopefully&nbsp;build up&nbsp;each others&nbsp;confidence in a relaxed and fun way; without the pressure, and at&nbsp;their own pace.</p>
<p>She is a big fan of the fable series and also likes oblivion, the lego games, bully, and loads more.</p>
<p>Initially, i'd love to meet parents of children on the autistic spectrum and introduce my daughter to new friends gradually.&nbsp; If anyone outthere is interested; i'd love to hera from you.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Blue Zoo 67</p>

<p>Hi. I have a 13yr old girl, who is severely autistic. She was diagnosed at only 21 months. &nbsp;She's great with computers and electronics in general but doesn't play games and is non-verbal. &nbsp;I'm the gamer in the family but I'm very new to xbox. Do you play
 as well? Feel free to add me, if you'd like.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm not a parent, but I am a 19 year old who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I, too, am quite socially awkward and Xbox is my way of occupying my time, as a result, I too am a relatively avid gamer, when I have the time to game, as I'll be starting
 University soon which means I will have to game when I have the time between studying.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to do what you are describing can only be done using a&nbsp;program that is capable of performing 'non-destructive' partitioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The following are recommended partitioning tools (Free) that are easy to use and capable of performing non-destructive partition resizing.
 Both of these products have been around for many years are very stable.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Add textures to 3D Builder</h2>
                    I would like to know how you can add textures to 3D builder. Not how to apply them to the model, but to actually add custom textures into the option tray for use.
                </div>

<p>You can "Load" your custom texture images by clicking the check mark next to the "selected" texture when the "paint" menu is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when starting a new model it forgets my custom texture location and I have to navigate to it all over again. Accessing the \TextureBitmaps&nbsp; folder is not possible because it is unshared and I can't get sharing turned on. It seems to be locked up tighter
 than a drum, which is good because someone might get into the Builder textures and substitute pornography for marble.&nbsp; My intent was to dump my commonly used bitmap textures in the Builder folder for easy access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be might handy if Builder could remember the folder where my textures are located.&nbsp; Make it configurable in settings?</p>

    <title>Wrong drive booting, even when disabled in BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. fireball  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong drive booting, even when disabled in BIOS</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 on a new SSD, and it booted wonderfully. All was going well until I plugged my old hard drive back in with Windows 8.1 on it. My plan was to wipe it through the disk management tool on the SSD. I have tried countless times
 in the BIOS, but no matter how I arrange the boot order, the hard drive always prevails. I even went to disable every device that could boot except for the SSD and the hard drive still won. Anything helps, thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Are you able to boot to the PC?</p>
<p>2. If yes, are you booting into Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my understanding, it seems that you have plugged the old hard drive with Windows 8. You are however unable to remove the old OS and your PC boots into Windows 8 instead of 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above is true, I suggest that you perform the steps below and check if you are able to make Windows 10 load as default.</p>
<p>1. Tab on<strong> Win+R</strong>, this will open <strong>Run Command.</strong></p>
<p>2. In the dialog box type, <strong>msconfig </strong></p>
<p>3. In the window under <strong>Boot</strong> tab, check if you can view both the OS.</p>
<p>4. If so, select&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 </strong>and click on the<strong> Set as Default
</strong>button.</p>
<p>5. Once done click on <strong>Apply, OK </strong>and &nbsp;reboot the system and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>pairing surface with microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinberner  say:</h3>
<h2>            pairing surface with microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I lost the Bluetooth pairing between my Surface and my MS Sculpt Mobile Keyboard.&nbsp; This has happened occasionally in the past.&nbsp; I would go through Change PC Settings/Bluetooth and turn on the power switch on the MS Sculpt.&nbsp; My Surface recognized the Sculpt
 and said it was ready to pair.&nbsp; When I clicked the pair button, the Surface would generate a password (about 8 random digits, if I recall, and different each time I had to pair), and ask me to type it into the Sculpt, and the paring would be complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That no longer happens.&nbsp; When I go through Change PC Settings/Bluetooth and then get the Surface to recognize the Sculpt and click the pair button, the Surface now asks me to enter the Sculpt's password.&nbsp; It says I will find it on the Sculpt (no I won't;
 I've checked and it is not there), or in the documentation that came with it (long since discarded).&nbsp; Can't find any advice already on the Microsoft site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Two observations:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; symefa appears to be related to some Norton/Symantec thing called "Symantec Extended File Attributes" that seems related to Unix file data, so why it's present on a Windows system is a good question.&nbsp;<a href="http://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-Internet-Security-Norton/system-volume-information-EfaData-SYMEFA-DB-is-corrupt-amp/td-p/303590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">One
 post I saw connects it with Norton Internet Security 2010/2011</a> and suggests that uninstalling NIS using the<a href="http://us.norton.com/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080710133834EN&amp;ln=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Norton Removal Tool</a> will solve the
 problem.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The System Volume Information folder is a "super hidden" folder that is not normally accessible.&nbsp; This is where Windows XP stores the System Restore points and<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/20/55764.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">some other information
 important to the operating system</a> .&nbsp; I suspect that Norton/Symantec has decided to take advantage of the super hidden nature of this folder to hide some of its own stuff.&nbsp; You can gain access to System Volume Information as described here<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309531</a>
 and delete the offending file.&nbsp; But I'd get rid of NIS first and then delete the file.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Remove recently added hardware</strong><br />
If you have added new hardware recently, use these steps.<br />

</p>
<p><em>NOTE:&nbsp;If a new internal device (sound card, hard drive, or other) was added to the computer before the error message started to occur, you must remove it before continuing.</em><br />
</p>
<ul>

</li><li>Plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Turn on the computer.&nbsp;The monitor displays the message again. Allow the timer to count down to zero.</li><li>If the error opens again, skip to the next step.<br />
</li><li>If the computer successfully starts to the Windows desktop and the error message is not displayed, reconnect one device and wait until Windows recognizes it.</li><li>Continue connecting the devices, one at a time, restarting the computer each time, until you find the device that is causing the error. Do not use the device that causes the error.</li></ul>
<p><em>NOTE:Wait until Windows completely starts before reconnecting the devices. If you have a problem, check technical support for the problem device for known issues, resolutions, updated drivers, and troubleshooting information.</em></p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off the computer.</li><li>Remove all attached devices except the mouse, keyboard, and monitor.</li><li>Turn on the computer and press the F8 key repeatedly when the first logo screen is displayed.<br />
A Windows startup screen is displayed.</li><li>Use the Up or Down arrow key to highlight Safe Mode with Command Prompt, and press Enter.</li><li>If the error message displays again, skip to the next step to perform a system recovery.</li><li>When the login screen is displayed, select Administrator, and type the password (if applicable).</li><li>When the command window is displayed, type the following at the command prompt, and press Enter:<br />
cd restore</li><li>At the new prompt, type the following: rstrui</li><li>Then press Enter.</li><li>The System Restore screen opens.</li><li>Restore system files and settings window</li><li>Click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.</li><li>Select a restore point before the errors began to occur, and then click Next. Follow the on-screen instructions to restore the computer to a time when the errors did not occur.<br />
</li><li>When finished, the computer restarts and tries to open Windows. If the error is still displayed after using System Restore, continue to the next step to recover the computer.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Recover the computer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the error continues after the using System Restore, perform a system recovery to reset the computer to its original configuration.</li></ul>

<h2>            Upgrade Vista to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp; desktop PC running Windows 10. My son recently gave me a Dell Latitude e6400 laptop running Vista, which he no longer uses.</p>
<p>I would like to upgrade Vista on the Dell to Windows 10. Am I able to use the Windows 10 program on my desktop on the Dell laptop? The Dell would basically be a copy of the desktop, and would give me portability when travelling.</p>
<p>If so, please tell me how.</p>
<p>If not, please tell me the easiest way to upgrade Vista to W10 on the Dell laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Problem with downloading Design Doll</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've found this amazing program called Design Doll. I wanted to try it out, so I opened the download page
<a href="http://terawell.net/terawell/?page_id=56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, clicked "Download"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all I got was a "Page was not found" and "error connection failure" from my webbrowser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was about a week ago. I've been retrying to download the program the entire week since then, and every time the result was the same. I don't know what could be the problem, any other program downloads just fine. Can anyone help me, please?</p>

</p><p><span>Which browser are you using to download the program? Did you check if the persists with other browsers as well? The download seems to work fine for me, I would suggest
 you to use Internet Explorer, add the website in compatibility mode and try to download and check if it helps.

            <p>Hello. Thank you for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Yandex Browser to try to download, but I tried some other browsers too like Firefox and Microsoft Edge (I have Windows 10). I also tried Internet Explorer like you suggested. It's still the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, I don't quite understand how to add a website in compatibility mode. Could you explain to me? Also, when I tried to download with IE, there was a message about "missing network protocols". Could that have anything to do with the problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Sia,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might arise due to issues with the network itself which may include router or internet. We need to further diagnose if the issue is with the PC itself or not as such issues will not cause connectivity issues for all the systems on
 the network.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try the following methods to diagnose and fix this issue.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode with Networking, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>

            <p>Hello. Thank you very much for trying to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried the safe mode with networking. Unfortunately when I activated the safe mode the network system simply did not work. The message went something like this "The settings can't be opened with the use of the installed administrator mode." On top of
 that, the sound system did not work too, same with Windows Search, and when I tried to open Update and Security, the window just closed. I was able to get back to the normal mode, but I'm sure this option is not for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I tried the Clean Boot. The page doesn't open still. But at least the "missing network protocols" problem is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm using an Asus Ultrabook, which doesn't have an ethernet socket given its smaller size. Wi-Fi only.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any external devices connected to the system (except mouse and keyboard)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the sound that notifies connecting an external hardware, then probably some external hardware (including some Bluetooth device) is not connected properly and so you get the notification. In order to diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to disconnect
 all the hardware devices connected to system except mouse and keyboard and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is not reproduced, then attach the external devices one by one and eliminate the hardware device causing the issue.</p>
<p>
