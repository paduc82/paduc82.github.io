    <title>Can&#39;t connect to the Internet when using Wired and wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohsie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to the Internet when using Wired and wireless connection at the same time.</h2>
                    
<p>I have both wired and wireless connection on my desktop PC running Windows Vista Ultimate SP1. The wired connection is permanently connected to the Internet via a Cable modem, with absolutely no problems at all. I have now added a wireless LAN adapter to
 the PC so I can create a private wireless network to connect the&nbsp;wireless printer, as well as to get access to the internet on my mobile/cell phone using WLAN via Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) or using third party proxy server software (I have previously
 used Fortech Proxy+ 3.0). At first I created an ad-hoc network, and connected the printer and the phone via the ad-hoc network and it all worked fine. I could access the Internet fine from the PC, and using Proxy+, from the phone too. However, I had two "minor"
 problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; </li></ol>
</li><li>Everytime Windows was restarted, I had to manually connect the PC to the ad-hoc network. It would not auto-connect as it does with an infrastructure network. This soon became a pain.
</li><li>The wireless network range on an ad-hoc network is limited to around 30m, as opposed to 100m on the infrastructure. In a building, this distance is MUCH smaller. In short, I could only use the phone if I was in the same room as the PC, which is pretty useless,
 because then I could just use the wireless keyboard and mouse and use the PC itself!
</li></ol>
<p>So I decide to bring out my old D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router to help fix these two issues. However, when I connect to the wireless router using the WLAN Adapter, all the programs that are using the Internet (e.g MSN, IE, Google Chrome, Gmail etc) get disconnected.
 All the programs, including IE, get disconnected from the Internet as they&nbsp;start trying to use the new wireless connection to connect to the Internet. Windows Vista's Network and Sharing Centre correctly identifies that the wired connection is "local and Internet"
 and the wireless connection is "local only". Yet, it still tries to connect via the wireless connection. This problem does not happen when the wireless connection is in "ad-hoc mode", but only when it is in "infrastructure mode". When I disconnect the wireless
 connection, everything is back to normal, and all the programs simply reconnect&nbsp;using the wired connection. Any idea what's going on?</p>

            Hi mohsie<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Winsock is the standard Windows API utility that uses TCP/IP protocol to connect other network devices.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The command Pibes has you run <strong>resets Winsock Catalog</strong> to a clean state or default configuration. It removes all Winsock LSP (Layered Service Providers) previously installed, including the potential malfunctioned LSP that causes loss of network
 packets transmission failure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ad-Hoc</strong><br />
On wireless computer networks, <strong>ad-hoc</strong> mode is a method for wireless devices to directly communicate with each other. Operating in ad-hoc mode allows all wireless devices within range of each other to discover and communicate in peer-to-peer
 fashion without involving central access points (including those built in to broadband wireless routers).
<p>To set up an ad-hoc wireless network, each wireless adapter must be configured for ad-hoc mode versus the alternative
<strong>infrastructure mode</strong>. In addition, all wireless adapters on the ad-hoc network must use the same SSID and the same
<strong>channel number</strong>.</p>
<p>An ad-hoc network tends to feature a small group of devices all in very close proximity to each other. Performance suffers as the number of devices grows, and a large ad-hoc network quickly becomes difficult to manage. Ad-hoc networks cannot bridge to wired
 LANs or to the Internet without installing a special-purpose gateway.</p>
<p>Ad hoc networks make sense when needing to build a small, all-wireless LAN quickly and spend the minimum amount of money on equipment. Ad hoc networks also work well as a
<strong>temporary</strong> fallback mechanism if normally-available infrastructure mode gear (access points or routers) stop functioning.
<br />
<br />
Are you now using the Wireless Router for your Wireless Connections?&nbsp; If so, you should not need to use ad-hoc.&nbsp; Simply create the SSID in the Router and point all Wireless Devices to that SSID.</p>
<p>It sounds like you know what you're doing.&nbsp; My apologies if I have misunderstood your issue/question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FYI</span></strong>:&nbsp; It's generally not a good idea to use Wired and Wireless at the same time as you can produce Data congestion as the programs may get confused and not know which path to use, wired or wireless.&nbsp;
 The applications may attempt to send out packets on wired during one session then wireless the next session, causing issues, such as timeouts, or lose of connectivity.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to Internet... The modem does not see my computer...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 Internet providers at home, the RCN and Service Electric (SE). Both are cable companies. I have 3 computers. I'm able to connect all 3 comp. to the RCN and only one of those to SE. The SE modem is hard wired, not wireless. The RCN is both. What
 could be the problem? Why would I be able to connect to one network and not the other?</p>
<p>Currently I'm able to connect my Vista laptop to SE. When I try connecting the Win7 laptop or my HP Vista Desktop to the SE modem then the PC activity light on that modem is off, which means the modem does not see those computers. Few days ago I was able
 to connect my desktop to this modem. Then all of a sudden I lost the connection and since then I'm not able to connect to SE. Then I replaced the modem to the new one thinking this maybe the modem problem - did not help. I'm still able to connect only one
 of 3 computers to SE and all comps. to RCN. I tried to troubleshoot... Did not help. I think if I'm able to connect to one of the networks then it is not the Network card problem...? The cable modem - Motorola SB5101 is brand new...</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Most Internet services maintain a form of authentication (like password and ID).</p>
<p>One of the functions of a Router is to perform this authentication so that the connection will stay alive for all Network computers.</p>
<p>The MAC address (or some other parameter) of your working on RCN computer is used for authentication, Thus when you put another computer it does not authenticate, and the connection is refused.</p>

            <p>Thanks - I tried this, but it did not work.&nbsp; When I did the F8, the computer restarts but comes right back up to the loop.&nbsp; Instead of a configuring message, I now have a "Windows getting ready" message and it just spins until the laptop runs out of battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get any options to reboot or screens to be able to type any commands.&nbsp; Guess I just lost 5 years of pictures and data because I cannot get them off the computer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update error &#40;0x80080008&#41; due to Windows Updater - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gfromb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update error &#40;0x80080008&#41; due to Windows Updater Service continually shown as stopping</h2>
                    <p>The problem started with Apps store downloads freezing on my PC, which has subsequently prevented Windows 10 Updates from loading. The problem appears to be that the Windows Update Service is always in a state of 'stopping', even when the computer is re-booted
 the next day. When trying to force the Windows Update Service to shut down by going to the command prompt and entering 'net stop wuauserv' it produces the message 'The service is starting or stopping' and no change occurs. I have tried just about every remedy
 I can find on-line, including using windows troubleshooter tools and creating batch files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions greatly received.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have caused due to some windows update files corruption. We will help you try resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>Perform a
</span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> and check if the issue persists.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow: </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If issue still persists I would suggest you to manually
<strong><span>reset Windows Update components</span></strong> and for that try to run the
<strong><span>fixit</span></strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately the clean boot method 1 reference and the 'How do I reset Windows Update components' both refer to windows 8.1 and lower. They also seem a little complicated. I have therefore done a system restore which temporarily at
 least enabled me to get the latest Windows updates. However, I know that if I go to the Apps Store and try to update or download any apps the system will freeze again as I&nbsp; have been through this cycle before. So, unless there is a way of preventing the apps
 updater freezing I have decided that I shall simply not visit the apps store again.</p>
<p>Regards GfromB</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for getting back with a reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise when there are issues with the Windows update components.
</span><span>As of now, I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Check the System Date and Time on your computer.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let’s first check if the system date and time are correct. If they are showing incorrect values, then follow the steps below and correct the time and date according to your time zone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong><span>Windows key +&nbsp;R key </span></strong>on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong><span>“control" </span></strong>and click <strong><span>on "Date and Time".</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. Click <strong><span>Change date and time button (To change the time zone click on time zone tab).</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <strong><span>Apply </span></strong>and <strong><span>Ok </span>
</strong>to save the date and time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists try method 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: Run the Windows Update troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may also run the fixit “Windows Update troubleshooter “from the article below and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Update troubleshooter makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.</span></p>

            <p>Since doing the system restore, the updating error has disappeared, but so has the Windows Store. Fortunately, I am not an avid music or games downloader so I shall simply have to manage without the store and associated apps such as Mail, Calendar, X-box
 and solitaire suite. As far as I am concerned this thread is closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB Despite following other threads on how to re-install Windows Store I have been unsuccessful. Why cannot the Windows Store be simply installed/uninstalled like any other programme or app?</p>

<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Other reasons why it might not be there:</p>
Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>
<p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

            Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.

</p><p>Network adapter and security password are common network connection issues. The lock symbol on the Wi-Fi icon means that your wireless connection has a password. Try clicking the Wi-Fi symbol and enter the password to access your wireless network again.</p>

<br />That is based in whether Cortana decides if you are using your computer. 
<br />
<br />If Cortana does not detect input in the last few seconds, it will open the full-screen overlay. 
<br />
<br />If Cortana detects input it will only open a small box in the corner so as not to disturb your work

<p>In other words it's astoundingly bad design.&nbsp; It should never open full screen on a desktop unless I specifically want it to.&nbsp; Guess what, when it opens full screen it just stays there.&nbsp; Very poor design indeed.</p>

            They get a lot of submissions. I have been pleasantly surprised to see a couple of things I submitted or voted for have been implemented.  But that is out of hundreds of ideas I've submitted.
<br />
<br />I really appreciate this tool because for the first time in 25 years of using MS products I can make suggestions that a real person at MS sees and acts on. The most common (and useless) action is simply a note saying "we see this".  Granted, favorable actions (ie "we are working on implementing this idea") are in the realm of "flying pigs", but there is a chance.
<br />
<br />One of the basics of this feedback creature is to remember that unless the idea comes with it's own fireworks or instantly recognizable "eureka!" moment, feedback is in part a popularity contest.  So share a link to your feedback with anyone you are in contact who would be willing to vote for it AND comment on the significance of the idea.  Granted, simple vote counts don't always win, but they do help.

                    Just bought this laptop with this version of windows 8.1 and didn't got a chance to reserve for upgrade. I'm now attempting to upgrade using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool but could not figure out what version of Windows 10 to get. It says in their
 how-to (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install?ocid=ms_wol_win10) that<span>
<strong>Windows&nbsp;8</strong></span><strong>/8.1 Single Language<span> and Windows&nbsp;8</span> Single Language with Bing
</strong>users<span> should select the <strong>Windows&nbsp;10</strong></span><strong> Home Single Language</strong> edition and that
<strong><span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> with Bing</strong> users select the regular <strong>

                    <p>I have a Dell XPS computer and the keyboard suddenly stopped working due to a driver signature verification issue. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 7 x64. &nbsp;I've tried the following: i) Windows updates, ii) updating drivers from Dell, iii) system restore to a known working

    <title>Dual monitor defaults to duplex when picking extended. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nico vh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual monitor defaults to duplex when picking extended.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using a laptop (HP EliteBook 8560p with ATI gfx) at work with windows 7 enterprise (32bit).</p>
<p>I used this in the past with a beamer and had no problem extending my desktop so that I can have one program open on the beamer and another one on my laptop screen to take notes of meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However recently I have gotten myself also a second monitor connected to the docking station and then the problems started. Since then I can't extend my desktop anymore to a second monitor or beamer. When I pick the extend option it reverts automaticly to
 duplex mode. With the newer beamers here at work there isn't a problem as they can handle the same resolution as my laptopscreen. However with the second monitor this isn't the case and is starting to annoy me a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already contacted our company technical support team (HP itself) with this problem. They logged in with an admin account and there wasn't any problem setting it up. It even stayed after relogging back to my own account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However next time when I had took the laptop out of the dockingstation and put it back in, the problem started all over again. My support helpdesk is also trying to find a solution but seems unable to solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I was wondering if anyone here has encountered the same problem and could provide a solution to how fix this.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the server list is empty when you try to play the online version of Halo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try the steps mentioned in this link and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you try to list the available Microsoft Halo: Combat Evolved multiplayer servers, not all the servers are listed.</p>

            hi
<div><br />
<div>thank you so much for the quick response.. ive been working on this since thursdya of last week,is when it stopped working for me after playing this for i dont know maybe 5 to 6 years ,,but i have the demo version so i cannot remove the halo.exe file then
 replace it with the one from the disk which i dont have.. the other solution is to adjusters the filters by unlocking and locking tabs in the lobby,, they dont work either,,,,</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>i just recently did a good reinstall of my machine like a windows previouse good date install.. seems it brought back some of the original halo demo files i had.. one mistake i did was i delted halo demo that i had for a long time and reinstalled one i
 down loaded from filefront.com gamer site .. i think i should have left my halo demo original on there and just done a preveiouse window resintall date thing.. maybe that would have fixed this issue.. but to late now&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>im wondering this sounds like to me that its just updates of some kind that is causeing the problem?... but not that i have done a previouse install of the machine like pryer to the date it stopped working i would have thought this would have fixed it&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>im running windows xp pro and ive never had any issues in the 5 to 6 years i been playing this demo game.. i really like this game and chat with freinds from around the world .. please help...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            I wouldn't bother. Gamespy which runs the multiplayer has taken the Halo servers offline.<br />
<br />
There are no more mutliplayer games available through Gamespy HOWEVER if you know the direct IP address of the game you can still do that.<br />
<br />
Refer to this.<br />

            <p>I have the same problem and I have gone through the troubleshooting recommended here however It did NOT solve the problem.</p>
<p>Given that Microsoft is constantly updating the .net framework and makes the framework mandatory in Visual Studio this is a critical issue for developers. Creating Virtual machines to keep up with this incongruence is madness and cannot be the solution to
 this continuos problems that are somehow ignored by the ones responsible in Microsoft.</p>

            If I remember correctly I had to do a windows repair install by inserting the Windows 7 cd and run the upgrade install. &nbsp;After that ran the updates and the .net install. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

    <title>Windows 10 update took my hard drive space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaiarail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update took my hard drive space</h2>
                    <p>So here is my dilemma. I got the pop-up upgrade window yesterday telling me too update my operating system due to an unsupported old version of Windows 10. So of course I do that, then I get a message error saying the files cannot
 be installed. I don't remember what the error code was but I'm not sure its relevant if it has happened to anyone else. Now I wouldn't be this frustrated right now over the upgrade not working if I didn't just loose 5 gigs of space on my 36gig SSD. I had a
 windows Update sitting in the settings queue and I decided to install it thinking maybe that's why but alas, a new issue came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the queued windows update seems to have given me what I need, it took up 5 of the 8 gigs I need to upgrade. Now there is 4.44 gigs of "Old Windows" files sitting somewhere and I cannot delete them because I don't know where they are. The storage clean
 up system can't seem to clean them out and Disk Cleaner seems to not get them either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me how to find these files so I can delete them. I don't mind going through the upgrade process as I just installed the windows updates to make its work. I just want this issue gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to uninstall my Photoshop and all my programs because of this unnecessary push to upgrade my system.</p>

            Hi Gaia.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if you have C:\Windows.old folder.  If so you must choose to clean up System Files when running Disk Cleanup.  See here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/d...</a>
<br />
<br />That should mean you have Fall Creators Update Version 1709 which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  If not then I'd create the media for it or download the ISO - if necessary on another PC - to a flash stick to run it from outside Windows so it doesn't use up space for the download:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Open the media, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.
<br />
<br />There are good tips here for how to manage Windows and reclaim space on a 32gb SSD:

<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  The finished install will leave about half the drive for programs, and you can store files offline in OneDrive in the cloud or on another drive or SD card.  
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Clean Install Issue&#58; Windows could not complete the installation...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently completed a number of steps to do a clean install on my computer from bootable media (a USB drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have overcome many problems so far, and this problem ''Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation" i have not been able to overcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So..</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i start up my PC, the Windows logo appears, with the spinning circle, fades, another windows logo appears, with a spinning circle. From this, it goes to a Blue Screen, which says ''Just A Moment'', the circle on the Just A Moment screen cycles a couple
 of times before the screen turns black and goes to the error</p>
<p>
</p><p>''Windows could not complete the installation. To install windows on this computer, restart the installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how to fix this problem, and have tried multiple things to try and fix it like... the oobe method in the cmd. This just takes the screen back to the blue "Just a Moment" Screen where it just stays in that cycle for a long. long. time. I sat
 there for half an hour watching it go around in circles. Is it supposed to take this long? Or longer?</p>
<p>

            Hello Jamie,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please refer these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Press Shift+F10 key combination to bring Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />2. Execute these commands:
<br />
<br />cd oobe 
<br />
<br />msoobe
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you’re prompted to C:\Users\USERNAME (assuming Windows is installed on C:), use similar way to navigate to C:\Windows\system32\oobe
<br />
<br />3. This should fire up user account creation wizard, where you can set an user account. Once this is done, the issue should be resolved.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
