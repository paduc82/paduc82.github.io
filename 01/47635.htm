<h2>            After update lightroom doesnt work</h2>
                    I turned on my computer to one of the usual stupid updates. After it finished I opened up lightroom and now it's not working. I never had this problem before. Once lightroom loads a little window appears in front of it saying " Lightroom encountered an
 error when reading from it's preview cache and needs to quit. Lightroom will attempt to fix this problem the next time it launches." &nbsp;You can click "Ok" and once you do lightroom closes. I opened it several times only to have the same problem. I uninstalled
 the reinstalled and the problem is still there. I have windows 10 and have had it. I just used lightroom yesterday and now after another stupid update it's not working. Does anyone know what is wrong and how to fix this??? And how do you turn off the stupid
 updates!!!???

            <p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to know more information about the issue. Did you install the latest updates last September 29? Did this resolve the issue on Lightroom?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the latest Windows Updates installed on Windows 10, we suggest you to uninstall and reinstall Lightroom. Test if that can resolve the issue. If not, we recommend you to launch Lightroom and save logs for Application and System by following the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Event Viewer</strong> log by pressing <strong>Windows key+R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>eventvwr.msc</strong> and then click <strong>Windows Logs</strong>.</li><li>Right click <strong>Application</strong> and select <strong>Open Saved Log</strong>.</li><li>Save it in OneDrive.</li><li>Right click <strong>System</strong> and select <strong>Open Saved Log</strong>.</li><li>Save it in OneDrive</li><li>Send us the information you collect on Event Viewer log.</li></ol>
<p>This will help us isolate your concern and provide you the next step on resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Halo&#58; Reach Achievments not working &#40;all&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing Halo: Reach for a while now and i have been the last man standing several times on 'Infection', there is also an achievement for doing this, and yet it is still locked. Aswell as the achievement 'Emergency Room' I have downloaded all
 DLC for the game, including the 'Anniversary Pack' wich the achievements come under. It seems all other achivements so far are working fine just these two. I have even tried deleting and re dowloading the 'Anniversary Pack' but this didn't work as I guessed.</p>
<p>Some help with how to fix this would be much appreaciated, Thank You!</p>

<p>To get "All Alone" you need to be the last man standing on a Defiant map (Condemned or Highlands).</p>
<p>To get "Emergency Room" you need to infect 3 players in a single round on an Anniversary map (Battle Canyon, Penance, High Noon, Ridgeline, Solitary or Breakneck)</p>
<p>I noticed you are missing a few of the later added achievements, so keep in mind the same thing goes for them aswell. In the achievement description it might say "Defiant:" or "Anniversary:", which indicates what map pack you need to play to get the achievements.</p>

<p>AidedPlacebo - </p>
<p>The first set of DLC achievements from the Noble and Defiant maps were only game type specific. The new ones that were released with the CEA are, unfortunately, both game AND map specific. I don't know why the decision was made to lock them to certain maps
 but it certainly makes for the biggest pain in the rear ever. </p>
<p>Also, fun fact - Crackin' Skulls, Candy From a Baby, and Return to Sender can all be done in custom games with the official gametype saved from matchmaking. (ie, not the shipped/default game variants on the disc already.)
</p>
<p>OP - Hop into Anniversary FFA for the Emergency Room achievement. Living Dead games pop up in there and you KNOW it'll be on an Anniversary map when it does. For All Alone, I suggest you delete both Noble and Anniversary from your HD and then go into LD
 hoping and praying you miraculously end up in a lobby with 11 others that have the Defiant maps and that the show up. And then that people vote for it. :/
</p>
<p>Alternatively, try seeing if any of your friends have friends that they can bring to help full party search for it making sure that everyone has Defiant maps, of course. Removing Noble and Anniversary will, in theory, boost the Defiant DLC maps' presence
 with the increased DLC searching parameters applied by 343. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3> carltonthomas1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to reinstall the Marvell WiFi device S&#47;W after a deletion error.</h2>
                    Because I could not connect to my network, I thought I could uninstall the device and reinstall it. However, the device S/w has been removed from the device and I can't find the Marvell device S/W to reinstall in. PLEASE HELP ME FIND AND DOWNLOAD THE S/W.
 I'm running it on a Windows RT 8.1 machine with regular updates until I couldn't connect. I have an iMac and an iPad that connect just fine. Thank you!

<h2>            Windows 10 - automatic repair after memtest session - hardware faulty or not&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hello.</div>
<div>Eh getting weird problem with Windows 10 Pro.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So few days ago when i ran memtest few hours without error, but after finished test i reboot pc and Automatiic repair started before windows. Is this something with memory ? Memory trigger that error? Or it is software issue? Coincidence ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When starting Windows 10 boot loader starts by "preparing automatic repair" and diagnosing pc.</div>
<div>Interesting is that if I restart Windows (after procedure mentioned earlier) it will boot normally. This startup problem occurs only when starting system again after shutdown.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My disk is Samsung Evo 250 GB SSD. I run HD TUNE but no errors and CrystalDiskInfo Smart is fine 100% GOOD. Rams are 2x8gb DDR3 Kingston Hyperx 1600mhhz.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Memtest86 not showing errors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So its a hardware related or not? What you think about it ? Thx for answer.</div>

<div>Interesting is that if I restart Windows (after procedure mentioned earlier) it will boot normally. This startup problem was occured only when starting system again after shutdown or restarted pc from windows.So i am needing 2 boots to boot properly to
 windows.</div>
<div>So boot to windows is possible. And i am thinking that with faulty hardware i cant boot no matter how much boots.</div>
What you think?

            Also last thing. Somebody said this : "You should get zero auto repair attempts, otherwise it implies that there is something hardware related with the system/pc, if it happens very early after a clean OS install: you can't get rid of hardware issues with
 a clean OS install.<br />
<br />
"Automatic Repair" should engage after a failed attempt to start windows."<br />
<br />
<br />
So i dont know what to think about it, he stated that is hardware related for sure. What is your statement then ?&nbsp; Also after format is ok.

            <p>There are several threads on this topic.&nbsp; You should check them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround until this issue is addressed by MS is to NOT use Fast Startup, and/or to NOT use Hibernation and/or NOT have the charging cord attached while Hibernating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the power button settings to disable Fast Startup.&nbsp; You will not have any slower startups.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App Sync Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hax01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Sync Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the new Windows 10 on my Asus TF100 and have had to reinstall it 3 times just to get my Mail app from syncing my email correctly. I also had this problem on my PC having just installed and then reinstalled Win10 to get my emails from syncing
 again after they were for a short while. To note - My tablet is running Win10 Home and my PC is Win10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In detail - I first signed up with a local account&nbsp; (on both my systems) which after adding a hotmail account to the mail app simply didnt sync from the offset. I then linked my system to&nbsp;my particular hotmail account and then my emails finally began to
 sync upon request. Then eventually they didn't! So I reinstalled Win10 and during setup I linked my hotmail account from the offset leading to the emails syncing from the offset only to then eventually NOT working. So lo and behold&nbsp;I reinstalled Win10 again&nbsp;and
 here I am asking the following questions to other users and&nbsp;Microsoft. To note - All the email&nbsp;accounts added are HOTMAIL, not even Gmail/Yahoo etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Has anyone else had these same&nbsp;SYNC problems with their&nbsp;Win10 mail app thus far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;How can the mail app be uninstalled completely removing all information on any accounts (I know how to delete accounts from the app and in the user account settings section!) once added to the app from the system and then reinstalled?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) How can a mail app have such a FUNDAMENTAL BUG upon release. It defeats the purpose and makes&nbsp;our dependence on using the entire&nbsp;PC&nbsp;a nuisance. I'd rather use my ANDROID&nbsp;mail app which&nbsp;has worked flawlessly!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BONUS BUG) Email notifications and the apps live tile have yet to work! </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S - Dont tell me to just restart the system many times, cause there is only so many times a human can to no avail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

            <p>Thx Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to mention in my original message the sneeky suspicion I had that it may have to do with having the privacy issues with regard mail and calender consistent. Since I am using Win10 on both systems under the same hotmail account. Im a "Fox Mulder"
 for privacy so dont want ANY organisation no matter how transparent they are snooping at my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During my reinstalls upto last night when I posted my message, I ensured that all my user account sync settings were exactly the same. Which for me I have turned all options off except for</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; accounts &gt; sync your settings &gt; sync settings (on) &gt; other windows settings (on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that option is very vague in meaning, it may have something to do with mail and other app related syncing options. I have also ensured that all my in mail app user accounts syncing options are the same and dont use Microsofts touted 'based on usage'
 option since this may (oddly) cause the problem at hand to resurface if I use the mail app differently across multiple systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for those guys reading, do as Sean has mentioned in his other post (copied below)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings</li><li>Open the Privacy tab</li><li>Open the Contacts sub-menu</li><li>In the list of apps check that access for "App Connector" and "Mail and Calendar" are turned on</li><li>Open the Calendar sub-menu</li><li>Check the "Let apps access my Calendar" option is turned on</li><li>In the list of apps check that access for "App Connector" and "Mail and Calendar" are turned on.</li></ol>
<p>And maybe be as paranoid as I am and ensure all your syncing optioons are the same across all multiple systems that you may be running Win10 under the same user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, can Microsoft just make the whole thing less THIS and more a mail app upgrade to let us be using the app to our digital desire?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you dont get another reply bemoaning another syncing issue within the next month, you can assume it worked ... for me anyway :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Windows Update error 80070020, the cause might be a program running&nbsp; is interfering with Windows Update. This problem can often be solved by restarting the device and running Windows Update again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to restart the phone and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to install the remaining updates for your phone from the settings option and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>How can I create a Windows 8 installation DVD from a preinstalled OEM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aiarakoa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I create a Windows 8 installation DVD from a preinstalled OEM version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have bought an Acer Aspire V3-571G with an OEM version of Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually rather want to work with Ubuntu, so I plan to virtualize Windows 8 (something I think I am entitled to, according to the Personal Use License) just for certain tools I will not be able to run with WINE. But as there is no license key, I am not
 sure about whether I will be able to create an installation DVD and virtualize Windows 8 successfully from there; there is the system image thing from Windows 7 File Recovery, but it requires a considerable amount of blank DVDs and I am not sure about whether
 it would work. How can I do this? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just think that if this were not my case, if I just had any trouble with my laptop and had to reinstall Windows 8, I wouldn't be able to. Why this people make things so complicated?</p>

            <p>If Windows 8 came pre-installed with your Acer then no key is required (its imbedded in th BIOS). Check to see if you have a restore option when booting the PC (Acer: press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo).</p>

<p><br />
See the following steps for creating a backup of your Windows 8 installation which you can use to reinstall Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this first series, we check Acer’s built in recovery software, which is used to create recovery media or start the recovery process for reinstall Windows 8 if needs be.
</p>
<p>1. Go to the Start Screen and type: <strong>recovery</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d248" /></a></p>
<p>This will bring up the recovery link for Acer. Click on it to launch Acer’s Recovery program:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-1_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d347%26amp%3bh%3d151" /></a></p>
<p><em>Acers Recovery Management app</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d422%26amp%3bh%3d293" /></a></p>
<p>This will launch the Acer Recovery Management. Here on screen, you will see several options, which includes:</p>
<p><strong>Restore Factory Settings – </strong>this will restore your computer to its defaults factory state like it was when you first got it.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d413%26amp%3bh%3d287" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Customized Restore (Retain User Data) – </strong>Restores only the operating system to factory defaults. Your personal files are preserved with this option.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d403%26amp%3bh%3d280" /></a></p>
<p>The third option reinstalls the drivers and applications that came with your Acer computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-41.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-4_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d379%26amp%3bh%3d179" /></a></p>
<p>At the bottom of the window are additional options, which allows you create a backup on an external media device such as a USB thumb drive or DVD.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d456%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>You can use this as a backup option in case your drive fails. I suggest you do this, so for instance, if you move to a larger hard disk or change to an SSD (Solid State Drive), you can reinstall Windows 8.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/acer-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2facer-6_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d424%26amp%3bh%3d294" /></a></p>

Looks like you will have to invest in a USB thumb drive or consider requesting backup media from Acer which can take a long time.</p>

            I rather invested in a USB external hard drive, only using a 20 GB partition of it for the recovery disk. Do I need to make an additional recovery DVD, or it is enough with the 20 GB partition created by Acer Recovery Management?

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Firmware&#47;Driver Reinstall&#47;Update</h2>
                    I recently installed a new Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter on a Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; The device worked perfectly with a few extra keystrokes.&nbsp; Video and audio were perfectly in-sync.&nbsp; Then I mistakenly deleted the digital audio display driver that sends
 the audio portion of a display to my TV.&nbsp; I have tried to reinstall the firmware through Windows Store but the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Screen will not accept my password and there is no provision to change your password if it was forgotten.&nbsp; After
 3 1/2 hours on the phone with Microsoft I have given up on the password problem.&nbsp; All I would like to do is download the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Firmware or Drivers from somewhere.&nbsp; So far, no luck in finding an online source for the Firmware/Drivers.&nbsp;
 I would greatly appreciate if someone can point me to an obtainable source for the Firmware/Drivers.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if it helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check for Windows updates if any Windows update is available install the same, it should automatically download the driver and install.</span></p>
<p><span>Type “<strong>Updates</strong>” in the search bar and click on “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>” from the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>Now click on “<strong>Check for Updates”</strong> button on the right pane, to receive a fresh list of updates and then install all the updates listed there.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>For any issues while installing Windows Updates, you may also refer to this link:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persist try the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since it is not accepting your password, I would recommend you to un-install the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter and re-install the same from Windows store. Try creating a new password and check if it helps.</span></p>

            Nothing that you suggested works.&nbsp; Changing the Microsoft password for use in Windows Store does not work for the Firmware/Sign-in screen that is provided for Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp; This screen does not accept the password that I used for
 Windows Store.&nbsp; Also, this screen has no provision for a situation in which someone has forgotten their password.&nbsp; This screen is poorly designed for a forgotten password situation.&nbsp; Since the screen will not accept my Windows Store password I cannot update
 or reinstall the Firmware/Drivers for the Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp; This is a Microsoft problem.&nbsp; If Microsoft can't fix the password problem, please tell me where I can obtain the executable Firmware files or tell me what company provides the digital audio
 driver.&nbsp; Thank you.

            Solved the password problem by pressing the "Reset" button on the Display Adapter and holding until the indicator lamp began flashing.&nbsp; Then followed instructions on screen.&nbsp; This provided the ability to reinstall the original Firmware and set a new password.&nbsp;
 This still did not provide the required Digital Output device.&nbsp; Kept searching for the audio device in HP and Microsoft until the device was found as MicrosoftDisplayAd.&nbsp; Downloaded this and now the device is active.&nbsp; Spent a week to solve my problems.<br />

<h2>            Continuous duplicate charges</h2>
                    Has anyone else been charged a second time OR SO for the same charge??? &nbsp;This has happened to us on numerous occasions. &nbsp;I've tried contacting Microsoft through the back office, with no response! &nbsp;Of course we can't call them. &nbsp;This is happening in Microsoft
 XBox Live. &nbsp;I buy things from time to time for my sons there, inevitably, I get a bill emailed, IT COMES THROUGH BLANK!!!!. &nbsp;So I have to go into my actual account, most times there's 1-3 charges of the same thing, at same time!! &nbsp;Pretty shady!

    <title>High disk usage - System - ntoskrnl.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bombchu  say:</h3>
<h2>            High disk usage - System - ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've noticed in task manager that System(ntoskrnl.exe) has been using a ton of my disk. I've been able to recreate this by leaving my PC alone for a few minutes, but that's the only time I can consistently get it to happen. It usually happens at
 random times and stops a minute or two afterwards, causing my PC to greatly slow down during the process. My question is, how do I solve this?</p>
<p>It started happening randomly, not after anything was installed or Windows updated or anything of the sort.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />often enough system uses disk on behalf of other programs - this is a part of UAC technology, see <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/richard_macdonald/2007/05/18/windows-vista-file-and-registry-virtualisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/richard_mac...</a>
<br />So please look at the middle table of Disk tab of Resmon to look for what files are accessed - this may help to find an active process.

<p>Hey there Thrash!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this situation, in this instance, it might be that you have a balance keeping you from re-subscribing. If that is the case, then I would suggest following the instructions here on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/pay-past-due-balance-on-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to pay a past due balance on an Xbox subscription</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help resolve the issue, then I would suggest getting in contact with
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support
</a>and see if they can help you re-subscribe successfully. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading !</p>

            <p>If you are performing a clean installation booting from DVD.&nbsp; We usually come across this error message if the CD/DVD drive is incompatible with Microsoft's AHCI driver (msahci.sys).</p>
<p><br />
To work around this issue, disable AHCI mode for your disk controller in the system BIOS. Typically the controller has to be changed from AHCI mode to "IDE" or "ATA" mode.</p>
<p>Access the below link for more information:</p>

            You said the USB drive shows up as both a USB drive and a CD drive - if it's listed twice in the boot order try switching them, see #1 below.<br />
<br />
<span>For changing the BIOS settings - every computer is a little different for this process so I can't
 give exact directions. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>A required CD/DVD device driver is missing
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Change BIOS boot order - The most successful fix for this issue is to set the optical DVD drive (or USB drive) as the first boot device in the BIOS. To do this, first enter BIOS mode as
 follows: </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>This is accomplished by pressing a specific key repeatedly as soon as your computer is turned on (or right after it is restarted). For many computers, the key is &nbsp;F1, F2, F10, the Delete
 (del) key or the Escape (ESC) key. Consult your computer or motherboards manual or try different keys until you find the right one.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Find the screen or option for changing the boot order. Follow the instructions for changing the boot order.
</span><span>Every computer is a little different for this process as well so I can't give exact directions.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) ﻿Disconnect all internal
</span><span>hard drives you are not installing Windows on</span><span>. Also disconnect all external drives. Then reconnect after
 installing.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD, double check that you burned the .ISO file as a disk image (and not as a regular file) to the empty DVD. If you burn it to a DVD again
 use the lowest speed possible. It's also possible the download has errors, try downloading it again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4) Update ITE ATA driver - Failing the above, try booting back into Windows Vista or XP. Launch Windows Update and install the ITE ATA driver update before attempting the upgrade. The upgrade
 advisor may not find this driver. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>5) Switch from SATA to AHCI - Follow the aforementioned instructions for booting into your computers BIOS, then check your HDD or storage settings. Turn off SATA, switching to AHCI, and reboot
 normally, then re-attempt installation of Windows 7. Also try switching to IDE. </span>
<span>Every computer is a little different for this process as well so I can't give exact directions.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>6) If you have another DVD drive hook it up to your computer and try using that drive to install Windows 7, or try a different USB drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>7) Try installing Windows using a USB drive:</span></p>
<p>
<span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/how-to-install-windows-7-on-a-netbook-from-usb/ff8f440f-b956-4d82-8d8b-b42ff64115d9</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also, there's 2 main threads for this issue, one that seems to be related to retail disks (and others). They might not apply since you're using USB:

            My computer has NEVER been able to upgrade to 8.1. I gave up on that years ago. No one who I ever took it to was able to resolve the mystery problem, so I finally gave up after spending about $500 on tech support (both in person and remotely) trying to
 get it done. So I’m stuck with Windows 8.&nbsp;

<h2>            Cumulative Updates Failing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been failing to install updates KB3197954 and KB3200970. These are the October and November Cumulative Updates to Windows 10 Version 1607 X64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my last attempt to install, I did the following to ensure I could help you as much as possible:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Download the latest cumulative update from the online catalog KB3200970</li><li>Run Windows Disk Cleanup Utility including the System Files option selecting all the boxes</li><li>Run CCleaner just to be sure everything was cleaned</li><li>Reset Windows Update 3 different ways:
<ol>
<li>Built in troubleshooter</li><li>Third party script file</li><li>Manually with command prompt, manually backing up and deleting folders</li></ol>
</li><li>Run SFC System File Checker - No Errors</li><li>Run DISM Deployment Image Servicing and Management - No Errors</li><li>Turn off anti-virus</li><li>Run the update install file</li></ul>
<p>The update process then goes as follows, with both updates doing exactly the same thing:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>File Installs update and requests restart which I accept</li><li>As the computer shuts down, the message shows it is configuring updates, and counts up to 30%</li><li>Computer reboots</li><li>Message shows the installation continues counting up to and including 100%</li><li>Message changes to say the installation has failed and it is rolling back it's actions</li><li>Computer reboots</li><li>Same message appears then windows loads.</li></ul>
<p>After windows has loaded I re-enabled my anti-virus and collected all the information and logs I could think of, available in a zip file
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DSgUzvxRAiT0pTa3Rja3FSQ1E/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here on google drive.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction here.</p>

            <p>Answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Have you ever run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> and/or the <strong>
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What Build of Windows 10&nbsp;Version 1607 is currently installed? [tap the Windows key, type “winver” into the Start menu, and press Enter key]
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;CCleaner's Registry Cleaner component has&nbsp;EVER made to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

            Same problem here too. Both updates won't install. I just wanna punch those MicroCroft developers for wasting our time and giving us headache. This is the 3rd update that won't install. Even tech support won't be able to install it. Lots of users are having
 problem installing those two updates.

            <p>Unfortunately my Windows installation took a turn for the worse. Started up the machine this afternoon to find a whole host of DCOM errors and a start menu that refused to open.</p>
<p>The updates I could live without and work for a solution as they provided mostly under the hood fixes I probably didn't need, but I'd rather have a new fresh install given the worsening condition of my installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and help</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem with the KB3200970 "anniversary" update that has been going on for almost a month. &nbsp;The automatic update runs and fails nightly. &nbsp;My computer is an HP Envy DV6T-7300 laptop purchased in February 2013. &nbsp;HP says W10 is not supported
 on this computer (too old) &nbsp;but the computer was found compatible many months ago and updated from W8.1 to W10 successfully. &nbsp;The update and all W10 automatic updates after it have run normally until now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows online support techs tried 4 or 5 times to get the update to install under remote control so I don't know just what they did. &nbsp;They finally said that my computer was not compatible because there were no W10 drivers for it. &nbsp;(There are only W8.1 drivers
 from HP, but I suspect this is not really the cause.) &nbsp;McAfee was uninstalled but not with their Consumer Products Removal Tool. &nbsp;Defender is now running and current. &nbsp;There are current versions of Firefox and Thunderbird on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is minimal, something like failed to install. &nbsp;Watching an update shows (in about an hour) the update passes the 96% point but eventually fails. &nbsp; Windows then undoes the install (taking another hour or two) but runs normally after login.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a page about turning off specific updates, but have not tried it yet. &nbsp;I'll have to look at that again. &nbsp;I really want the latest version so am still looking for a way to get this to install. &nbsp;I'd like instructions to view an installation error
 log to see if a cause and fix can be found.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to wifi as it shows red cross mark</h2>
                    <p>Hi, ,</p>
<p>I've Sony Vaio, Windows 10&nbsp;and Wifi is showing red x, cannot connect&nbsp; the &nbsp;internet. I did&nbsp;every steps&nbsp;you recommended&nbsp;in the community forum and this the description of WLAN:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WLANSVC service provides the logic required to configure, discover, connect to and disconnect from a wireless local area network (WLAN) as defined by IEEE 802.11 standards. It also contains the logic to turn your computer into a software access point
 so that other devices or computers can connect to your computer wirelessly using a WLAN adapter that can support this. Stopping or disabling the WLANSVC service will make all WLAN adapters on your computer inaccessible from the Windows networking UI. It is
 strongly recommended that you have the WLANSVC service running if your computer has a WLAN adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is some screen shot below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
