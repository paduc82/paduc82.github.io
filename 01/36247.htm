<h2>            Executing Playlists in WMP 12 &#34;Play To&#34; DLNA Device &#40;Wireless&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a playlist of about 60 songs and 10 music videos which resides on my main home PC. The playlist executes OK in WMP12. On another floor, I have a DLNA box hooked into a home theater system.&nbsp; My laptop connects wirelessly to the main PC and I can access
 the digital music and video library and playlists I have stored there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use the WMP 12 application on the laptop to play songs and video (selecting a few and dragging and dropping into the Play tab); everything works OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for the use of the "Play To" function. Drag and drop a small group, or a few videos, and everything is cool. The problem comes in dragging and dropping my 60 song/10 video playlist.&nbsp; Dragging and dropping that doesn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>Is the Playlist actually composed of all the songs and videos on it, or does it merely control pointers to the individual elements in the digital media library? If it is the former, I could understand that my WiFi is not up to the task of streaming the content.&nbsp;
 However, if the situation is the latter,&nbsp; I don't understand why the playlist won't execute in the "Play To" function.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>: I would suggest you run the media player library troubleshooter and check if it helps:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>: I would also suggest you uninstall and reinstall the Windows Media player from

</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>2. Select the check box next to the Windows Media Player under

<h2>            Windows infinite loads on next boot, can only be fixed by going into Safe Mode and using DISM.exe</h2>
                    <p>I have an iBuyPower computer, it had one serious problem back in June/July 2017, it kept blue screening on startup, with the error "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED". It was fixed, and never happened again, but one day, my computer crashed while playing a game, but
 didn't blue screen. It made a weird sound in my headphones. After I restarted it, I noticed my computer wouldn't load. I looked up solutions on my phone. After I read about DISM, I forced Automatic Repair and went into safe mode using command prompt, using
 bcdedit /set {default} safeboot network. I ran the DISM.exe command (DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth). When I set safe mode to Off and restarted my computer, the problem was gone, but when I restarted again, it did the same thing AGAIN! So I
 had to do this process all over again. I've ran a virus scan. This has become a very annoying thing for me. I'm scared that my computer will just never boot.</p>

            Hi -([{ properson32 -}]),<br />
<br />
<br />
There are other troubleshooting methods that you can do to resolve your concern. Try checking for updates. Scan device performance and health. Update your drivers. Remove recently installed or unnecessary software. Remove external hardware and see if that resolves
 the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.

            Hi JackGoode 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Take actions related to Display Driver as the first level of troubleshooting
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />You will need to restart your computer after the above steps.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE BLACK SCREEN DURING UPGRADE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parikshit pokharel  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE BLACK SCREEN DURING UPGRADE</h2>
                    I'm upgrading from the insider version of windows. So after receiving the latest build I restarted my laptop. My windows 10 was ready for upgrade. Now there are 3 steps of upgrade, copying files, installing drivers and configuring settings. After thw first
 step my lapot restarted and then the upgrade resumed. However after the 2nd stage my laptop restarted and then all i can see is a black screen. Its not completely black as in when the laptop is tirned off but the screen is emitting light but ita black there's
 no cursor nothing. And its been like that for 3 hours now. This is my second attempt, in my first attempt after this problem i turned off my laptop pressing the power button. After starting again the upgrade seemed to resume but then at 83% it restarted and
 restored my previous version. I got errors in my windows update when i pressed install. So i performed a disk clean up, downloaded the latest build and started it all over and i seem to having the same problem.

            <p>I'm replying from Windows 10. Upgrade successful, this isn't necessarily a solution but it did work in my second attempt. I think this problem is due to the graphics driver compatibility, my driver is AMD Radeon HD&nbsp;5000 series. I would recommend downloading
 an iso file and performing a clean installation. </p>

<h3> marleynick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot run as administrator. UAC administrator disabled</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed my computer's account name by running netplwiz on windows 7. After the change was effected, I restarted my computer. I realised that the account had changed from admin account to a guest account. I went to User Accounts so as to change
 the account back to Admin. When I clicked on "change your account type", a UAC dialog box appeared prompting for the password and the "yes" option was greyed out. I tried running CMD as administrator but the UAC dialog box will not allow me.
<br />
<br />
My efforts to use the default Administrator account were futile. I rebooted the machine in safe mode and logged in using my account (which is still a guest account). I started cmd and typed the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I get a system 5 error access denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can just access administrator privileges? And change my account back to admin?</p>

            Hi Bradley, 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 does run a lot of background processes . . .
<br />
<br />From your screenshot, your processor, GPU, network and disc are just ticking over nicely . . 
<br />
<br />Your RAM usage does seem high
<br />
<br />Click on the Processes Tab in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click on the RAM column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of that window

            Hi Bradley.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Especially if this is a factory install, you'll greatly reduce the overhead by turning off the freeloaders at Startup in all 3 locations shown in Step 4.  This is the most important thing after a good quality Clean Install that you can do for performance.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Bradley,
<br />no need to worry, this is normal for Windows 10. In contrast of previous Windows versions it runs each service as a separate process and starts other processes for a seemless and unnoticeable work of many different functions.

<h2>            Taco bell reward help please</h2>
                    
<p>Hey i got this ticket from taco bell to enter a code to see if I get a reward.&nbsp; So the card says to use either my Xbox 360 dashboard or their website.&nbsp; I looked over my dashboard and each marketplace in my xbox and even used the bing
 to try to find anything taco bell related.&nbsp; Got some videos, songs, and a Kinect game advertisment but nothing about the taco bell landing for the halo stuff.&nbsp; So, I use the website to enter my code.&nbsp; It lost but then it says afterwards that if I entered it
 using the Taco Bell Landing on my Xbox 360, I would have got a Halo avatar item.&nbsp; Thing is, there IS no Taco Bell landing on my Xbox 360.&nbsp; I searched again for a long time and it just is not there.&nbsp; Did I just get screwed out of a reward item here due to bad/false
 advertising?&nbsp; I want that halo item because the landing is not on Xbox Live at all anymore as far as I can see.&nbsp; I am a Canadian in BC and I am qualified to win this, but I shouldn't be punished for being forced to use their website instead of the Xbox 360
 since the landing simply is not there at all.&nbsp; it is august 23rd and I do have a second ticket a friend gave me, but I can not use it for one more week.&nbsp; Can someone in rewards support help me out here and let me know if Taco Bell and Xbox just screwed me
 over on this item?&nbsp; I applied for the second chance thing and that is where it actually said that I was supposed to get a Halo avatar item if I used the Taco Bell landing, which does not seem to even exist anymore.&nbsp; Sorry for the big block of text but I want
 to get this figured out before September 2nd.</p>

<p>Hey there Kardrack! For 3rd party promotions, like those put on by Taco Bell, you'll need to enter the code on their website first. If you cannot find this, please check the FAQ and/or rules of the promotion. These should be available at Taco Bell stores,
 or from their website. Let us know if you find it, thanks! </p>

<p>No offense but I'm not sure you read my post or my post was confusing. &nbsp;Their website said that if I enter the code using their landing in the Xbox Live marketplace, that I would unlock a halo avatar item. &nbsp;Thing is, they don't HAVE a landing in the Xbox
 Live Marketplace. &nbsp;The Taco Bell website says if you use the website, you don't get the item. &nbsp;Only if you use the non-existant xbox live marketplace landing for them. &nbsp;As of September 2nd though, the promotion ends.</p>

<p>Hello Kardrack,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately as Mister Gwyther has said this is a Canadian promotion. I understand that it states that you should be able to redeem it via the landing page on the console but if it is not there then no one can simply make it appear. They might be having some
 problems with the specific promotion page, someone else on the forums also said something about this more than a month ago now and they were pointed to e-mail the promotional team running this.<br />
<br />
Please redeem the code on the website for now and inquire via e-mail to <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>.
<br />
<br />
That's unfortunately the only point of contact we would be able to give to you in regards to this promotion. It's quite possible the folks running the promotion might be able to just give you a redemption code for the avatar item.<br />
<br />

<p>The landing page is hard to find. You need to cycle through the tabs (home, tv, games, etc.) and look in the bottom right corner at the advertisements. The Taco Bell one is usually there (sometimes not, I restarted my system once to make it appear) and select
 it. There will be a few options. 1st one is to enter pin.</p>

<h2>            cannot print emails</h2>
                    I bought a Canon TR8520 printer today. I have it setup for wireless and can print from the internet but cannot print any emails. I called Canon support and they verified that the printer is connected and we printed a few items but we still could not print
 any emails. I was told to contact Microsoft support for help. Canon feels that the settings for the email need to be changed. Any suggestions ?

<p>Yes, I have been doing the procedure as the instructions are given. I have used Microsoft Mail for a couple of years but my Canon MX892 died over the weekend so I bought and installed a Canon TR8520 today. The procedure you suggested work prior to installing
 the new printer.</p>
<p>This afternoon I signed onto my old AT&amp;T account and pulled up my Yahoo email. This is how I used to view and print my emails. Going this route I was able to print off my emails.</p>
<p>Something is amiss with the Windows Mail that is not allowing me to print emails.</p>

            Well I’m thrilled you found a workaround... 
<br />
<br />But you’re right, there is something Windows Mail isn’t thrilled about with that print driver. 
<br />
<br />Do me a favor, click start, and type “control panel” - from there, devices and printers. Double click your printer, then click printer in the printer queue box, then properties. 
<br />
<br />If you click on the “advanced” tab - the exact printer driver should be there, can you tell me what it says? I wonder if I can find one around it that works, and that Windows Mail doesn’t hate...

            I followed your instructions, the printer driver is "Canon TR8500 series". Next to it is a separate box that says "new driver".

            Ok, let’s do the easiest thing first:
<br />
<br />Click “new driver” - click next,  and it should pop you to a pop where you can choose a manufacturer, and then a bunch of different models. Choose canon, and then look for your model on the right... are there any other models above or below that, that seem similar?

            No problem, next time windows has a version update (1809 presumably) - check Windows Mail again and see if it'll print. They are always looking to make improvements and fix issues with those builds. 
<br />
<br />Have yourself a great rest of your week, and please leave a positive review if possible!

<div><br />
<div>Sorry for not being clear enough. <b>On the Player tab under options, it says 'Customize updates and Player settings'.
</b>You MUST pick one of 3. I DO NOT WANT automatic updates. I do not want a music player to update anything. I have made changes to titles of mp3 files and the updating process apparently ignores "apply media information changes" and reverts back to orig.
 info. that causes me to get 'i' messages when trying to play a playlist I created. So if the playlist is 20 songs long, after the updating process it may only be 8 songs long. Also, This has happened so many times, I sought your assistance. If there is no
 solution, please advise anyway. I do not want all the **** information provided by internet updating.</div>
</blockquote>
<div><br />
1) You can't remove the autoplaylist <b>feature</b>, you can only add, modify or remove specific autoplaylists.
<div>2) That setting looks for media player updates. &nbsp;It does not affect or change any of your content (mp3's) or playlists.
<div><br />
<div>If you don't want playlists that autoupdate, then don't create autoplaylists... create regular playlists. &nbsp;They will only change if you manually change them.</div>

    <title>Video Playback issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camigrenier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Playback issues</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and this issue happens on the Edge browser and my other browser Google Chrome. You tube videos, the video ads that play on Microsoft games, and videos on windows opened within websites are zoomed in so close that you can't make out what
 is playing. This issue started about six weeks ago, so I took my computer back to a restore point to before that time and the issue seemed to be resolved for about two days, after which the issue started again.

<p>Hi Cami,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An outdated browsers or display driver is on of the possible causes of playback issues. To isolate your concern, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the current build of your computer? Press Windows key + R and then type winver.</li><li>Does the issue happen on web browsers only? Can you try to play a video file from your local storage to see if the same issue persists?</li><li>Did you try to clear the browsing history and resetting your web browsers?</li><li>Did you get a specific error message?</li><li>Do you have a Flash Player installed in your web browsers?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly run the Video Playback troubleshooter. Go to Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security&gt; Troubleshoot&gt; Video Playback&gt; Run the troubleshooter&gt; Restart your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: The automated troubleshooter will try to identify and then resolve the issues that it finds.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thanks for replying. The current build of my PC is OS Build 17134.285; This issue happens on my Chrome and Edge browsers and when ads are played on Microsoft game apps that I play; I cleared the browsing history on both of the above browsers; I've never
 received any error messages; and yes Flash player is installed on both of them.</p>

<p>I'm connected to the internet properly on my 360, but sometimes, it will show the Kingdoms and Lords boxart instead of the actual game art for the disc in the tray and many of my downloaded titles. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if they're Games on Demand titles, XBL
 Indie Games, or Demos -- their art can appear as Kingdoms and Lords.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. &nbsp;Sometimes half of the My Games lists will show Kingdoms and Lords, but there's no pattern to which games display properly and which don't.</p>
<p>I guess it's a network thing. &nbsp;Instead of pulling in the proper game art, or even showing the default generic image, it displays some phone game instead. &nbsp;It's messed up.</p>

<p>If your running multiple Xbox on same network please open up your ports in port triggering instead of forwarding. I think this may happen when the port is being registered to the other Xbox so the I've you are trying to display will not get the correct content

    <title>Why should I have to pay for a name change again after Xbox force - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> broadfoal687856  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why should I have to pay for a name change again after Xbox force changed it.</h2>
                    <p>I recently had my gamer tag changed because it was reported by a bunch of cry babies that got mad at me for beating them, but&nbsp;that's besides the point, why should I have to pay for an Xbox name change again if Xbox force changes it. Seems like a rip off to me, if Xbox changes my name I should be allowed to change it to something else rather than having to pay, also my name didn't even contain anything offensive, nothing racist and whatnot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. The name was <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, come on how is that offensive and not hilarious, I have gotten countless messages saying they loved the name.</p>

            <p>It doesn't necessarily have to be offensive, it just has to violate the code of conduct, which it does. The name change policy is per the code of conduct you agreed to.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>There are two ways of doing it, One is moving the xbox live account to a different Microsoft Account. This is only possible via a xbox 360 console via the steps mentioned here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>The other option is that you just change the email address, the Microsoft Account itself will stay the same. To do that see the steps on this link: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account</a></p>

    <title>BIOS changes with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gigishine  say:</h3>
<h2>            BIOS changes with Windows 7</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and every since then...my bios boot configuration changes.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp;1TB HD and an external&nbsp;Western Digital Book.&nbsp; The change will often change swap the WD Book to the 1st configuration.&nbsp; This does not work because
 it does not have the operating system on it.&nbsp; Once it changed the 1st boot to be the CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; The first time, I called Dell and they told me that Windows 7 changes it and to press the F2-setup key and go into the BIOS and there is a F9 Key to restore
 to defaults.&nbsp; I did that and F10 to save it.&nbsp; It worked great for a couple of days and then something changes it back after the computer is shut off overnight and I reboot the next day.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice is that when I go into the System Configuration under Tools in Windows 7 ...Under the "General" tab...the use "original boot&nbsp;configuration is checked.&nbsp; I don't know how that got checked off but it will not let me uncheck it.&nbsp; The other
 setting under this tab are "Load Selected Items" and Load System Services.&nbsp;Those are checked. &nbsp;The Load Startup Items shows blue but not checked.&nbsp; I don't know what that means.<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure this out.&nbsp; All the POST tests on the system pass.&nbsp; And it is a new system (less than 1 year old).&nbsp; It is a Dell XPS 435T.&nbsp; Dell did recommend that I update the BIOS with their file...and actually did that before upgrading to Windows 7.&nbsp;
 I have the newest updates on the system in total. <br />
<br />
Please help.....I think it is just this one thing.....<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Gigishine,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Operating System loads only after it detects Media on your computer either CD ROM or Hard disk.<br />
Windows 7 do not have access to change the boot priority.<br />
The original boot configuration is used to access the boot files that are required to boot the computer and has to be checked in the System Configuration utility so do not try uncheck that option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your BIOS requires to be updated to the latest version and firmware. I would recommend you to contact the BIOS manufacturer for additional assistance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Why do i get different file sizes when downloading the same skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobw111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do i get different file sizes when downloading the same skype recording&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first started using skype recorder i tried multiple times over a couple of weeks to download the videos and couldn't find them on my PC.&nbsp; Some apparently went into my downloads folder, some appear to have gone into my Videos folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Although I
 might have moved them there not knowing what they were.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've finally had a chance to pull all these various downloads together, and starting looking at the dates, lengths, and file sizes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed is the same files, downloaded on different dates, show different file sizes despite having the same length and "Date" of creation.&nbsp; (I had to activate three date fields in File Explorer&nbsp; to figure this out "Date Modified", "Date Created",
 and "Date" with "Date" being the most helpful.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files sizes for one of the files are:72,976KB, 375,098 KB, and 203,568KB despite all three copies of the same file showing 00:50:01 as the length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Skype changing compression on the downloads depending on how busy their servers are?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, and the files all show the same length, what else would explain the different file sizes if the files appear to contain the same content?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked a couple of the files and they don't appear to be chopped short.</p>

            Recordings are automatically saved and synced to the cloud.
<br />
<br />During video calls, all user video is recorded, as is content from shared screens. The latter feature could prove useful when collaborating with colleagues.
<br />
<br />When a call concludes, recorded content is made available in all users' chat timelines for 30 days. Participants can save the recording to local storage, including mobile devices where the clip will download as an MP4 file, or forward it to other Skype users. 
<br />
<br />Try signing out of Skype, restart, then sign in again to see if you are then able to download them.

<p>Thanks, but there is no version of Quicken that will run on 10 available in the UK and Quicken no longer offer support for the British market !</p>

            Intuit discontinued the UK version of Quicken in 2005, and they generally offer support for only three years.&nbsp; You've had nearly 12 years to find an alternate.&nbsp; Good luck. This is not a Microsoft question.<br />

            Honestly, I had no idea that Intuit discontinued support for Quicken in the U.K. Why would they do such a thing? Must be a good story behind it.

            I have a feeling that keeping track of different currencies (UK pounds and Euros) might have had something to do with it.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi<span> Dartcap,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Linksys wireless adapter wusb300n is not compatible with Windows 7. You may still try to get it work by running the drivers in
 compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>Programs</strong>, click <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's
 setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to ‘Add legacy hardware’ mode from the device manager. Follow the steps to add legacy hardware.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Click on Start.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>In the Start Search Bar type Device Manager, and hit Enter.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>In the Device Manager window select the Wireless Network Adapter.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Select Action button and go to ‘Add Legacy Hardware’.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Follow the steps on the screen and add the hardware, this is a workaround as the drivers are not available for the same.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.
