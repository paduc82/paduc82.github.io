<h2>            Power Pack Failure</h2>
                    
<p>Had to replace my power pack in Dec last year as it was making awful noises and just getting worse. New power pack has just started doing the same thing after only 10 months. I'm now having to buy another one (surely it should have lasted longer?) and the
 only complaints process is to write a letter to the legal department as they have no email contact system. Has anyone else had multiple power packs fail and is there anything I can do to prevent it?</p>

<p>A strange or awful noise doesn't quiet give me enough to go on. The power packs are not anything that special or unique beyond the plug to the 360 or the converter to give the correct power and amperage. Often with laptops, I have found that people may leave
 the "wall to pack" side partially plugged into the wall or (more often) the pack. Any slight bump, such as walking across the floor, can cause the connection to break and reconnect. This can happen multiple time within a single foot step. The flickering of
 power can cause power surges and such that may damage the pack. Like wise, if you have brownouts and black outs, the same can happen. Two things to make sure of, ensure the plug into the pack is tight as it can be and that the wall outlet is holding the plug
 snugly in the socket.</p>
<p>Granted, you are more than likely already enuring all of the above. Another suggestion that I am sure you have looked into is to put a surge protector between the wall and the power pack. Beyond that, there is little that would cause the failure except the
 power coming from the socket itself. You can test the power output from wall socket to ensure it is stable and of the correct voltage and amperage. &nbsp;If there is an issue with the wall plug, you need an electrician.... or another outlet in the house.</p>
<p>As far as reliability of the power packs, I have 4 360's in my home. All 4 I have owned for over 16 months and they all have their original power pack. The oldest of them I bought the day the 360 slim came out (due to a red ring on my original 360) and it
 is still on the original power pack. I have yet to find any issues with my power packs. None of them make any noise. I wish I would be more helpful. Sorry.</p>

            <p>Where did you get the power pack from and is it an official one? &nbsp;Xbox does not support 3rd party devices. &nbsp;Also, before purchasing a new one you should check to see if it's still within a warranty period.</p>

<p>It was an official one from the xbox support site. I tried online chatting to see if there was a warrenty on the previous replacement as it's less than 12 months old but they just said to complain to the legal department in writing and that they didn't have
 anyone I could contact who would know more.</p>
<p>It's like a whining noise that gets louder the longer it's on. It's the 2nd one to do the same thing (both times after moving house so maybe it's to do with the different supplies between them?) and the xbox itself seems fine. Did wonder if the &nbsp;fan in the
 power back was clogged up but the noise seems too electrical for that.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows 10 0xc004f014</h2>
                    So I bought Windows 10 Home since I couldn't get the free upgrade because my previous Windows 8.1 version was not activated, my friend had a disk I was able to download from so I could not use the key. The thing is when I try to activate Windows 10 with
 the key that I bought it gives me the error code&nbsp;0xc004f014. Also the version that I have installed tells me Windows 10 Pro when I have clearly bought the Home version. Please help? I did not pay $127.49 for nothing.

            <p>Download and reinstall Windows 8 Core:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do you do it?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft recently released a new Media Creation Tool&nbsp;which you&nbsp;directly download and create a .ISO file for Windows 8.1 with Update 1.
</p>
<p>Lets take a look at how that is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download the Media Creation Tool from the following link and save it to your Downloads folder:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click Media Creation Tool file to launch setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2753fc28-15fe-46a2-b923-0704683cee2f" /></p>
<p>Wait while setup begins</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71ed227c-9772-445f-9114-44a25c994fb3" /></p>
<p>The following window allows you to select the Language, edition (Core or Pro), Architecture (32 or 64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15e9a2fe-6d39-41dd-a0de-218542065911" /></p>
<p>The above example shows all of the selected options. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To determine if your system came preinstalled with Windows 8 Core or Pro, look at the bottom of your laptop or on the chassis of the machine for one of the stickers.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.arstechnica.net%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f12%2fwindows-8-stickers.jpg" /></p>

<p>Choose how you want to prepare your files. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install by creating media</strong></p>
<p>This I think is one of the most important steps, a lot of persons do not have fast Internet Connections, or they are using metered Internet Connections which prohibits them from downloading large files using their ISP over a period of time. Windows 8 is
 a 2 GB download which is still significantly large for some Internet Connections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB flash drive</strong></p>
<p>If you have a thumb drive with 3 GBs of available space, you can use that to create a bootable copy. Thumb drives are very cheap these days, so pick up a couple and create one as your first backup option. This is especially recommended for persons using
 Ultrabooks which do not include optical drives (DVD) or Netbooks. There are some desktop systems that do not include one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISO file</strong></p>
<p>An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 8, a blank DVD. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO and burn it using the built in Disc Image
 utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Creating a .ISO file</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. </p>

</p><p><strong>Retrieve your product key:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 8 setup did not retrieve your key and you had to use a generic key from the link provided, here is how to retrieve the product key from the BIOS.</p>

<h2>            How do I find &#34;All Programs&#34; on Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I have only just bought a Windows 8 laptop and am struggling with the difference between W8 and W7.&nbsp; When I right-click at Start the menu shows 'Programs and Features', but when I click I get only the uninstall a program option.&nbsp; I cannot open
 Canon Utilities (for my printer) because the control panel is not on my desktop as it is on my W7 laptop, and I cannot find the All Programs function.&nbsp; Canon is in my Apps screen but when I click it, although my printer is listed, there is no option to do
 anything.&nbsp; I'd appreciate any advice - thanks.</p>

            <p>I think you're mixing the All Programs from the Start menu with the Programs in the Control panel.</p>
<p>Actually, Windows 7 and 8 both have the same "Programs and Features" list (the uninstall list), it's just that Windows 8 is the first to give you a direct shortcut to get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me put it this way:&nbsp; Windows 8 still has the same "Start menu" organization, it's just larger (full-screen) now.&nbsp; Windows 7 would show your frequent programs first, then the full catalog under the "All Programs" arrow.&nbsp; Well in fact, Windows 8 does the
 same thing: just bigger icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to All Programs (7, left) or All Apps (8, right), you'll get the complete listing of all your programs that are installed. Windows 7 puts them in a small list, Windows 8 displays the list full-screen.</p>

            Files to be shared with other users on the computer should be put in the Public directory. That is what the Public directory is for. So copy your music to C:\Users\Public\Public Music and your daughter will be able to access the files when she's logged
 into her own account.

    <title>Windows 10 Cumulative Updates fail to install at 96&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alistairn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cumulative Updates fail to install at 96&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem for several months. Although unrelated, it first started around the time Meltdown/Spectre were discovered, which dates this problem to around January 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update has been trying to install a cumulative update, but the update (which changes KB number)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">fails to install during the restart</span> (at 96%, as the title suggests). It fails, begins rolling back the update, restarts, finishes rolling back the update, restarts, and boots into Windows where I'm promptly reminded
 to install the same update again. The whole process takes 10-15 minutes each time, and is inescapable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried <em>many, many</em> things, including (but not limited to):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Full system reinstall</strong>, several times</p>
<p>- Manually downloading and installing the cumulative update from the Microsoft website</p>
<p>- Suggestions listed in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/failed-install-2018-03-cumulative-update-for/140c7c68-8cd9-44fb-a9b7-bf3241846af5">
this thread</a> (in particular, the script suggested by Sumit the Microsoft MVP)</p>
<p>- Disable Fast Startup</p>
<p>- System File Check</p>
<p>- BIOS update</p>
<p>- Change graphics card</p>
<p>- Hiding the problem update - which only delays the problem until a new cumulative update is released the following month (and prevents me from installing any security updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is the following configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte Z68X-UD3R-B3 motherboard</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 2500K</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>128GB SSD system drive</p>
<p>2.5TB Storage Space (HDDs) data/application partition used exclusively by Windows</p>
<p>Dual-boot Arch Linux/Windows 10 Pro x64, GRUB bootloader (all on the same SSD listed above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, somebody help me get out of this fresh hell.</p>

            They way I see it is you have 2 choices.
<br />Disable updates until the next feature update which will be in about a week.
<br />To do this go to search and type services.msc
<br />Find windows update service set it to manual and turn it off.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />Do a fresh clean install of Windows without the internet.
<br />Once it is up and running then try the updates again.
<br />
<br />When CU updates don't install it is normally due to driver conflict.
<br />Microsoft is aware of all the users experiencing this issue and i like to believe that is why the Spring feature update is 2 weeks late.

<p>

            I hear what  you are saying.
<br />I have a machine that is only 4 years old and i have disabled updates and it is sitting at version 1703 for eternity.
<br />The issue is the feature updates are like a new release of Windows which can in turn cause PCs with unsupported drivers to not work.
<br />So vendors are scrambling to keep up with Windows releases and due to that disabling updates is the only solution until.  Frustrating at best.
<br />Sorry for all your issues and hard work.
<br />Crossing my fingers that spring update fixes it all for you.
<br />FYI - Make sure to run a backup before you attempt anymore updates

<p>I thought I'd return to say that I've fixed the issue (with the cumulative update failing at 96%).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did two key things that either could have solved the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I uninstalled Malwarebytes Pro</li><li>I marked my C: partition as Active in Disk Management.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I assume it only took one of these to fix it, and my hunch is that it was step 2, but freely admit either is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, for some reason (maybe because I'm using GRUB to boot my machine), my system partition wasn't marked as Active, despite the system running otherwise normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have an updated Windows 10 install, only missing the latest April 2018 feature update. That's next.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Assistant</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my Windows 10 laptop after months of inactivity, and was prompted to install updates.</p>
<p>Windows Update Assistant began download, but hung at 99% for hours.</p>
<p>I followed directions given at </p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027554/windows-windows-10-upgrade-assistant-is-stuck-at-99</p>
<p>through step 6, "<span>Follow the instructions to start the upgrade. On the <strong>
Get important updates</strong> screen, select <strong>Not right now</strong>, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>.</span>".</p>
<p>At that point, Windows Update Assistant gave status of "xx% verified", which climbed past 70% (I stopped watching).</p>
<p>The next screen said:</p>
<p>"Windows 10: Something went wrong.</p>
<p>Microsoft can't install important security updates on this computer.<br />
Please contact Microsoft Support for help with this error.</p>
<p>Please provide the support representative with this error code:</p>
<p>0x80070020"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the Microsoft Virtual Assistant for help; it said that error codes in that range mean that I don't have enough disk space. However, I have C: drive with 192 GB free and a D: drive with 21 GB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I'm trying the troubleshooter, as suggested at </p>

            Skip the virtual assistant. It is a very low grade "artificial intelligence", actually pretty dumb. Frankly, I'm surprised you were able to get anything useful from it. So far I haven't been that lucky.  
<br />
<br />Chances are that you have more than one error, so work through the whole trouble shooting process described below.  You should look in Update History to see if there are any other reported error codes.
<br />
<br />You do have another alternative. Rather than trying to beat windows into submission by fixing the errors it has created to prevent updates you could simply do a clean install of 1709, or wait a few more days and do a clean install of the newest major update 1803. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to this wiki and follow the steps outlined under "GENERAL UPDATE TROUBLE SHOOTING PROCESS"
<br />One of those steps is running the update troubleshooter, which is supposed to deal with your specific error code.

            Hello,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help. Regarding your issue,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Rohn007, thanks for your reply. I ran the troubleshooter; it said it found &amp; fixed several problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up doing a live chat with a Microsoft tech (free!). He did remote control, re-ran a Troubleshooter (it found and fixed the same problems!), then went to this page:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10<br />
and followed directions for "upgrade", which did an install of the version 1709 that you mentioned. It seemingly worked.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft surface pro 4 shattered screen</h2>
                    I bought a micrsoft surfacr pro 4 in September from Currys PC world. I’ve never dropped it or bashed it and its mever overheated or been too hot to touch. I use it for work mainly. Recently i had it sat on my desk while i watched a turorial on youtube.
 I heard a crackling sound and noticed that tiny cracks were appearing in the screen, within seconds the entire screen was shattered. Has anyone else had this issue? And does anyone know if Currys would replace it as its still under warranty?&nbsp;

<h2>            DLC wont work&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got the gold edition of RE5 and after I attempted to play the new mercenaries mode my xbox told me the disc could not be read... I deleted the dlc and redownloaded it and it still gave me the same error. I tried a different RE5 disc and it still
 said "the disc couldn't be read" when i get to the start menu on the game mode. I have an original xbox arcade btw. Anyone know how i can fix this issue?</p>

<p>On a side note, feel free to add me if you would like to play any of the other RE5 game modes!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to determine which Windows 10 update version &#40;RS1,RS2,etc&#41; from the registry&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for an official method to determine which Windows 10 major update version is running on the system via the registry. I have made it as far as getting registry entries under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion". I
 need to know which is best registry key entry to use (BuildLabEx, CurrentBuild, CurrentBuildNumber, Release Id, etc)? And then how they map to different Window 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I need to use the registry entries to distinguish between the following update versions:<br />
</p>
<p>Threshold 1<br />
Threshold 2<br />
Redstone 1<br />
Redstone 2<br />
Redstone 3<br />
Redstone 4<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there any documentation that is kept up to date of what these expected registry values will be for future releases?</p>

 and there were no error messages, yet after I closed it once it forced the settings on it. Initially I went to the executable and it did not show it was on, yet steam said it was on. A little while after I reinstalled windows because it kept forcing bad settings
 on all kinds of programs, which was a pain in the ____ since I had to reinstall all my programs and copy over all my stuff, which took forever, and it did the same thing. To clarify, I did check the executable and it did not show the fact that the settings
 are on, however steam does say it's on, which means that it's hiding the option from me to fix this issue, the same issues that vista had by thinking it knows what it's doing and just causing problems.</p>
<p>My question is this: are there any tools, hacked or official, that can remove these bad settings?</p>

<p>When deleting anything, it is not the Registry Key that gets deleted but the Value part, that's the bit with things like D:\Downloads\setup_x64.exe for example.&nbsp; You should backup the Registry Key (right-click on Key and Export) before making changes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this will help as I am not familiar with the game or program called Steam.&nbsp; This relates to imposed Compatibility View settings in Itunes, but maybe you can apply that solution to your problem?</p>
<p>"compatibility mode Itunes</p>
<p><br />
compatibility mode<br />

Hi guys <br />
I found a solution that worked for me perfectly. Thanks to Silvia_s mentioning that changing the file name made iTunes open properly, that led me to believe that the compatibility mode was still being stored within the registry for the itunes.exe file.<br />
To find where Windows7 was storing this information, since googling didn't help, I set compatibility mode to a file that would be easy to track as a test file in the registry (since itunes.exe will have you looking at entries forever!).<br />
Anyway, long story short, I found at this location in the registry:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers</p>
<p>At that entry I found two files mentioned, the one I just set as a test file and behold.... itunes.exe! I deleted the itunes.exe from the key, fired up iTunes and NO MORE COMPATIBILITY MODE ".</p>

            <p>Hey MereDuck24! As Mister Mascot told you in your last post, the owner of the account will need to contact support to gain access. If you are not the owner and can't provide the necessary information to support, they can't prove that you own the account regardless of what was purchased. Additionally, purchases can't be transferred so the games will need to be purchased again on an account you own. Purchasing accounts is a violation of the Terms of Service and code of conduct.

<h2>            skype version 7.46.0.596 video does not work on Android tablets</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a tablet Onda V10 Pro running Android 6.0 and downloaded Skype frm Google Playstore. I also have a Samsung tablet SM-T535 runnning Android 4.4.2 on which I the same version of Skype is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On both tablets, if I make a test call with video, the video blinks on for about 1/4 to 1/3 of a second, then off (for the same period of time, repeatedly. When the video goes off, the button to enable/disable the camera and the button for conference calls
 disappears, they both re-appear when the camera blinks back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I earlier tried to call a friend with Skype on the Onda tablet, she seemed to say that she never received any video from me, although her video did appear on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the problem is and how to solve it?</p>

<p>This does not help. Going to the link provided, I can download Skype for tablets and I get version 7.46.0.596 (the same as before) from Google playetore. Symptoms are the same - the camera blinks on and off. I tried Skype for mobile devices and got the same
 software release and the same problem with the camera blinking on and off. Both of these tries were with the Onda V10 Pro running Android Marshmallow 6.0 - just as listed in the requirements page. My first downlaod on this device was after July 1, so I'm not
 surprised I get the same release of the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've &nbsp;tried the Skype &nbsp;Beta (no camera at all) also with no success. Repeated uninstall/reinstall does not help.</p>

            In relation to the above - I found that Skype which had been working ok up until recently on Android version 4.4.2 on my Galaxy Note 2 couldn't connect to a network this month and I was told that Skype is no longer supporting users on Android 4.4.2 and
 if your using 4 or 5 year old Smart phones. You either upgrade to Android Marshmallow or go without Skype on your Smartphone.
<br />
Obviously I'm unhappy with this and have naturally complained that Android users with older Smartphones will no longer receive service from Skype. Particularly when MS is still supporting desktop and laptop users ( inc updates ) who prefer Windows 7.

            The reason why its not allowing you to set it up is because its a security measure. You need to first generate a app specific password then use that to set up the account in Mail:

            2 options:
<br />
<br />Continue to ignore it
<br />
<br />Resize your partitions to give the recovery drive a little more space. You don't actually need to add much space, 50-100MB would probably suffice.
<br />
<br />NOTE: BEFORE doing drastic disk maintenance like this it is a VERY good idea to do a full disk image copy backup of your C: drive.
<br />
<br />Here are links to a couple of articles on partition managment

<br />HOW TO MANAGE PARTITIONS WITH THE DISK MANAGEMENT TOOL, IN WINDOWS 7 &amp; 8

<br />I prefer to split my HD into at least 2 partitions. One for OS and Applications and the other for Data. 
<br />Both Windows 8 and Windows 7 come with a handy disk management utility that allows you to create, resize and delete hard disk partitions on the fly, without having to boot into a special disk utility or purchase additional software. In this tutorial, I’ll demonstrate how to use the Disk Management utility in order to manage your partitions. As you will be able to see from this tutorial, the tool is quite easy to use and you don’t really need third party software.

<h2>            Macromedia Projector</h2>
                    I am trying to look at a CD rom for one of my nursing text books. I am able to open the CD from my computer screen, but when I go to the audio glossary I get the message the the macromedia projector has stopped working. I have downloaded and installed
 the adobe flash player and that did not work.&nbsp; I have windows vista home premium service pack 2.

<p><span>Hi Saraaileen76,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Vista Answers Forums.<br />
<br />
Macromedia Projector is a utility from Adobe (formerly Macromedia) which bundles up a Flash visual presentation into a stand-alone EXE file, so you can display the images on a PC without the Flash Player installed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to completely uninstall Adobe and Java from the computer and then try installing it on the Vista machine.<br />
<span>Download the latest version of Java using this link
</span></span></span><a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>To download Adobe flash player, use this link
</span><span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/?promoid=BUIGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/?promoid=BUIGP</span></a></span></p>

    <title>How to turn off Continuity&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keiththewolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to turn off Continuity&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! So lately I've been having an issue ever since installing Windows 10 version 1709 with multiple icons in the notification area of the taskbar of AMD's Radeon Settings After doing some research, I found out that this is an issue many people are having
 and that the likely candidate for this was the new feature called Continuity: &nbsp;<a href="https://community.amd.com/thread/221556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.amd.com/thread/221556</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a quick check, I noticed that it was not just Radeon Settings that was running multiple instances on my computer, but also many other applications as well...including the whopping 14 open instances of Runtime Broker!</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/568cdeeb-2d14-4e02-b734-08c6098a9d24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/568cdeeb-2d14-4e02-b734-08c6098a9d24" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's not just an AMD issue, it's an issue with the newest version of Windows 10. The feature is supposed to allow the programs to be restored after the computer restarts. While I can understand that it's supposed to make things load quicker (I'm guessing),
 I have an SSD so boot times aren't much of a concern to me. What is a concern is that there are multiple instances of the same program running and taking up resources! And even more, when I restart my computer, I want a "fresh" process of the program to be
 running, not an older one (in case a program is misbehaving. Remember the Law of the IT Crowd: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also figure that this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>may </em></span>be behind an odd issue I was having with my Start Menu. When I'd boot my computer up and log in, neither my Start Menu would come up from clicking the button or the Windows
 key on the keyboard. Cortana and the search bar also were non-functional. But...if I logged in as another user first, or logged in, then out, then back into my account, everything would be working as it should. When shutting the computer down after booting
 it up (because reasons!), I would get messages asking me if I was sure because the user had programs running and doing so could make them lose their work, which I found odd since
<strong><em>no </em></strong>programs should be running before I logged in. Luckily I was recently able to fix this issue by going into Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Sign-Options and toggling "Use my sign-in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update
 or restart." to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Off</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ultimately my question is how to turn this "feature" off since so far it's causing me more pain then convenience. I hope that others will also find this helpful in solving similar issues and I also hope Microsoft helps me turn this Continuity thing off!</p>

<h2>            H&#38;R Block</h2>
                    I recently filed my taxes on H&amp;R Block's tax program. I saved my taxes to a file. I have tried to reopen the file &nbsp;to do another return&nbsp;with no luck. I go to start. type in h, click on files, the name of the file is there but when I click on it I get a
 white screen. I can go to my documents library and click on the file. I get view downloads. when I click on this I get a file duplicated. I open with internet explorer. should I use something else? when I click on the H&amp;R block folder I get sent back to view
 downloads and back to open. My ends meet. What am I missing trying to open this file? I've got a bald spot from pulling my hair out.

            Ask H&amp;R Block support about this. It sounds like you did the taxes online instead of actually installing the tax program on your computer. See if they have a way to save your file to a pdf file so you can open it. Turbo tax has this capability. Go to the
 tax site and open your account to see.
<div><br />
<div>To file another tax return you have to create another account if you use online filing. You can't open your tax return to do another one.&nbsp;</div>
