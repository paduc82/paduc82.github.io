<h2>            video chat recording</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I'm trying to record video chat with my teacher. But recorder app&nbsp;says I can't use microphone for it at the same time of conversation. Many apps says that I can record any conversation live, but no one works for me. What can be done about
 this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Marina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Skype does not have built-in recorder, if you want to recover your audio or video calls you must use a third party application. For more information, please visit this FAQ article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12395/how-can-i-record-my-skype-calls?q=recorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How can I record my Skype calls?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the recording app does not work with your microphone, if that is the case, I highly suggest to contact the support site of the recording application that you're using for further assistance, as this is outside of the Skype's scope
 of support. Or, try using a different recording application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
<p>

Did you upgrade on that machine? Are you sure there weren't any problems with Bluetooth and Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter? Does WIN&nbsp;10 support that devices out of the box/via WU? Give me some details, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I did upgrade last week - all works very good, PC boots faster and runs better than on Windows 7. Regarding problems with drivers, all was installed by Windows (audio, wifi, graphic card) expect of bluetooth. Problem with BT was due to the fact that bt
 module was somehow disabled during upgrade and it was not possible to turn it on via Fn+F2. Fix for that:
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=N775F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=N775F</a><br />
<br />
Download, run as admin in compatiblity mode and BT module will be enabled and installed.</p>
<p><br />
Summary: N5010 seems to be fully compatibile with Windows 10, no problems observed so far (only small issue with BT).</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Dear Friends,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have upgraded my Inspiron N5010 AMD HD5470 device today with no issues at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>here some tips:</strong></p>
<p><strong>After download complete just disconnect from internet. Else you will stuck in "preparing for install".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allow it a handsome amount of time to complete upgrade process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>then after upgrading you may face problem with your AMD graphics adapter(Display Adapter)!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Don't worry :)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Just Right click on My Computer And open Manage And click on device manager and
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;then click on Display Adapters</strong></p>
<p><strong>you will see Microsoft basic Display Adapter</strong></p>
<p><strong>rightclick on it and update driver software</strong></p>
<p><strong>select browse from pc and </strong></p>
<p><strong>select the folder where you have copied the dell drivers(Choose the ATI driver folder
</strong>R272410 )</p>
<p><strong>Then next.&nbsp; Enjoy !!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alternative:&nbsp; You can download a HD5400 Series windows 10 32/64bit supported driver from internet.</strong></p>

            Hi RSimp80 
<br />
<br />That driver is available on the Microsoft catalog page:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=%2024.21.13.9924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />However, it may be better to update form the Nvidia website - open Device Manager, expand the Display Adapters section, what Nvidia card is listed there?

            Hi RS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    Initially, I was experiencing an extremely slow response with Vista Ultimate. At times the system locks up for a couple of minutes. Ths disk activity light was on solid.<br />

After looking at the activity in PERFMON, I have disabled the&nbsp;Indexing Service and the SuperFetch service. The system runs much better now.&nbsp; I would like to use these services again, but that's a subject for another question.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Run Checkdisk then&nbsp;running SFC /scannow again and see if you actually get the same error.<br />

<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
If you can remove SP2 to go back to SP1 - or SP1 to go back to standard Vista. You can go forward<br />
back to the SP you were at once it is fixed.<br />
<br />
Try a InPlace Upgrade.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD (same 32/64 bit) as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />

<br />
No changes have been made to my computer. Complete error message is:<br />
<br />
"The program can't start because d3drm.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this. d3drm.dll is not compatible with this version of Windows (Windows 7)."<br />
<br />
Yes, it worked when I had Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Your methods are a mute point since the game cannot load unless I can run d3drm.dll on my computer. Method 1 is therefore a mute issue. Same goes for Method 2 since d3drm.dll is missing from my computer. Method 2 is therefore a mute issue.<br />
<br />
Your methods do not address the issue at hand. The issue is that d3ddrm.dll is missing from my computer #1, and d3drm.dll is not compatible with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Microsoft should allow d3drm.dll to run on any version of Windows for older games. It makes no sense whatsoever not to have this file available for any Microsoft OS.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;A very true statement, yet microsoft still doesn't feel the need to fix the problem. &nbsp;When I contemplate the reasons a primary software provider won't fix a nagging problem like this, I keep coming back to the money issue - no profit, or not enough profit

 trust applied, however any attempts to validate this trust or build it from the wizard ends with that Domain 2 can not locate the Domain Controller for Domain1. &nbsp;What can be done to allow Domain2 to validate this trust?

            <p>Hi Henry - thanks for the update...the settings you use for ripping your tracks do have some bearing on what information (metadata) will be added in the library. Wav. files are the highest quality (comparable to CD) but cannot quite be as readily edited
<p>Check your rip settings under 'Organize' - 'Options' - 'Rip Music' tab in WMP The
<em>snip below </em>shows what you need to be looking at - top highlight, where your music will be ripped to...then the format (I prefer to use mp3 because of its wide compatibility, but it's personal choice). Make sure the copy-protect box is unchecked (it

<h2>            What happens to the child account after the parent leaves family&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was wondering what happens to the child account after the&nbsp;parent account leaves the family? Does the child get turned into the&nbsp;parent or does the child's account get deleted?</p>
<p>I've been wanting to get rid of the&nbsp;parent account which is linked to mine for a while now,&nbsp;since I'm no longer a child. I believe that it was a mistake to set up the accounts like this since&nbsp;my account is still considered a&nbsp;"child account."&nbsp;Is there maybe
 a way to change my account from being a child account to a parent&nbsp;or if the&nbsp;parent account leaves the family, will my account then be considered&nbsp;to be a parent&nbsp;account?</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our features, Family, makes it faster than ever to add and remove family members to each Windows 10 PC you sign in to with your Microsoft account. Since you've mentioned that your account was set up as a child account then you can remove<br />
<br />
If you need to remove someone from your Microsoft family, it's important that you first turn off all family settings for anyone labeled as a Child, or some settings may still apply. You can be an adult, but still be in the Child role, so it's best to double-check
 on your family roster page. It will indicate your role under each family member's name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To remove someone, go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.microsoft.com/family</a> and sign in with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>2. To remove a child, find their name, select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>
Remove from family</strong>.</p>
<p>3. For adults, select <strong>Remove from family</strong> under the name of the person youre trying to remove.</p>
<p>4. If youre the only adult in the family and wish to leave, youll need to remove all kids first, then find your name and select
<strong>Leave family</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue - is it because of the last update to Windows 8.1? It was working fine prior to that and I have restarted, shut down, closed all apps and refreshed the tablet and it is still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The front facing camera is working but the rear facing camera keeps coming up with the error message that it is being used by another app and please close the other app. But no other app is open so I don't know why it is not working.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Original title:Windows live mail problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past two weeks I have been receiving Windows Live Mail only sporadically. Some days I receive no mail. other days only one or two vs. when I check Outlook.com, I have dozens of&nbsp;emails every day.&nbsp; I also just sent a test email to myself from Live
 Mail and it has not arrived in my in-box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 10 days ago, I&nbsp;received an email that appeared to be from Microsoft indicating that my email had been accessed by someone in Russia and I asked to change my password, which I did.&nbsp; Since then the problem with receiving email seemed to have gotten worse.&nbsp;
 Can you please help resolve this problem?&nbsp; I much prefer Live Mail and accessing it from my desktop icon than using&nbsp;Outlook on the Internet.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm yet again having difficulty receiving email at my Windows Live Mail account.&nbsp; I had taken the steps you recommended in September and was receiving email just fine, but now have not received any email since Dec. 1. I have followed the steps&nbsp;in adding
 an account three times now and still nothing is being received. Since yesterday when I added my three msn accounts, mail dated up to Dec. 1 has been received into my default account, but for the other two accounts there is no email in them and it says&nbsp;"Windows
 Live Mail is synchronizing this account. Check back in a few minutes to read your messages."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help in getting this resolved.&nbsp;I prefer Live Mail to Outlook because Outlook doesn't have a read receipt feature and it doesn't allow you to scroll through your entire inbox without having to click from one screen to another. Thanks
 very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am again having a problem with receiving Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I have not received any email since early&nbsp;December and I have tried adding and removing my accounts several times without any luck.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to continue using Windows Live Mail because it allows me to scroll through my entire inbox, which has quite a lot of email and I also&nbsp;have a more complete editing taskbar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you please tell me how I can get this problem fixed?&nbsp; Thanks very much. <br />

            <p>This is the third time I'm writing to get help with fixing the error that is preventing me from receiving or sending email from my Windows Live Mail account and no one has answered. I reported the same problem in Sept. and following the steps to add accounts
 and it worked for a while.&nbsp; Now, I've repeated those same steps&nbsp;without any luck.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how to fix this problem?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is Windows Live Mail still a viable product or does Microsoft want users to move to Outlook.com? The problem with Outlook.com is that it does not allow&nbsp;me to open it without opening my browser, scroll through my entire inbox and doesn't have a complete editing
 toolbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;that's why I'd like to fix Live Mail and continue using it.</p>

            Yes, I can access my accounts via a browser.&nbsp; I even uninstalled Windows Live Mail and reinstalled it, but no new mail&nbsp;has been received and outgoing messages are still in the outbox.&nbsp;

<h2>            Trying to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>(I would really prefer <em>not </em>to use Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to download the 7-to-8 upgrade assistant, it said that the page I was redirected to no longer existed. After that I tried downloading the 8.1 upgrade assistant. All went well until it got to the "We're going online to get somethings for you"
 step. <br />
<br />
It failed to get whatever it was getting and told me that I had to check my internet connection. Tried this 3 times with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, my internet connection is fine. Otherwise I wouldn't be posting on here.

            <p>Hi Favorite,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>To reinstall the Windows 10 Operating System, we suggest you to use an installation media&nbsp;</span><span>(USB flash drive or DVD</span><span>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's <span>how to download and run the media creation tool:</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft software download website</a>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for
 info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you can:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced options</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>System Restore</strong>. This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might be causing your PC problems.
 Restoring from a restore point wont affect your personal files.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Reset this PC</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to reinstall Windows&nbsp;10. This will remove apps and drivers you installed and changes you made to settings, but lets you choose to keep or remove your personal files.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>How do I unblock Pause Updates in the Group Policy Editor of Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claudiug  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unblock Pause Updates in the Group Policy Editor of Win 10 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my home PC with Win 10 Pro to version 1809 build 17763.475 a few weeks ago. I had already set via Group Policy to defer this kind of big updates for 180 days, to not reboot, ask before download etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problems started after this delayed update, somehow the Pause Feature and Quality Updates feature is enabled from Group Policy. I cannot find where and I also cannot download Defender definitions. The Windows Update window says "Some settings are managed
 by your organization". When clicking on "View configured policies", it says that the pauses &amp; deferrals are of type Group Policy and source Administrator. But I cannot find any gpedit settings like that. And "Advanced Options" has the paused features greyed
 out because of the supposed Group Policies. And says that "Quality updates paused by your organization until 6/16/2019." Same for Feature updates. But my real problem is no more Defender definition updates!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\PolicyState and disabled the paused updates and set the period to end on May 16 instead of June 16 and rebooted. Still nothing, I have a Defender definitions update stuck
 saying "Pending download" KB2267602 (Definition 1.293.1848.0). And that it's ready to download, but it's not downloading anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where do I find the Pause Updates and Start/End Time in group policy editor to take them out? I went to Computer Config&nbsp; / Adm Templates ... / Windows Update for Business and no start date is there and the delay is now set to 0. Previously it was "Not
 Configured"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I cleared all gpedit policies in admin cmd prompt like below and got everything back to normal. Somehow my Pro edition got Enterprise settings on upgrade (pause updates for period X), those ones apparently don't exist to be configured in the Pro edition.

    <title>distorted sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordyg  say:</h3>
<h2>            distorted sound</h2>
                    Whenever any sound is played on my computer (including music and system sounds) it is constantly very distorted and jumps, skips, crackles. The sound used to work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens playing all sound input ie Cds, itunes, media player, I Player&nbsp;etc&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I have:<br />
&nbsp;- checked it isn't related to the volume<br />
&nbsp;- updated the drivers<br />
disabled enhancements&nbsp;to sound output<br />
&nbsp;- checked everything is connected properly and switched cables without any effect<br />
&nbsp;In addition, Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting didn't find any problems.<br />
I am running a Dell inspiron 530 running Vista <br />
Any suggestions on what might be wrong/how to fix this?

            Did you check in Device Manager to be sure that driver is the one installed? Sometimes you have to run them<br />
more than once as they rollback. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound - double click - Driver Tab<br />
<br />
You could also try this to refresh the driver stack - Right Click - UNINSTALL - then check the box to remove<br />
the driver - Reboot. <br />
<br />
Go to your downloaded driver - RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - REBOOT&nbsp;- check the right driver version<br />
shows up on the Driver's Tab.<br />
<br />
Recheck this <br />
<br />
Right Click Speaker Icon - Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all Sound Effect<br />
Apply -&nbsp;APPLY /&nbsp;OK<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
then try this :<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

You can paste the error sections in here (might be same section repeated so only 1 instance of each<br />
error section which is usually 10 lines or so).<br />

<h2>            Enforcement Action</h2>
                    I just received a notification stating '<strong>This message is to notify you that your Xbox Live account has been subject to enforcement action due to a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement'
</strong>I spoke with my son and he says that's because he reported on somebody's behavior. I entered the microsoft site (enforcement.xbox.com) but could not get any info. I would appreciate if somebody directs me to a place where I can find out what happened.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can hear myself talk via mic monitoring, but others can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t hear me</h2>
                    
<p>Using the new controller with 3.5mm plug, and a Turtle Beach "Marvel Super Heroes" headset plugged straight into the the controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can hear my own voice via mic monitoring, it doesn't seem to be a hardware issue. In party chat, the circle doesn't enlarge to show that I am talking, and no one can hear me either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing is, it was just working yesterday. It also works with my other controller for some reason. I may have updated the first controller, which may have messed it up. Not updating the 2nd controller for now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Video decoder for Windows Media Player in Windows 10</h2>
                    I am looking for a video decoder that will work with Windows Media Player in Windows 10. I have Power DVD 10 and VLC installed on my computer, but they both do not seem to be compatible with the Windows 10 version of WMP. Can someone please make some suggestions?
