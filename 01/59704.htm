<h2>            What is USER_ESRV_SVC_WILLAMETTE in Windows 7&#63; Could it cause a box to appear&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I suddenly stated getting a black or white screen in the left hand side of my computer that's only there for a second. I've ran, Mal-Ware Bytes, downloaded and ran Spy-bot and ran a scan with my McAfee. I removed the Spy-bot because I know too many of those
 things can cause problems. Spy-bot removed some things, but nothing that it said was dangerous to my computer. Mal-Ware Bytes found an unwanted PUP file in the registry and removed it. McAfee found nothing. I went to the recent Applications and Events. I found
 this in there twice and I've never heard of it. I've checked Task Manager for background programs, but found nothing. Yet when I log off, after I've closed everything. I'm suddenly getting a message saying waiting for background programs to close. It takes
 longer to log-off than usual. (That screen popped up for just a second while I was typing this. It was gray this time.) Does that program have anything to do with this windows? If so, how do I remove it? If that's not the reason, can anyone help with this
 windows that keep popping up?</p>
<p>Thanks go very much.</p>

<p>Saturday night after I sent this post, when I tried to shut down the computer, I kept getting a message with something like "error in accessing file and there were some numbers after that" I found two such messages - one on top of the other. The computer
 would not&nbsp;shut down. I clicked force shutdown and got that message that unsaved things might be lost. I'd saved everything I'd done so I did a force shutdown. As soon as I turned the computer on last night, I ran Malware Bytes. It came out clean. I ran Disk
 Cleanup. Since I kept getting the "closing background programs message" I did some more checking on that. Task Master said nothing was running, but I used the "toolbox" to see if I could learn anything. It said I had several programs running at startup. I
 didn't know they were. There must have been at least twenty, including things like YouTube. &nbsp;I left the ones I knew were necessary, and deleted the others. The was one that just said default and when I fight clicked it all that showed up was "unknown". I deleted
 that. After that I was brave enough to open my email and say your message. Since I'd done the disk cleanup, I checked my PC drivers and I do have automatic update turned on there. I ran the system file checker and it said there were no unwanted programs on
 the machine. (not those words but similar)</p>
<p>I need to write down all my steps because I can't find Applications and Recent Events again so I don't know if I got rid of this program or not. After running the disk clean-up and getting rid of all those unnecessary programs that were running at startup,
 my computer shut down with no hesitation last night. I wasn't on it long last night and haven only been on it long enough to perform these steps but no boxes, so far. I guess I'll know if I use it all day. Can you tell this person who needs "Google" in her
 brain, when I found Applications and Recent Events so I can see if that program is gone?&nbsp; Thank you for your help.</p>

            Hi Robyn, you only need the Home version of Windows 10
<br />
<br />The switching out of S Mode is free and automatic and should automatically pick the appropriate Edition for your system
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an "Upgrade your edition of Windows" section, be careful not to click the "Go to the Store" link that appears there.)
<br />
<br />On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.

<p>Kiran,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply. I should have included in the post that Windows update reported no updates to load (last few days only Defender updates have been loaded).</p>
<p>Also, I've run power troubleshooter numerous times and other than once finding that the screen was too bright it found nothing. Absolutely nothing related to PCI-Express and compatibility.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no option under the advanced in troubleshooter, only one for apply updates immediately (see graphic).</p>
<p>Lastly, I didn't see anything in the recommended article that addressed my issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please advise, Thank you.</p>

<h2>            mouse and keyboard not working on acer aspire 5942G</h2>
                    The other day my laptop starting messing me around, (started taking a while to load up pages etc, i thought it might be a problem reguarding spyware, or a virus, i ran all my checks my laptop was fine, until i ran my AVG scan for antivirus, just after
 it had finished at 0 threats were found, my laptop suddenly rebooted on its own accord.. i felt the back and it was pritty hot, i left it to cool down over night, they next day i turned it on, and the trackpad or the keyboard wasnt working, i can log in using
 the fingerprint scanner, but once logged in i cant do anything, i plugged in 2 usb mouses into 3 seperate ports, none of them worked, ive tried performing a Start up repair and a system restore, using the avanced boot options,&nbsp; i havent tried anything in the
 command prompt yet, i was wonder if anyone knew the solution to this?<br />
<br />
here are the specs of my pc:<br />
Intel core i7-740QM (1.73GHz, 6MB L3 cache)<br />
ATI mobility Radeon HD 5650 (2783 hypermemory)<br />
15.6 HD LED LCD<br />
4GB DDR3 Memory<br />
640 GB HDD<br />
DVD-super multi DL drive<br />
Acer Nplify 802.11b/g/n<br />
6-cell li-ion battery<br />
and im running on windows 7<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened when you did System Restore?</span></p>
<p><span>You can follow the methods below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you perform System Restore through Safe mode and see if it helps.</span></p>
<span>Step 1</span>
<span>Start your computer in safe mode</span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></p>
<span>Step 2</span>
<span>System Restore
</span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, you can unintall AVG in safe mode and see if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE: Re-install AVG or any other security software back on your computer to protect your computer from virus.</b></p>

<h2>            Computer fails to load the login screen</h2>
                    <p>When I awakened my PC from sleep, my PC did not actually load to the login screen, so I pressed and held the power button and restarted. I proceeded to log in, and I was taken to a black screen with just my cursor. After a while, my start screen loaded,
 so I checked the minidump, and found this https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=89C3BC13C8CC6149!704&amp;authkey=!AAuNQ-hIqKVLBGg&amp;ithint=folder%2cdmp. I have no idea how to read these files, so please help if you can. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple notes:</p>
<p>-Some windows update installed earlier today</p>
<p>-I am pretty sure that I am virus free</p>
<p>-I installed an adobe flash update earlier today</p>
<p>-I didn't install anything else today or this week</p>

            I went to check my pc just now, and it did not wake up from sleep. I had to hold the power button to restart, so there must be something else causing the issue. I checked and there is no new crash log, so I am a bit troubled over this.<br />

    <title>Classic Games Are Gone On Windows 10........ - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wishboy14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Classic Games Are Gone On Windows 10........</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded Window 10, and while I really like this new OS, the first thing I noticed is that the classic Windows games are gone.&nbsp; WHOA - this isn't good.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read some of the replies listed concerning Windows 8; but, getting the Apps off of the Windows Store just aren't the same game.&nbsp; Not to mention, if you download these games (solitaire, spider solitaire, mahjong, hearts are my favorites) from the Windows
 Store you not only get a totally different game, but they come with advertisements !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would like to continue using Windows 10, but I would like my "CLASSIC" Windows games back.&nbsp; They've been on Windows OS's since Windows 95.&nbsp; How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think Microsoft needs to consider issuing an update that puts these back on our systems........</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP</p>

</p><p>I looked into the Microsoft Solitaire Collection, and <em><strong>from what I can see</strong></em>, the games do not look the same - and - you have to purchase this collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to access - if possible - is the "classic" Microsoft Games that were included, for free, in the Operating Systems (OS) Windows 95 to Windows 7.</p>

            <p>No, these versions that you can add from Windows Store are not the same.&nbsp; They look different (almost animated and cartoonish), have ads that pop up on the game, and, in the case of Solitaire, there is no option to play "Vegas" Solitaire - it's just straight
 up Solitaire.</p>

<h2>            Lego Pirates of the Caribbean</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry, there's no forum for the game, so I have to ask this here.</p>

<p>How do I defeat the fake Jack in the first 'Stranger Tides' level?</p>
<p>I've only been able to take one heart off the enemy, but every single attack I make after that is blocked. I've been working on this for over half an hour and I can't figure it out. I've looked up walkthroughs online and they don't say how to do it.</p>
<p>I am stumped, and very pissed off. I hate when I can't figure out crud in a game.</p>

<p>Start the sword-fight with the fake-Jack until she loses a heart and escapes into the next room.Bash the barricades that her goons put in front of the door and enter the next room, fighting she-Jack once again to deplete another heart. She will jump to the
 upper banisters, so go jump on the overturned barrel and roll it onto the orange switch on the right side of the room, then ride the elevator on the left.Jump over to the third narrow plank and continue your attack until Jack's imposter jumps down to the floor
 below and begins circling the room on top of a rolling barrel. Jump back down and start hopping up and down on the large bellows in the middle of the room. Stoking the fire will cause a bunch of fiery coals to spill out on the floor, knocking not-Jack back
 onto the floor. Clash with her once more until her heart is no longer in the fight.</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The availability of the game on a certain platform will depend on the game developer. Currently, the game Fornite Battle Royale is not yet available on Xbox 360.&nbsp; If you wish to have the game on Xbox 360, I recommend that you contact the game developer and
 ask or request the availability of the game on Xbox 360. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also submit a vote to have an Xbox 360 version of the game through our Xbox Uservoice Forums. To do this, you may click the link below:</p>

            Hi ndoug1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />If you mean video calls, then Skype to Skype video calls are free. Skype to landline/mobile calls will fall under $2.99 Skype plan.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />Skype to Skype calls are free, both the video and audio calls . . .

<br />You only need a subscription if you intend to call landlines or non Skype enabled mobile phones . . .

<h2>            Will Windows 10 have the Major Updates until 2018 or 2025</h2>
                    <p>I hope that in the Future that if Microsoft Has Ended Support for all Windows Products after 10 years then will Microsoft do the Support Lifecycle of Windows 10 (WAAS) for 10 years between 2015-2025, if in the future that after Microsoft has made a new OS
 to replace Windows 10, then will I have to think that All Future Games be for any computer OS like (Mac OS or Linux). Windows 10 is releasing 2 major updates this year (1703 &amp; RS3) and after the next major update (RS4 last Redstone codename of Windows 10)
 in 2018, will major updates stop after 2018 before mainstream support for all Windows 10 Edition Ends in 2020 and whenever extended support for Windows 10 ends in 2025, then Windows 10 (serviced by WAAS) will be the end of life in the next decade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mainstream support will end for Windows 10 Mobile in Early 2018?</p>

            According to Microsoft, Windows 10 is the last version of Windows, so it's going to be supported until the end of time.

    <title>Super slow internet over wifi connection - issue unknown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> young3142  say:</h3>
<h2>            Super slow internet over wifi connection - issue unknown</h2>
                    My HP Stream 13 has Windows 10 and has a super slow internet over wifi connections. 0.15 Mbps download speed / 0.38 upload speed. My wife's Lenovo laptop gets 39.42 Mbps download speed and 10.25 upload speed from the same location on the same wifi connection.
 I can confirm this is not an antivirus issue. It is not a malware issue either. I've reset the entire computer and the speed doesn't change. I've confirmed my wireless adapter's driver is up to date and accurate. I've made sure that there are no issues with
 the power management settings. Nothing has worked. Any suggestions?

            Idk if you ever found a solution, but I was having the same problem with my HP Stream 11 recently. It occurred after I got a new wireless router, and every other computer ran fine. I noticed that my connection said that it was public for whatever reason,
 and I switched it to private which helped my connection (unfortunately not speed, but better than what it was).

<h2>            Nothing showing on my screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need an advise on what to do. So I have&nbsp; Windows 7 installed on my system. I shutdown regularly but last Friday, I hibernated my system before leaving the office cos I planned working at home over the weekend. I ended up not working. Today I turned
 on the system, the lights are on but the screen is dark, completely blank. No light on the screen and nothing is showing on it. These are the things I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I took off the RAM and tested it on another system, it works fine</p>
<p>2. I slaved the hard disk on another system, it's asking me to format it. When I clicked cancel, nothing happens. I can't view anything on it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this happened to someone here? If it has, can you please provide a solution? I haven't achieved anything today</p>

            If you took the hard disk to another system and it says your only option is to format it, then the drive has likely reached the end of its life and it's time to replace.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I use my product key on a different computer&#63;</h2>
                    Hello.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In october this year I bought Windows 8 Pro from the official website and it worked fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I bought a new computer with Windows 8 installed. I then wanted to use my Windows 8 Pro key on a different computer, so I uninstalled Windows 8 from my previous computer, and installed Windows 7 again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BUT I still can't use the product key on the other computer - it keeps saying that the product key is already used on another computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please can someone tell me what to do? Thanks!<span>
</span></div>

            <p>Hello ThomasKanto,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product key is already in use because you have already activated it on one machine. If you then move the operating system to another machine then Microsoft log it as a product key already in use. This is to prevent the operating system being installed
 on multiple PCs using the same product key number. This is, of course, in contravention of the End User Licence Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to use telephone activation. See this link from my website:

<h3> boltonhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Randomly changing shortcut icons</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; Some of my shortcut icons (desktop and IE8) change randomly from time to time.&nbsp; I cannot find some of my icons even when I search my computer for *.ico, yet the icons appear on the wrong shortcuts.&nbsp; I believe it is just
 the missing icons that change as the ones I found in my search are stable.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Did you make any change to the computer recently?<br />
2. Do these icons open the right application or a program that they are assigned to?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
If the icons open an inappropriate application then the file association on your computer is corrupted and the default program to open files is set to Windows Live Photo gallery.&nbsp;<br />
Follow link that will automatically fix the file associations <strong>‘When you run an .exe file on a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer, the file may start a different program’:<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
Let us rebuild the Windows 7 Icon cache.<br />
How to rebuild your Windows 7 Icon Cache: <br />
a. Stop Explorer (use theTask Manager to do this) <br />
b. Open the command prompt; type cmd in the Start Search box, right click the cmd.exe in the list and then click "run as Administrator" and go to: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local<br />
c. Unhide the IconCache.db file with the following command: attrib -h IconCache.db<br />
d. Delete the IconCache.db file: del IconCache.db <br />
e. Start Explorer (or restart your computer). <br />
Please let us know if this helped to resolve your issue or if you still need further assistance.</div>
<div><br />
If you are able to fix the file associations, you should run a Malware scan on your computer to check if this is caused by a virus infection.<br />
You can follow the below link and run a Malware scan on your computer: <br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">‘The

<p>In the ‘Skype Properties’ window the following is shown:</p>

<p>Under ‘General’ – ‘Type of file’, ‘Shortcut (.Ink)’ is shown.</p>
<p>Under ‘Description’ – ‘Skype’ is shown.</p>
<p>Under ‘Shortcut’ – ‘Target type’, ‘Application’ is shown.</p>
<p>Under ‘Shortcut’ – ‘Target location’, ‘Skype for Desktop’ is shown.</p>

 to NOT buy one.</p>

            I've had the same issue. I was really sad to read reports that Microsoft has supposedly stopped work on a second generation elite controller. That would have been the only hope of having this issues fixed. The 90 day warranty is a joke! If your going to
 create the "Elite" controller for the "Hardcore" gamer, you should back it up with a commitment that shows just how much you value that customer.

<p>As Browny says, its almost certain that a controller update will resolve it.</p>
<p>here is a link on how to do it</p>

<p>If that doesn't resolve it, it'd help if you let us know what your setup is and what headset you are using etc.</p>
<p>...for example, I had the same problem a while ago I am using the headset adaptor and plugged in a pair of wireless Ear Force Deltas.</p>
<p>I could hear people but couldn't communicate. Turned out I'd accidentally put the optic wire in the wrong port on the Wireless Base unit! (facepalm)</p>
