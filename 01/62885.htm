<h2>            Most Used is empty in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded from Win 7 to 10 and the 'Most used' (the items on the left when Start Menu is clicked) was full of junk so I right-click "don't show in this list" to clear it all and let it repopulate. &nbsp;I did the same with my laptop and have the same settings,
 but it's not re-populating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most important program to have there for me is Excel as it has the little arrow next to it showing the most recently used spreadsheets and any you've pinned. &nbsp;When I first upgraded Excel was there and I cleared it to try to get it to repolulate from
 scratch (as other items weren't adding) so have I somehow set it to never show there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting I have are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show most used apps ON</p>
<p>Show recently added apps ON</p>
<p>Show recently opened items in Jump List on start of the taskbar ON</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rest are off.</p>

            <p>It's not corrupted, it's a flaw in Windows 10: if you click "Don't show in this list" you can never ever get it back. &nbsp;So if you accidentally click something (for example me, who uses Excel more than all other PROGRAMS (not apps) combined) then it;s gone

<h2>            Master File Table &#40;MFT&#41; issues on several systems</h2>
                    
<p>Last week I ran chkdsk on my desktop and it reported errors. I ran with /f on restart and then ran chkdsk again after the reboot. It referenced errors in the Master File Table (MFT), such as "correcting errors in&nbsp; the master file table's (MFT) BITMAP attribute"
 and "Correcting errors in the Volume Bitmap." I can run chkdsk /f all day and the error never goes away. Other than this, the system is up and running but I am very worried about it.
<br />
<br />
Today I turned on my laptop, which I use about once a week and decided to make sure there were no disk errors. But it is showing the same MFT issue! Yikes, what is going on? I have appropriate anti-virus/anti-spyware protection on all systems.
<br />
<br />
Has MS installed an update recently that is messing up the MFT? How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Ken</p>

            Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
Try running a chkdsk /r instead to perform a deep scan on the drives.<br />
<br />
If the AV protection is the same on all affected PCs, then its possibly related. Try disabling the protection and then running your disk checks, and see if the problem does not then reoccur.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Use another scanner to check your PC is completely clean- <a href="http://www.eset.com/onlinescan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/onlinescan/</a><br />
<br />
Lastly establish the physical disk health is good: Try Passmarks DiskCheckup- <a href="http://www.passmark.com/products/diskcheckup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Btw, this is XP Pro.<br />
<br />
I just read where chkdsk in read-only mode does not always report accurate information. However, another utility, "TestDisk", seems to think the MFT is bad (although it cannot fix it).<br />
<br />
What are the odds that two of my systems would suddendly develop this same problem...?<br />

<br />
I did run chkdsk /r on the desktop system and it didn't help.<br />
<br />
The AV protection is different on the two systems (AVG vs Bitdefender), but I haven't tried chkdsk with AV off (and never had to do that before to get a normal "no errors" result).<br />
<br />
My local computer store (also a Dell reseller) verified that the disk and controller are good.<br />

            Okay, I'm trying to think about this differently, relative to the comment that chkdsk read-only may not give accurate results.<br />
<br />
One would think that chkdsk /f (run before the OS gets in the way) would tell me if anything really bad is going on, right?<br />
<br />
So I just ran it 3 times and got the following results:<br />
<br />
<br />
1st time:<br />
<span>Cleaning up minor inconsistencies on the drive.<br />
Cleaning up 2 unused index entries from index $SII of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 2 unused index entries from index $SDH of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 2 unused security descriptors.</span><br />
<br />
2nd time:<br />
<span>Cleaning up minor inconsistencies on the drive.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused index entries from index $SII of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused index entries from index $SDH of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused security descriptors.</span><br />
<br />
3rd time:<br />
<span>Cleaning up minor inconsistencies on the drive.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused index entries from index $SII of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused index entries from index $SDH of file 0x9.<br />
Cleaning up 1 unused security descriptors.<br />
<br />
<br />
So can I trust chkdsk /f is logging everything that is going on?<br />
<br />
Does this mean chkdsk read-only is completely bogus?&nbsp;I've never seen it give such scary messages before, such as MFT errors! What could have changed more recently to cause that?<br />
<br />
I'm starting to feel a little better...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Here are my final conclusions about this issue...&nbsp; and thanks to everyone who replied.<br />
<br />
I ran chkdsk in read-only mode (while the OS is running) and it reported serious errors (MFT errors).<br />
<br />
I then ran chkdsk /f at restart time and it fixes whatever it fixes.<br />
<br />
I then run chkdsk in read-only mode again and it still reports the serious errors, as if nothing has been fixed yet.<br />
<br />
This can continue over and over again, making it very frustrating and alarming.<br />
<br />
THE SECRET IS: DO NOT TRUST WHAT CHKDSK IN READ-ONLY MODE TELLS YOU. IN FACT DO NOT EVEN RUN IT AT ALL. ONLY USE CHKDSK /F AND BELIEVE WHAT IT TELLS YOU!<br />
<br />
Chkdsk /f runs before the operating system is active, so the file system is in a static state that chkdsk can deal with in an accurate way.<br />
<br />
With chkdsk /f, you have to go see the results in the event viewer, and you may have to run it a few times in this mode to correct all problems, but believe what it tells you and never believe what chkdsk in read-only mode tells you. In fact, IMHO, MS should
 remove the ability to run it in read-only mode!<br />
<br />
Now that I understand all this, my mind is finally at peace...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ken<br />

System Restore is *not* an appropriate way to try to get rid of a virus or any other kind of malware.&nbsp; It hardly ever works correctly for that purpose. How did you know you were infected with a&nbsp; virus? What anti-virus program do you use? Why didn't you use
 it to get of the virus?</p>

            Virus was web based. It is that international cyber security protection alliance maleware virus. I am runing McAfee antivirus but it didn;t catch it. Virus hit this morning. I already did the system restore and set back to yeaterday, now the system cannot
 re-start&nbsp;and is caught in this endless loop of trying to start normally then shutting down with the blue screen eror then tries to restart and get back to the black start screen where you choose to start in safe mode.

    <title>Mouse Cursor changes to excel cross when on second screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Cursor changes to excel cross when on second screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our users has reported a strange bug, and has us stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When his mouse is on his 3rd screen (laptop and two screens, using dell dock), it changes from the regular cursor to the excel cross, as if there is a spreadsheet open there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I suggested was restart, so he did, and the mouse still changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second thing i checked was to see if his graphics/dock drivers are up to date - they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then spent some time searching online for this issue, and found nothing similar. There are a few where the mouse changes to weird shapes, which was solved by adding mouse trails and changing trail length to the smallest. On this laptop it simply trails
 the excel mouse..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to replies, and suggestions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Callum</p>

<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

<h2>            Amd_cleanup_util_1.2.1.0.exe Use Kills Admin Rights on all Admin Accounts in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <div>This error pops up often: "explore.exe ..the activation requires a display name to be present under the CLSID key"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please stop AMD from killing more installs of Windows 8 ....I am planning a picket of their biggest outlets ..on YouTube then the media.
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
As spoken of later under "User and Windows Update section missing from PC Setting in Windows 8, along with other errors", the Amd/Ati Driver cleanup utility.exe still offered at the AMD download site is totally screwing up Permissions on all Admin Accounts
 on the Windows 8 computer. I have no control of UAC, Power Options, User accounts control or creation. I cannot create a new user admin account and delete the old as it is unavailable.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You are not even allowed to empty your own Recycle Bin! But CCleaner has that right still!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many files cannot be deleted or moved unless the new UNLOCKER program is used. &nbsp;I have two Admin accounts, it borked both.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft Accounts Troubleshooter did not fix it. Action center sees NO PROBLEMS!<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has been many months since this destructive program from AMD was uncovered here and NOTHING has been done by AMD or Microsoft. It should have been pulled. Now I will be forced to reinstalled 450 games and programs carefully groomed in my arcade collection.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there ANYWAY to do a COMMAND LINE refresh of Admin rights to accounts like in the older: "Subinacl /directoriesonly C:\ &nbsp;/setowner=administrator" which does not work in Windows 8? I do not want to try System Restore as I read it does not work on this
 and I have too many new changes I do not want to lose. I have ERUNT registry restore points but fear to use them as well.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform System restore to date where the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To restore your PC using System Restore
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span> Enter <span>Recovery</span> in the search box, tap or click
<span>Settings</span>, and then tap or click <span>Recovery</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Open System Restore</span>, and follow the prompts.
</p>
</li></ol>
<span><font color="#000000">Note:<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>System restore will restore your computer to a prior time when the computer was working fine. So any changes made to the computer after the restore point will be erased.</font></span>

            <p>Since you have performed System Restore, the file that were downloaded prior to the system restore point might have been deleted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to download them once again to get rid of the games issues.</p>

 they are system files that the Mac uses and are normally hidden on a Mac (they do not appear Finder, the Windows Explorer equivalent on a Mac). &nbsp;I also want to hide them in Windows Explorer so that I just see my real data files. &nbsp;Any idea how to do this?&nbsp;

            Hi,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Rogelio. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />This is the same error when it comes to opening Office 2016, it is likely that you are not running Office but this can solve the problem if you have Office and you can give it in repair to restore the dll.

<div>AS the other post says the windows update has made eaglesoft not work. IE11 seems to be the issue, but cannot uninstall it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cannot see any windows updates......update history shows as bunch of windows updates, but installed updates only&nbsp;shows adobe and .net
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried the:</div>

</div>
<div>gives me a bunch of access errors even though I am logged on as local admin, tried as domain admin as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>IE11 shows up in windows features and I can turn it off, but I need IE10 to work and it won't with IE11 gumming up the works.</div>

            <p>Thank you for beginning your own, new thread to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply - preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. Does the computer-in-question belong to you or a client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. When (approx. date) was the computer purchased?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1c. Did Win7 (64-bit) come preinstalled on the computer when it was brand-new or...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. Was <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft Security Essentials</font></a> (MSE) originally offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you (or your client)&nbsp;intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting
<strong>General</strong> tab?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c. What ANTIMALWARE CLIENT version is currently installed? To find out, open MSE &amp; click on the downward-pointing arrow to the right of HELP then select ABOUT SECURITY ESSENTIALS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2d. Is MSE installed on more than ten (10) computers in the dental practice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before MSE was installed</em>, was&nbsp;the subscription still current, and&nbsp;was it&nbsp;uninstalled before MSE was installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when it was brand-new? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br /> See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.

<h2>            NTFS.SYS BSOD Loop - Unique Situation</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Hi</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">This is my first post on the forums as i'm unable to find the solution online. I've searched
 all over Google for a similar case to mine and i'm yet to find any.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I recently ran in to a BSOD during gaming on Windows 10 64-bit. It occurred when I was
 playing Black Ops 4. I managed to get two quick games in and a BSOD occurred on the third session.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I then managed to reboot in to Windows and my nVidia drivers were out of date for Black
 Ops 4, I downloaded them and noticed Windows had a security update also. I installed the Windows update AFTER the nVidia drivers. I've now learnt that those Window drivers were Spectre/Meltdown patches, which for some reason, Windows hadn't installed when
 they first came out.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I was unable to rectify the BSOD occurrance and it continued to happen when trying to
 run the Black Ops 4 client and the launcher itself. This got worse and eventually lead to a BSOD loop. The BSOD each time was different, never came over a pattern or anything to point me in the right direction.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I was initially able to boot in to Safe Mode in Windows and remove all recent drivers
 to see if it was an issue from that perspective, this did not resolve the BSOD issues I was having. I eventually decided on a fresh install for Windows 10 via USB. This installed fine and I figured I had a corrupt driver. After the fresh install, I attempted
 to apply my overclock settings and XMP profile to the CPU and RAM respectively. For information, I was previously sat at 5ghz on the i5 7600k CPU @1.29vcore, with the XMP Profile set to 3000Mhz which was the rated speed for the RAM I bought. This has been
 running stable since October 2017, not one single BSOD from this set up. On attempting to apply the same settings, I was only able to clock the CPU at 4.5ghz @1.29vcore. A whole 500mhz out! I assumed this was because of the Spectre/Meltdown patches. The RAM
 continued to run at the rated 3000Mhz via the XMP Profile.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Two days went by and I was streaming a football match online. 80 minutes in and the system
 BSOD again! I wasn't doing anything unusual and the system was running as normal, no lagging or display issues to pre-warn of a BSOD.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">This time around there was a common theme around NTFS.SYS BSOD, it occurred more often
 than not and sometimes pointed towards a Kernel issue. I didn't make note of the BSOD codes at the time but it was primarily an NTFS.SYS code. I'm now stuck in a permanent BSOD loop. I can't boot to safe mode, advanced repair or install Windows 10 from a USB
 without a BSOD occurring. There are times when Windows will boot in to the desktop, but on trying to do ANYTHING, it'll BSOD.</span><br />

            Hi many different BSODs usually says about memory problems or any hardware faults - motherboard or processor.
<br />First of all remove overclocking and I recommend some downclocking for test.

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

</p><p>Unable to post minidumps that have been generated. I'm unable to boot in to Windows 10 on normal settings, safe mode, advanced repair etc. I cannot physically get on to Windows 10 due to BSOD loop. Sometimes it'll boot in to Windows after a BSOD and it'll
 immediately BSOD when I try to open the start menu or interact with any of the programmes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even run a Windows 10 USB installation tool without a BSOD occurring. It attempts to load in and either BSODs immediately or after i've navigated to one of the first menus in the tool.</p>

            Not very strange. Seems hardware is damaged. 
<br />I still suggest deepest downclocking for test  - chance is not big but it exists. If possible, try another processor.

            Thanks for the response. I'll downclock it tonight. I believe the motherboard may be at fault. I just find it a huge coincidence that I update my drivers and Windows security patches and all of a sudden a stable system has damaged hardware after 10 months
 from new.&nbsp;

            Each specimen of hardware is different in possibility to work under pressure (overclocking) - some may work for years and some -only few month or even weeks. Overclocking use safety margin and this margin changes from specimen to specimen.

<p>Hi Igor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've underclocked my CPU from 3.8ghz stock to 2ghz. It's now running stable on Windows OS. I believe either the motherboard or CPU are at fault. My concern is that recent firmware/software updates on Windows and the BIOS have corrupted the system. I'm going
 to wipe my SSD tonight and reinstall Windows from fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's particularly worth noting that my GPU drivers rolled back to their original version for no reason in Windows during this issue of the BSOD loop. I believe the OS is corrupt for sure, but I believe there may be a deeper, underlying issue with the CPU
 and or motherboard. Personally I think it's the motherboard, especially considering i've been drawing a lot from the VRM's on the CPU the last ten months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to order another CPU and test it on the motherboard over the coming days.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So i've managed to manually clock my CPU to 3.8ghz (which is the processors stock base speed) and I have my RAM running with XMP turned on (3000mhz). Anything above these settings on the CPU and it BSODs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Wimfyf.SYS BSODs with no code attached, or there's just a BSOD with no explanation or error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had BSODs around graphics drivers, i'm unable to post the minidump at the moment, i'm in work, i'll attempt to this evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On attempting to look at the dump files last night, I was only able to view the latest one. Anything before was corrupt. Is this normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a genuine loss as to what the issue could be now. I've removed my graphics drivers with third party software, whilst running in safe mode. I've reinstalled the latests graphics drivers and i've flashed my bios to the latest version, installed Windows
 10 fresh, run a memtest for a couple of hours, underclocked my CPU, installed all new drivers, wiped my hard drives, removed as many peripherals as possible in different scenario settings, tried every RAM slot in different configurations. Nothing has solved
 the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only areas I think there can be a problem, are the CPU or the motherboard. The BSODs are only highlighting either the VGA side of things being an issue or the Windows OS being corrupt. This only seems to occur when I try to run my CPU at stock settings
 or overclocked. I've checked the motherboard for earthing issues, had it out of the PC tower on a bench, looked at all the capacitors for damage or the board in general, reset CMOS on several occassions. I've re-applied thermal paste to the CPU, both on the
 die (delidded) and on the copper heatsink. If there was an issue with my CPU, surely it would fail to turn on the system at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on any further testing I could do, getting desperate now.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get zoom slider to display in Streets &#38; Trips.</h2>
                    I have Streets &amp; Trips 2009 and have appreciated the "zoom slider" for sizing my maps.&nbsp; (Yes, I know how to use the diagonal right-mouse button drag, but don't like that as much.).&nbsp; A few days ago when I opened Streets &amp; Trips, the zoom slider had disappeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips Help window merely states, "Click on the Zoom Slider buttoms to zoom in or out."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Further research indicates that the zoom slider should be displayed on the "Location and Scale" toolbar.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; All that shows is a&nbsp;mileage scale legend.<br />
<br />
I've clicked on the Toolbar menu selection, but cannot find the zoom slider listed among the options.&nbsp; I have turned off all the Toolbar selections and reselected them one-by-one, just in case the zoom slider had been overlaid by another.<br />
<br />
I have reinstalled the program in the repair mode, but that didn't solve it.<br />
<br />
How do I display the zoom slider?

<h2>            Windows 7 slows to a standstill after booting</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; Been searching through the forums and could not find a fix for my problem.&nbsp; About a week ago my computer started running slow and as of yesterday it has come to a screeching halt.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 - 64 bit home premium, i5 2.53 processor and
 8 GB of RAM.&nbsp; Every time I boot the computer it will be fine for about thirty seconds and then it starts running, and it keeps running for no apparent reason.&nbsp; Everything else stops responding and I've tried everything I can but I can't get it to stop.&nbsp; I
 boot up in safe mode and it runs fine.&nbsp; I have tried the msconfig.exe fix and narrowed it down to the microsoft services that are causing the problem.&nbsp; Once I start trying to single out the microsoft services, it happens for a lot of them and I haven't been
 able to identify a single or even a couple of services that might be causing the problem.&nbsp; I have done a full system scan with norton, multiple times and nothing comes up as a threat.&nbsp

<p>Presumably the msconfig fix you refer to, is removing unnecessary programs/services from starting up, here are some additional things you can check out:</p>
<p>1. Turn off Scheduled defragmentation via Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Defragmentation. However, every so often you need to check if any disks have become excessively fragmented, which can affect disk performance.
<br />
2. Check if your antivirus program is scanning at boot time. This can be run when you feel it needs to be run, not at every start up. Also, disable it for a while to determine if the real-time protection is the culprit.<br />
3. You’ll get a slightly faster start up if you optimise the boot files and applications by running a special defragmentation from an elevated CMD prompt, i.e. click the Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories and right-click Command Prompt, then ‘Run
 as Administrator’. Type defrag C:\ -b (note the two spaces) and press Enter. Depending upon your computer specification, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to run.<br />
4. Disable any Services that you do not use, e.g. FAX, Parental Controls, Remote Registry and WMP Network Sharing. This is done by clicking the Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Administration Tools &gt; Services. Scroll down and Stop, then Disable any that
 are not used.<br />
5. Although hard disk errors are rare, they can slow up the machine, so it‘s worth spending a bit of time checking. Click Computer &gt; right-click the hard disk drive that you want to check &gt; Properties &gt; Tools Tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check
 Now. <br />
6. To see which tasks are running, open a Run window (Windows key+R), type cmd /k tasklist /svc (note the three spaces) and press Enter. Close the cmd prompt when you have finished viewing it. To get a better description of the associated Service(s), go to
 Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) &gt; Processes Tab and on a specific Svchost, right-click it &gt; Go to Service(s) to see all the Services, which are highlighted.<br />
Alternatively, use Process Explorer to see which services are running. To see the svchost processes, let the mouse pointer hover over each svchost.exe in the left pane.

                    <p>I'm having some issues with machines hanging at please wait... with errors 5719 then 1055 in the event logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the KB article it's not clear what setting is used from <span>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\History
</span>to set the timeout as it's not one we're defining via group policy. I'll of course do some testing using group policy to define the setting to a test OU, but if anyone does know if either CurrentWaitAtStartup or AvgWaitTimeoutAtStartup is the value used
 to determine the timeout I'd be very intreasted to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also be some other value entirely they just look like the two most possible options form that KB article, but I'm failing to get my head round exactly what value I am meant to look up from:

<h2>            Parental control on Xbox purchases</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 4 years old kid is playing Forza and he purchases cars. Tried to explain him, but didn't work.
</p>
<p>How can I lock the account or to add a code before each purchase?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            You can add a passkey by going to the settings app, once you are on the settings app you should immediately see sign in security and passkey select that. Once you have selected that select change my sign-in &amp; security preferences, after you select that
 select Ask for my passkey, if you do not have a passkey I believe it will let you create one. Once you have created the account's passkey go back to where you selected Ask for my passkey but don't select it this time instead go to the right and you should
 see Customize select it. Once you have selected it you should see Ask for my passkey at sign-in select it and choose passkey not required. Then you're done!

            <p>Actually the passkey and the privacy settings work only on a child account/ If you have set your 4 years old kid account as adult you can't control it </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64-bit, GA-970A-DS3P, SATA-3 slow HD and also USB 2.0 issues</h2>
                    <p>Let me start this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
<p>Motherboard: GA-970A-DS3P</p>
<p>1) WD Caviar Black HD: 3 nos of 1TB each. One for OS, one for Apps and one for Swap. (Don't ask&nbsp; how i ended up with this config: that's a long upgrade story).</p>
<p>2) GTX 550 Ti graphics card.</p>
<p>3) AMD Phenom x4 965 BE: all 4 cores unlocked . <strong>NOT overclocked.</strong></p>
<p>4) DDr3 RAM 8GB (2 sticks)</p>
<p>5) Rest include 1 SATA DVD Drive, Cooler Master monstrous fins CPU cooler (that cut my fingers twice), and a 650W PSU (Cooler Master)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
<p>1) Windows 7 64-bit ultimate (fresh installation)</p>
<p>2) MS Office 2010</p>
<p>3) Acronis True Image 2012</p>
<p>4) Adobe Creative cloud: Adobe Acrobat Pro XI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BIO Settings</strong>:</p>
<p>1) all set to AHCI SATA.</p>
<p>2) xHCI enabled. (no clue)</p>
<p>3) eHCI enabled. (no clue)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong>:</p>
<p>1st setup&nbsp;Gigabyte's SATA AHCI drivers and USB 3.0 drivers. All drivers except keyboard &amp; mouse are from Gigabyte.</p>
<p>2nd setup (after i discovered it was dead slow): DriverMax provided SATA 3.0 AHCI drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows boots up to GUI login screen in 40 to 43 seconds after POST.&nbsp; (Used to do it under 30 seconds before i installed MS Office).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem and diagnostics i did:</strong></p>
<p>1) primary HD is extremely slow in responding. It just takes an inordinate time to respond to heavy HD activity. (Like when i try to copy a large file to the C drive or read from C drive).</p>
<p>2) I used Perfmon.exe to monitor Avg Disk Queue length and % Disk time. Disk queue length on C drive starts from 0.117 and rises to 24.26 in a matter of 20 mins after i boot. % disk time stays high at 118.98 or even above.</p>
<p>3) Surprisingly USB 3.0 flash drive reported a speed of 118MB/second on copying a file of 3.4GB from D drive to USB 3.0</p>
<p>4) USB 2.0 reported avg 28MB/second which was expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) After i removed Gigabyte SATA drivers, i used one from Drivermax (don't know what it was).&nbsp; Yes, i did delete old drivers, rebooted and then installed drivermax drivers.</p>
<p>6) Disk queue length dropped to 0.28 on average when copying from/to C drive and even under heavy operations.</p>
<p>7) Windows experience index stays at 5.9 for primary HD.</p>
<p>8) Avg speed of C drive now is about 128 to 132MB/second (seriously?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) I don't find any exclamation or question marks in Device manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) Now, as of yesterday, the speeds dropped down again (no driver updates, but Windows crucial updates done). Again Avg disk queue length has risen slowly to about 24.23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) I did a chkdsk c: /R but could not find any HD surface errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) i switched controller cables and plugged them into different sockets (thereby cutting myself on the sharp edges of the graphics card and the cooler fins: why can't the HW manufacturers soften the edges: will they lose money?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13) USB 2.0 speeds dropped drastically to 7.28MB/second copying about 1GB of multiple files of 12MB each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am at my wit's end on this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do i have a problematic motherboard? Do i have dumb drivers? Or did i do something wrong here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help fixing this speed problem appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. The system is otherwise snappy and fast with boot times less than 45 seconds even with peripherals connected. Opening apps are quick and system load (as long as i do not touch C drive) are faster.
</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>

            <p>I misinterpreted the word 'nos'.. :-)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Clone the boot drive onto the drive being used for the page file after having removed the partition on the page file drive as in reduce it to unallocated space. Your present boot drive may not be the fittest of its type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It can all be done using Aomei partition assistant, free for home use. </p>

<p>If the computer seems to be ok, stop running performance monitoring software. It can drive a person crazy. Look for other stuff which may be slowing the system down..
