<h2>            Unable to download Microsoft To Do app from store</h2>
                    <p>I'm unable to download one of my favorite productivity apps - Microsoft To Do - from the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; I'm trying to install it on a brand new PC.&nbsp; I've verified I'm signed into the store fine.&nbsp; Each attempt to install, I click on the Install button
 and it goes to "resuming download 40.96MB" and hangs.&nbsp; After a while it pretends that it has installed, but never completes and is not available for use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running wsreset several times as well as clearing the local cache files.&nbsp; I'm at a loss for what to do next.&nbsp; For now I'm using the app via my iOS phone and on the PC via browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; Any hints or tips appreciated!</p>

<h2>            USB &#38; PS&#47;2 Will not work once Windows 10 has started</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I had performed a major cleanup of the desktop system running McAfee Quick Clean, Full Virus Scan (All good) and Windows updates. I even went so far as eliminating my previous Restore Points which normally I would not do but figured I'd just
 get rid of everything.</p>
<p>The system rebooted applying all the patches and started up just fine or so it seemed.</p>
<p>PROBLEM:</p>
<p>The mouse and the keyboard will not work once windows has started.</p>
<p>I have verified that they do work on my laptop.</p>
<p>After many attempts and hours this is all I can determine.</p>
<p>1. The Keyboard lights up briefly when plugged into the USB and stays lit until the Windows 10 begins to boot.</p>
<p>2. The Mouse lights up briefly when plugged into the USB and stays lit until the Windows 10 begins to boot.</p>
<p>3. The Keyboard functions in the PS/2 port allowing me to go into my Bios (All settings for USB are correct)</p>
<p>4. Once Windows begins to boot then both the PS/2 and the USB goes dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have NO WAY to interact with my desktop.</p>
<p>I put my Windows 7 Ultimate CD into the DVD and tried to boot from that but it will not allow me to, I'm guessing because I now have Windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really could use some guidance on how to fix this issue.<br />
</p>

            <p>It was nice to have gotten a response but it seems like a complete cookie cutter response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my original posting, I have NO WAY to interact with the Windows 10. I cannot navigate, I cannot type anything, I cannot select anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the USB and the PS/2 connections with different mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>The only thing I can do is navigate in the BIOS.</p>
<p>Once Windows begins the bootup then the USB and the PS/2 devices no longer work.</p>
<p>As for my system, I built it several years back.</p>
<p>Running I7 processor on ASUS motherboard, 12GB ram, four 1TB SATA drives with a RAID configuration for the primary drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not worried about my data because I have 2 drives setup for storing all of my files.</p>
<p>I just don't want to have to go through the hassle of reinstalling all the various software on my system over something as small as this issue.</p>

            <p>I contacted Microsoft support and got a little bit of help at least towards trying to get things up and running.</p>
<p>Media tool gives the option to save Windows 10 as an ISO or USB or to do a instant upgrade without burning it.<br />
Here's the link for the media tool.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try and burn a DVD and boot from that. Hopefully I'll be able to get back in.</p>
<p>If not then I'll need to reinstall Windows 7 Ultimate then do an upgrade.</p>
<p>Note: You can always buy a license for Windows 10 and just install it directly but I'd rather not spend any more money.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I purchased a non driver based basic PS2 Mouse and Keyboard from amazon.</p>
<p>Plugged them into the system and booted up Windows.</p>
<p>The PS2 Mouse and Keyboard works.</p>
<p>Note: The USB Mouse and Keyboard with the PS2 adapter will not work.</p>
<p>However, the USB drivers under the device manager all have issues, I tried to update drivers but it was not able to update any of the items that now have an issue. I'll post a screenshot later when I get back home.</p>

<h2>            BSOD in Windows 7 since adding Office 07 and Windows updates.</h2>
                    
<p>How do I keep my 1 month old HP computer (Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit)&nbsp;from shutting down and blue-screening at random times?&nbsp; First thing I did when I got it was to slowly add programs I had used on XP safely in the past.&nbsp; I run Comcast w/McAfee and virus
 scan came up negative.&nbsp; However, just recently, I added Microsoft Office 2007 Ultimate Steal and all the Microsoft updates that appeared appropriate...I think that's when the trouble started.&nbsp; Since then, I have had random crashes and/or shutdowns.&nbsp; Any advice
 from the experts would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!!!<br />
<br />
Below is a&nbsp;common reason given:<br />

I don't think the problem has anything to do with having installed Office Ultimate 2007.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>=&gt; If the computer came with a Norton free-trial preinstalled, <strong>STOP HERE!</strong> and reply to this post.<br />
<br />
===============<br />
<br />
It's<em> possible</em> that the McAfee application is causing these STOP errors. Let's find out:<br />
<br />
1. Download the installer for Microsoft Security Essentials* (MSE), saving the download to your desktop:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Close all open applications (anything with an icon on taskbar) and repeat Steps #1 and #2 (only) of the McAfee three-step fix &amp; reboot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. IMMEDIATELY make 100% certain that the Windows Firewall is enabled!<br />
<br />
4. Close all open applications (anything with an icon on taskbar) then right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to install MSE; follow all prompts.<br />
<br />
5. After rebooting, manually &amp; repeatedly update MSE until you get a "no more updates" prompt.<br />
<br />
6. Test.<br />
<br />
If the behavior persists, contact HP Support ASAP under terms of your Warranty or Service Contract.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
* I'm only using MSE as&nbsp;a guinea pig here. You don't necessarily have to leave it installed when we're done with our troubleshoointing but I would not reinstall the McAfee freebie just yet&nbsp;IIWY nor would I install any Norton application.</div>

            Hi Robert, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your PC originally had Windows 10 Home installed, and you've installed Pro, is that correct?
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 Home license is built into the PC if it's an OEM license, which means you'll either need to reinstall Windows 10 Home or use a purchased Windows 10 Pro license to activate.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to install Windows 10 Home, you can do this using the Media Creation Tool to create an installation USB drive. Keep in mind that this will remove all your apps and files.
<br />
<br />Here's the link to download the Media Creation Tool:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />This error message generally indicates your PC is licenced to Windows 10 Home and somehow Windows 10 Pro is now installed on your PC.
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If your PC is in fact meant to have Windows 10 Pro installed, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Call/Chat/Schedule a Call
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Or choose a local Phone Number: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>
<br />
<br />2
<br />If your PC is meant to have Windows 10 Home, then you will need to backup your data, clean install Windows 10 Home Edition, then restore your data and re-install all your 3rd party applications . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Want to upgrade from Win 8.0 Pro to 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    I am keen to upgrade from Win 8 Pro to Win 8.1 Pro, but attempting to download from the Windows Store crashes every time, as does the option to download the ISO file (my preference, if it had worked). I'm guessing that my internet connection being on a
 metered mobile network may be at least part of the problem, although I don't know.
<div>I had previously posted here on the Community about this, and <b>was advised that then Microsoft WOULD be making the 8.1 upgrade available on DVD... BUT WHEN?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;The download has been available since October, and it's now almost January. &nbsp;Come on, Microsoft,
 what's the hold-up?</div>

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really infortunate that you are not able to install Windows 8.1 via Windows Store on a metered connection.<br />
<strong>Upgrading with a metered Internet connection</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download-metered-internet-connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download-metered-internet-connection</a></p>
<p><br />
<br />
There is no free ISO download for Windows 8.1 but if you would purchase it from the Microsoft store then you will be able to download the Windows 8.1 ISO files.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Refer to the blog.</p>
<p><span><u><font color="#0000ff">http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/10/17/windows-8-1-now-available.aspx</font></u></span><span> Brandon LeBlanc in the comments "We're not releasing the ISO images to folks who don't have MSDN and
 TechNet subscriptions. Best way for everyone else is to update through the Windows Store."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span>As of 30-Oct-2013, Windows 8.1 media are now available via Supplement Parts.<br />
You will need to go through Supplemental Parts and have the media shipped to them at a cost of $20 USD or local currency equivalent.</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm pleased to hear that the 8.1 media are now available, but as items sent to Greece from the USA are charged stupid import fees,
<b>I really need to order the upgrade on DVD from the UK.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you provide me with<b> a link to the UK Microsoft Store</b>, or<b> better still a straightforward e-mail link to someone at Microsoft UK who can solve my problem.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I do not understand why Microsoft make it so hard to send them a simple e-mail enquiry... &nbsp;There are times before I've simply given up trying!</div>

            Hi again Rajith,
<div><br />
<div>Followed your links and finally got through to Microsoft Uk, who advise there is NO option to purchase the Windows 8.1 Pro Upgrade on DVD. &nbsp;It's download or nothing, and despite having followed all the instructions the straight download AND the ridiculous
 round-about method of downloading the ISO both crash for me EVERY time before the download even starts.</div>
<div><b>So this is one seriously unhappy customer...</b></div>
<div>I am actually now considering dumping Windows 8 altogether and going back to the far better Windows 7 despite the inconvenience that would incur.</div>
<div>I am astounded that Microsoft have taken this approach, as I cannot be the only customer who is unable to access the "free" 8.1 upgrade.</div>
<div><b>I appreciate all your assistance, but am pretty disgusted by Microsoft's stance on this.</b></div>
<div>You may consider this enquiry closed now.</div>

            I decided to stick with Win 8.0 after I discovered and added Stardock's 'Start 8' plug-in which restores sanity as well as the standard Start button and menu.
<div>Start 8 allows you (if you want) to boot straight to the desktop, and get rid of the metro interface - another huge improvement.</div>
<div>I have also now killed the infuriating reminder to update to Win 8.1 which kept on coming up following registry editing instructions I found via Google, asking &nbsp;'How do I stop the Windows 8.1 update reminder?'</div>
<div>Hope this helps others!</div>

<p>Do you have any type of 3rd party security or firewall that may be causing a problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's crashing before the download even starts I wouldn't think that would be a metered connection problem... unless it is somehow rejecting it based on the file size.</p>

            Hi.
<div><br />
<div>I've tried the 8.1 download both with and without my firewall/anti-virus running. I use F-Secure Internet Security 2014. &nbsp;Same result every time, crashes before starting to download the file.</div>
<div>I have already decided, however, that I'm not going to try again, as the size of this download puts a real squeeze on my monthly mobile internet limit, and frankly it isn't worth the hassle. &nbsp;Stardock's 'Start 8' does exactly what I wanted 8.1 to do, with
 minimal cost, and absolutely NO hassle.</div>
<div>I'm still stunned by Microsoft not making a DVD available for this update... loads of people have mobile internet, and I can's imagine many being keen on the size of the download. Speak about making things difficult... Not what I expect from Microsoft,
 and when Win 9 comes around, I won't be so fast to make the upgrade.</div>

<p>I opened a chat with a community ambassador for help. I typed my question and&nbsp; when the person responded they asked for my gamertag. I replied with the gamertag and then was asked for my username and password. I replied that I didn't think I should give
 out that info and my chat session immediately ended. It says in the beginning that they should not ask these personal questions so beware. There was a link to report the abuse but I was not able to click on it for some reason. Every time I moved the mouse
 to it the page would scroll down to the bottom. Very odd.</p>

<p>Greetings Lion,</p>
<p>Remember, Xbox Community Ambassadors are NOT official Microsoft support agents; they are just friendly Xbox users, like you!</p>
<p>DO NOT share any personal information with your Ambassador including:</p>
<p>-Your name</p>
<p>-Windows Live ID</p>
<p>-Account password</p>
<p>If they ask for this information, please report them to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and include the entire chat transcript, along with the date and time (and time zone) of your conversation. Thank you.</p>
<p>Please ask your Xbox question. Try to be specific so we can best match you with a Community Ambassador who can help.</p>

<p>Hey there Arduous,<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry to hear about your experience with that ambassador and you definitely made the right call not giving out that information.<br />
<br />
That conversation has most likely already been flagged by the system but we can also go in manually and find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you happen to remember the title of the topic for your chat or the approximate time/date of the chat?&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><br />
That will help us speed up the investigation process.</p>

<p>Putting the original disk back should get you going again.</p>
<p>You did not say which partition wizard you used but it seems something went wrong in the process, or maybe you missed some detail in the instructions.</p>

            HI XV.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Partition Wizard is not an imaging app.  I recommend using the expert's choice free Macrium to clone or image over Windows from your hard drive to SSD. 
<br />See this guide for how:
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>

<br />
<br />If imaging doesn't work then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>So the problem is I can’t perform imaging at the moment I suppose because the hdd is empty</p>

<p>Sorry, I do not understand. When you clone a disk then you make an exact replica of the source disk on the target disk. The source disk is not affected in any way. It seems you did something entirely different. What exactly did you do?</p>

<h2>            no puedo conectar mi cuenta a xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>Hola, resulta que hoy al encender la consola no logro conectar mi perfil al live. Probe la conexion en la configuracion y no existe ni un problema, de hecho con otro perfil me conecta al live sin problemas. Entonces procedi a borrar mi perfil para descargarlo
 de nuevo, al principio no me dejaba porque "el servicio no esta disponible" y luego de unos intentos logre rescatarlo pero tampoco pudo conectarse al live. Llame a soporte y me dijeron que la cta quiza tenia problemas de facturacion y me hicieron el cargo
 de la facturacion en forma manual, me pidieron que bajara mi perfil de nuevo y ahi se pudo conectar. El problema es que a la media hora enciendo la consola y nuevamente el perfil no puede conectarse....la verdad no se que esta pasando, si alguien pudiera hecharme
 una mano estaria muy agradecido.</p>

            Hi Donald,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Mail app issue you're experiencing might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to an incorrect mail server.<br />
<br />
That being said, what were the changes made on your PC, especially on your Mail app? Is your Windows 10 up-to-date?<br />
<br />
Have you tried signing out your email account, then sign it back in? Did the same result occur?<br />
<br />
You may also run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Apps Troubleshooter</a></strong> to find and repair problems with your Windows applications,
 including your Mail app.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Surface Pro 3  - Will not charge with AC adapter but does charge with DC 12v travel charger</h2>
                    <p>In the last 2 weeks my SP3 has v<span>ery abruptly </span>stopped charging using the AC adapter. I thought it was the adapter so I used my Alogic Car charger which works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Perth last week I cleaned the port thoroughly - no change. Tried uninstalling the battery and AC adapter device drivers - no change on reboot. I bought a new SP3 charger - no go. Then I took my SP3 into JBHifi and they kindly let me try charge my device
 on their display models - no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my setup now is a 12v inverter and my car charger. The LED on the 12v mag connector does not turn off, even when disconnected from the port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:</p>
<p>Why does the 12v Charger work but not the AC?</p>
<p>What does the smart charger need from the port to begin charging that the DC charger doesn't?</p>
<p>Is it possible that the AC charger could be hacked so the pins are constantly live?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The rest of the story...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I bought my SP3 second hand for $1000 last year, it is now out of warranty by a few months but I have never dropped or damaged it. During the above processes I contacted MS support twice. Because the device
 is out of warranty they have only offered to replace the device for $749. It is cheaper than repair I am told. I am not willing to accept that my beloved company is so limited in what they will do. It is such a basic yet paralysing fault on an otherwise faultless
 machine!</p>

            Dear MikeJ5
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about your troubles with charging your Surface Pro 3.
<br />
<br />The laptop AC adapter simply serves to convert mains AC to DC, which is used to charge the battery of most electronic devices. In the Surface Pro, there may be additional circuitry within that is involved in this role.
<br />
<br />Therefore, if you are having trouble with the AC adapter but not with DC charging, the problem either lies in the adapter or a charging circuit problem within the Surface Pro 3 - either internally or at the level of the port.
<br />
<br />Your rather extensive troubleshooting seems to have narrowed this to a problem within the Surface Pro 3. Unfortunately the cause in your device is unclear, but in other computers this has been reported from using other brand connectors/external batteries or wear and tear to the charging port.
<br />
<br />Your solution appears to be:
<br />- a relatively expensive out-of-warranty exchange, as you have pointed out, or
<br />- resolving to recharge the SP3 only with external batteries/your car charger. You can try looking for an external battery with pass-through charging as a surrogate for your AC adapter.
<br />
<br />I do not suggest hacking the SP3's charger!       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for your speedy reply RussellKrogan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; It is very odd. I have encountered a few others on forums that have charger port issues but not many seem to have tried the DC charger yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't let go of the fact that it will take charge. I am leaning towards the likelihood that the device or AC charger must sense the other's presence before it will charge. I feel that my DC charger doesn't bother with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep you updated if I don't cook my SP3.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get the Surface to recognize the charger after splitting open the plug and connecting the 2 outside points. Destroyed the plug though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it must be this switch or sensing point on the port that has failed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is the Windows 10 Calendar app SUPPOSED to be able to allow one to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the Windows 10 Calendar app SUPPOSED to be able to allow one to schedule an appointment more than 6 months &#40;167 days really&#41; out &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue scheduling an appointment some months out from today and I'm trying to learn if its simply the way the Windows 10 calendar app is currently programmed to function or if there is something wrong with my pc, in some fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE:</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday January 7th, 2017, the last day that I could successfully schedule a new event was Saturday June 24th.
</p>
<p>If I tried scheduling anything from the June 25th onward, the event would appear briefly in the calendar app on the day of the event, but would simply disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Sunday January 8th, 2017, and the last day that I can successfully schedule a new event is Sunday, June 25th, 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps moving by a day.</p>
<p>So, it "appears" as if there is a set number of days "built in" to the Calendar app itself (167 ?) beyond which, you can't schedule anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What <strong>does</strong> seem to work is if I schedule a reoccurring weekly event that goes beyond June 25th.</p>
<p>Say, every Monday starting today (January 8th).</p>
<p>That works fine in that it appears on the calendar beyond June 25th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you modify the starting date of the series so that it is June 25th or further out, the entire series disappears from the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana allows me to create <strong>reminders</strong>&nbsp;beyond June 25th. </p>
<p>And they appear on the calendar as would be expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal, is to schedule an event for the entire 3rd week in July of this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all available updates applied to my pc.</p>
<p>I have performed all the possible troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>SFC, uninstalling and reinstalling the app itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm beginning to think that the Calendar application simply works this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And MS may or may not address it someday. (I'm not finding fault here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing for sure however, that the Calendar app really does work this way would be a relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for replies.</p>

            <p>Methinks, it has finally occurred to me, what is actually going on.</p>
<p>I have not been paying attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>I schedule an event 6 months out from the present date.</p>
<p>I see it appear on the calendar for a moment and then disappear.</p>
<p>I decide (in error) that the event has not been scheduled. (Because it does not "show" on my calendar.)</p>
<p>But, if I end the Calendar app, restart it and then go to the month where my scheduled event should be, I see the following verbiage across the top of the Calendar app.</p>
<p>"We're not able to show you some of the events in this time range. But they're still there--available via your account provider".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this seems to be correct in that, if I go into the Google Calendar on my Android phone and look at events scheduled for that month (6 months hence), I do indeed see the event that I scheduled via the Windows 10 Calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there doesn't seem to be an issue actually scheduling an event, it's just that, for some reason, it is not showing on the Windows 10 Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder ...</p>
<p>As the time get nearer to the actual scheduled event, if it will suddenly appear on the Windows 10 Calendar ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the reason behind not "showing" events on the Windows 10 calendar 6 months hence even though they are truly scheduled ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a work around for this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS going to address this in the future and if so when ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for thinking about my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out, I still "do" have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cranked up the MS Calendar app.</p>
<p>I fast forwarded to December 2017.</p>
<p>I scheduled a new event. (On December 5th.)</p>
<p>If, in the event scheduling dialog box, I choose "Calendar - Microsoft Account", then the event is displayed as one would expect.</p>
<p>And the "Were not able to show you some of the events in this time range." message
<strong>doesn't</strong> appear at the top of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however I choose a GMail account (As I do, so that my events will sync with GMail on my phone) when creating the new event, the new event appears for an instant on December 5th and then disappears from the MS Calendar app.</p>
<p>And then the "Were not able to show you some of the events in this time range." message appears at the top of the MS Calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new event is indeed scheduled cuz if I go into GMail, I can "see" the newly scheduled event.</p>
<p>It just doesn't appear on the MS Calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, in <strong>my</strong> case, the issue has still not been "fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I need to say that I still have version 1607 installed on my Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe you have the new Creators update ?</p>
<p>I don't have that yet.</p>

<p>You can do that with your existing Windows 8.1 too.</p>
<p>It's just an update &amp; install thing, and you can switch to english (or any other supported display language).</p>

            <p>Well, you're not alone. I have the exact same annoying behavior. Switching from Metro-app back to desktop is only possible using the start-button on my keyboard. Charms bar is also gone, so upper-left en upper-right corner are useless as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a restart does solve the problem for a few hours, and then it suddenly disappears again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really hope this gets fixed soon!</p>

    <title>Audiodg.exe causing video, and other, problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> draky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audiodg.exe causing video, and other, problems</h2>
                    
<p>I originally posted the problem I was having in this thread: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/39ff6928-f766-44d0-ba69-7ae796b760e3/ and followed all the recommended solutions. Everything seemed to work fine after that,
 but for a few weeks now the problems have persisted and I'm entirely positive that audiodg.exe is causing the issue. I can be watching some video with it showing 0% CPU usage, but the instant it jumps to 1% or higher, video becomes very jumpy while audio continues
 on as normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I'm watching a DVD through windows media center with task manager open. The DVD plays just fine, with video and audio running smoothly. I have task manager set to show the processes taking up the greatest CPU% on the top of the list, and have audiodg.exe
 highlighted so that it's easy to see. As soon as I see the blue or gray bar show up at 1% or higher, the frame rate for windows media center drops to next to nothing and the computer as a whole slows down. When I kill the process, everything works as it should
 with the exception that sound doesn't exist. This isn't exclusive to the DVD or windows media center, as I've had the same issue while watching videos on YouTube or Hulu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done some searching around and it seems like this is a common issue with Vista and Windows 7 after some unspecified update. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a working solution and my audio drivers are correct and up to date. I don't recall
 everything I've tried, but I'm willing to try anything and everything to find a fix for this.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi Draky,</strong><br />
audiodg.exe [Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation] file hosts the audio engine for Vista and Window s 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span>All the DSP [Digital Signal Processing] and audio processing is performed within this file. Vendors are able to install their own DSP and audio effects into the audio pipeline,
 which will then be processed by audiodg.exe</span></p>
<p><span>In order to fix the high CPU usage, disable the audio enhancements processed by the audiodg.exe file. To disable the audio enhancements, use the following steps:<br />
a. Right-click the speaker icon in the lower right corner.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select Playback Devices from the menu. A list of devices should appear on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Double-click the device that has a green checkmark. The properties windows for that device should open.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click the Enhancements tab at the top.</span></p>
<p><span>e. From the list of enhancements, uncheck all of them, or click the Disable all enhancements checkbox.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click the OK button to save your changes and close the window.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Click OK to close the Playback Devices window.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if it makes a difference.</span></p>

I has only just starting doing this in the last month. <br />

I'm also 100% positive its the audiodg.exe.&nbsp; and I've also tried turning the enhancements off.

<p>None of the solutions worked. Now the only way is reinstalling Windows. Is there any other solution other than reinstalling Windows?</p>
<p>I forgot to mention this earlier but this problem started on a day of December. Just stopped working suddenly. But after a few days when I opened windows updates I saw it was showing "2 additional updates and 15 important updates available" and I was able
 to proceed to install the updates. But then I mistakenly clicked "Check for updates" option. From then the updates check has never been successful. I use a tuning software to improve my computer speed that includes stopping or disabling some Windows services.
 I even checked that to see if Windows Update was present in the list but it wasn't there. I manually opened the services list and started and restarted Windows Update service but still no effect. I'm missing on the latest updates.&nbsp;</p>

            Mine has started working again. Might be good news for everyone with this issue. Just change the update settings to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them" and reboot and wait your computer to settle down after reboot.
 It might work. In this way you don't even need to manually search for updates. Your PC will do that for you and whenever you open Windows Update you'll always see your updates ready to be installed.

<h2>            ERROR_SXS_ASSEMBLY_MISSING&#40;0x80073701&#41; -- WINDOWS SP1 INSTALL</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried many times to install SP1 but with no success. I installed it through Win Update and got ERROR 80073701. I then installed it from MS Download Center but I have the same result.</p>
<p>I then tried in Safe Mode but I got the same result. I then ran the sfc /scannow command and it said it had fixed some errors. I restarted the PC and tried again but I got the same result. I disabled Norton Anti-Virus and Firewall but still no success. I
 don't the CD for Windows as I bought the PC with Win 7 Professional. I have tried all the suggestions I could find but nothing has worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I has opened cbs.log and all the other files there but they are so long that I don't think you will be bothered to read them but if you want me to post it just ask.</p>
<p>Also is SP1 important and is it crucial for my system. I have another PC with Win 7 Ultimate and it worked fine so any help would be really appreciated</p>
<p>I am using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Professional 32bit</li></ul>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>1. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See...</p>

<p>2. What's the full name of your installed&nbsp;Norton application&nbsp;(e.g., Norton Security&nbsp;Suite; Norton 360)&nbsp;and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) might be installed?</p>
<p>3. Has <em>any other</em>&nbsp;Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2532531, KB2555917, KB2507938; <br />

The manufacturer is <em>required</em> to provide a way to reinstall Windows. If the computer didn't come with a set of discs, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you would use to do a clean install of Windows.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions (and only those questions)&nbsp;by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Does the computer belong to you or your school (or perhaps your local council)?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;When (approx. date) did you purchase (or take possession of) the computer?</p>

<p>• Free unlimited installation and compatibility support is available for issues related to Windows 7 Service Packs. Availability of chat, phone or e-mail support differs depending on your geographic location. Some issues may require more advanced support

<p>• Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)&nbsp;does not include any additional security fixes. While SP1 is currently an Optional (but Recommended) update, there will come a point in the not-too-distant future when SP1
<em>must be installed</em> in order to continue receiving further Windows Updates.</p>
<p>• If it's the full version of <a href="http://www.parentalcontrol.netintelligence.com/features.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Netintelligence Home Edition</strong></a>, the suite includes an anti-virus application as well as an anti-spyware application so you probably do NOT want any others (e.g., Norton 360) installed
<em>at the same time</em>.</p>
<p>The suite also includes "Web Site Blocking &amp; Filtering" which <em>may</em> not be (entirely) compatible with the similar&nbsp;"protections"&nbsp;included in IE9 by default.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>A1.</strong> Chances are Netintelligence is configured such that you <em>
must</em> use Internet Explorer for all browsing. (Otherwise this could be a symptom of a "hijackware" infection.)</p>
<p><strong>A2. </strong>Then Norton 360&nbsp;should <em>not</em> be installed: Only one (1) anti-virus application should be installed &amp; loading at boot.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. If a Step says to reboot, reboot.]</strong></p>
<p>1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp; 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span></p>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall all Norton software (including&nbsp;<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any&nbsp;
<strong>Norton Add-ons)</strong> via <strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or&nbsp;
<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt;&nbsp;Make&nbsp;<em>certain</em> that&nbsp;the Windows Firewall is enabled&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;upon rebooting. See
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a></p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>[<em>The remaining steps below will "undo" other unwanted changes Norton 360 &amp; Chrome may have made to your computer.</em>]</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Download/run the appropriate scripts by my colleague,&nbsp;IE MVP Kai Schätzl:&nbsp;<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en</a></p>
<p>Tip: The file named&nbsp;<strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the&nbsp;scripts below.</p>
<p>7a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then&nbsp;right-click on&nbsp;the script named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>7b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then&nbsp;right-click on&nbsp;the script named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>, then reboot.</p>
<p>8. Re-assert <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong><em>&lt;=important!</em></strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</a> then reboot. </p>
<p>9. Open Internet Explorer (32-bit only!) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049</a> [ignore the title, etc.] &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>10. Reset IE Advanced settings&nbsp;per <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>11. IMPORTANT - DON'T SKIP THIS STEP! =&gt; Open Internet Explorer (32-bit only) to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> [ignore any DOES NOT APPLY warnings] &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT
<em>and then</em> AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>12. Reboot one last time then&nbsp;test by running a manual check for updates &amp; seeing if SP1 will install now:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date</a></p>
<p>13. Reply to this post with a status report &amp; tell me if SP1 successfully installed. =&gt;
<em>If it didn't</em>, please confirm that KB2535<u>512</u> (not KB2544<u>521</u>) is listed in
<strong>View installed updates</strong>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>COMMENT:</strong> Do <em>not</em> (re)install Norton 360 or any other anti-virus application or security suite unless &amp; until
<strong>Netintelligence Home Edition</strong> has been successfully uninstalled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not? Your computer should NEVER be connected to the internet without a fully-functional &amp; fully-updated&nbsp;anti-virus application installed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <em>should have</em> (re)installed Norton 360 or install&nbsp;another anti-virus application after you uninstalled Netintelligence Home Edition.</p>
<p>At this point, I can only offer two options:</p>
<p><strong>OPTION 1:</strong> Free unlimited installation and compatibility support is available for issues related to Windows 7 Service Packs. Availability of chat, phone or e-mail support differs depending on your geographic location. Some issues may require
 more advanced support for which there may be a charge: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?&amp;gprid=14496&amp;&amp;st=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?&amp;gprid=14496&amp;&amp;st=1</a></p>
<p><strong>OPTION&nbsp; 2:</strong> Considering the fact that you had the Netintelligence suite&nbsp;<em>and</em> Norton 360 installed &amp; loading at boot (and specially considering the Chrome "access denied" issue), you may seeing the effects of a hijackware infection.&nbsp;

<p>Then see the (my) ANSWER post in this thread and follow those instructions (<em>to-the-letter and
<u>in order</u>!</em> ) to return your computer to a secure &amp; functional state: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc95f2f0-7968-4bd0-8de5-70b83db31fa6">

<p>Note: If a set of discs did not come with the computer, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you would use to perform the clean install (AKA destructive recovery).</p>
<p><strong>Note: The computer should not be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already compromised.</strong></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4, 16gbRam, 256GB hard drive, windows 10. I bought it because it said it could be a desktop replacement. I tried to install iTunes. I was able to download it, but the system won't let me install. I get the message 'this app can't run

<h2>            Windows 10 update stuck at &#39;&#39;Downloading 100&#37;&#39;&#39; for more than 6 hours, Please Help&#33;</h2>
                    Hello guys so I had my pc fixed (new hard) and when I came home I installed windows 10 after that I updated the drivers, installed my games and apps also disabled a lot of settings that I don't need and went on to see if there was any windows update. I
 checked and there was a couple of them. After almost all of them downloaded 1 of them remained stuck at Downloading 100%. It's been like that for more than 6 hours. I've tried restarting my pc, using the windows troubleshoot tool and some things on command
 prompt that I found on the site and still nothing. I really don't want to reinstall windows 10 again cause it takes some time but if there is no solution I think I will have to. It's not the first time this happened but last time I restarted my pc and it worked.
 Please tell me there is a solution. I am also going to post a screenshot. Thanks!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b697c202-9b90-4942-8a74-cbf064900832?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b697c202-9b90-4942-8a74-cbf064900832?upload=true" /></a>

<p>I went through this EXACT same problem a year ago when I went from an older 27" Sony Trinitron Vega HD CRTV to a brand new flat screen HDTV.&nbsp;A lot has to do with the televisions refresh rate. Bottom line, its your tv. Your tv only has "50 Clear Motion Rate"
 which is only 50 hz. I started with a very cheap HDTV and worked my way up to much more expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried 5 tvs in 30 days.&nbsp; I ended up buying 5 different tvs until I found a tv that resolved the jagged issues. Started with a 32" Toshiba, then&nbsp;32" LG, then
 32" sony bravia 60hz, then 32" Samsung 120hz, then finally a 40" Sony bravia 240hz!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To resolve the issue I would recommend a tv with 120hz or 240hz and you will see a massive improvement in quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an example, the tv I finally purchased was a
<span>Sony</span> <span>BRAVIA</span> KDL-40EX720 40" 3D LED-LCD TV 120hz 240hz motionflow.&nbsp; Notice the 240hz motionflow?&nbsp; Makes a massive difference in jagged lines and motion blur that games and movies usually create.&nbsp;
 The good news is you usually have at least 30 days to return electronics for a full refund to put toward another tv.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

[/quote]I used to but top of the range TV's and some were good some were bad, i recently have started buying a cheap brand called Techwood and have found them to be as good as most of the top brands, sure they are not better, but i have found they are not worse
 either, it's simply down to finding the right TV regardless of make or price.<br />
<br />
My current TV's don't have jaggies and only run at 60hz, a good quality cable can also makes a huge difference...

<p>Thats why I purchased 5 different tvs until I found the one that worked the best for me.&nbsp;For really picky people like myself,&nbsp;refresh rate is the most important to avoid motion blur and reduce jaggies. &nbsp;If you can find a tv with at least 120hz or 240hz you
 should be VERY happy with the results. Much much better than 60hz tvs. &nbsp;&nbsp;I even took my 360 to the store and tried plasmas, LED, LCD, I tried everything. Spent 30 straight days of trial and error. &nbsp;The Sony Bravia was the best tv out there for me. Even better
 than plasmas and better than Samsung.&nbsp; The op sounds like he is just as picky as I am so again, try different tvs and try some with 120hz and 240hz.&nbsp; I highly recommend the Sony Bravia.&nbsp; I know others on this site also love that tv.</p>

[/quote]The one thing i will say about my current TV's is they do have a very very slight Motion Blur, but they don't have jaggies and the contrast ratio is excellent (especially when NOT run in Game Mode), when in Game Mode the Motion Blur is gone, but the
 contrast ratio does not seem as good, but since they were about 40% the price of an equivalent branded make, i'm more than happy with them, and i'm fussy too!

<p>Yup the motion blur is because of the 60hz refresh rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you bump to 120hz and 240hz refresh rate&nbsp;the difference is night and day.&nbsp; Luckily I have 2 360s at home so I was able to set up 2 tvs side by side with 2 360s and the same 2 games and run an
 insane amount of tests on each tv side by side.&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion blur was instantly resolved when I jumped to 120hz tvs and 240hz tvs. It also reduced jaggies.&nbsp; Some games just naturally have jaggies that cant be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But 120hz and 240hz really work magic
 removing as many of these as possible. I am just&nbsp; here to help and prevent others from dealing with the massive frustration that I went through last year.&nbsp; That month seriously sucked.&nbsp; BUt now I have an epic tv and love it. :)&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing about the Sony
 out of all the other tvs I tried was how amazing it looked right out of the box even before calibrating the tv.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sony Bravia right out of the box looks amazing.</p>

<p>I agree that in general the higher the refresh rate the better, but it depends on just how much you are willing to pay for a TV, as i said i used to spend an awaful lot of money on top spec TV's (i had 5 Samsungs in 3 years), but i have come to realise that
 lesser known brands (particularly German brands) can be as good as well known brands of TV's.</p>
<br />
<br />
Cables and cables sockets are as important as refresh rates in my opinion...

<p>I went from 60hz to 240hz and I couldn't imagine going back. I don't notice the jaggy lines. 120hz and up are ideal for gaming. Also, plasma doesn't get motion blur like LCD tv's or at least not as much.

<p>Interesting I've never had this problem, but when I bought my TV the guy must have known his stuff because I said it was going to be used for gaming more then anything else and he put me onto one that runs 120hz.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm going to try and remember this as I've seen people with similar problems.</p>
