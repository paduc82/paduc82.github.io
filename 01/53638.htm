<h2>            Lumia 930 with Windows 10 - can&#39;t connect to PC</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading my Lumia 930 recently to version 1511 and OS build 10.0.14295.1000, it will no longer connect to my PC. Here's the scenario:</p>
<p>1. Connect phone to PC via working USB cable (I've tried several)</p>
<p>2. Phone starts to charge</p>
<p>3. PC does not recognise that a device is connected (I've tried three PCs, two running Windows 10 and one Windows 8.1).</p>
<p>It worked as expected on earlier builds of Windows 10. </p>
<p>Am I the only one with this issue?</p>

            <p>Hello Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to try performing a Hard Reset once to see if it makes any difference in this situation. Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and
 the phone will be restored to its factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to reset your phone, you can back up apps, text messages, and more in the cloud beforehand. To learn more about how this works, see

</li><li>
<p>Select <span>System</span> &gt; <span>About</span> &gt; <span>Reset your phone</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, select
<span>Yes</span>, and then select <span>Yes</span> again. It might take a little while for the process to complete.
</p>
</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. I've followed the steps as described (twice), and, unfortunately, the behaviour has also not changed. I ended up with the same build number both times. The first time, I let the install process reuse settings from previous build;
 the second time, I did it clean. </p>
<p>Do you have any other ideas? </p>
<p>I also have another problem now. Cortana won't talk to me, as there are errors downloading Speech language and Keyboard--both are English (Australia). This is actually a much more inconvenient issue than the original one. :(</p>
<p>Thanks, Sam</p>

    <title>Unwanted game keeps interrupting my other game. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unwanted game keeps interrupting my other game.</h2>
                    I play a lot of Microsoft Klondike Solitaire.&nbsp; Have never had a problem until recently. All of a sudden in the middle of the game or when I click to play a new game of solitaire, my screen flashes to some kids game called 'Paradise Island 2' &amp; I have to
 wait until it's done playing it's example to be able to play my solitaire.&nbsp; I even tried to click on 'get game-free' but it comes up saying that the game doesn't work on my device (b/c I don't have windows 10 which it requires &amp; I have no desire to get).&nbsp;
 I uninstalled my Microsoft Solitaire Collection and re-installed it to no avail, it's still there &amp; in fact shows up more than before.&nbsp; Is there ANY way to stop this from coming on my comp? Thank You.

            Hi Pat.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Check in Microsoft Store Settings  (elipsis ... icon)  that this other game is not listed under Downloads and Updates, Purchased or My Library, and if so click to remove it.  
<br />
<br />Check also at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features it isn't there, if so uninstall. 
<br />
<br />If this is a problem with Klondike solitaire, you can Reset it in the same place under Advanced Options when you click on the game.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, I found the store &amp; the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. I was going to just uninstall the one I have &amp; re-install from the store, I was in store but saw nowhere to uninstall-I don't know what-where 'settings/apps' are--or advanced options--Sorry.&nbsp;
 But in the store it says on the game to choose MSC that it's already installed. How can I uninstall it? Mind you I tried to figure out your suggestions, but I'm really not that tech savvy, soooo.........<br />

<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow.&nbsp; It finishes on an error which does not make me happy, but I am not confident that it has anything to do with the main problem.&nbsp; From the end of the CBS log:</p>

</p><p>The user -500 is the built-in Administrator, but other users are similarly affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a nose around Component Services/Computers/My Computer/Properties/COM Security.&nbsp; Access Permissions has these three users configured: SELF, SYSTEM, Administrators;&nbsp; Launch these three: SYSTEM,Administrators,INTERACTIVE.&nbsp; Problem is, I cannot find on
 the web any example of what it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The above is the short story.&nbsp; The longer story is that this is actually the SECOND time this happens.&nbsp; First time round, I thought I had messed something up, decided the best recovery would be to downgrad back to Win7 and re-do the Win10 upgrade.&nbsp; It is
 only when it happened again that I cottoned on to the fact that it wasn't me, it was the Windows Update that did it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it is worth, the packages installed over night were: KB3163018 KB3149135 KB3152599 KB3106246&nbsp; I could of course roll back the individual packages until the problem hopefully disappears.&nbsp; It seems however a pointless course of action since come the
 next update cycle, the package (and problem, I'd guess) will only reappear.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; I worked through the links.&nbsp; There are no further Updates at this moment.&nbsp; The troubleshooter looks promising.&nbsp; It discovers a problem.&nbsp; Alas, it is unable to fix it.&nbsp; Here goes:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no 3rd party virus installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The -500 local administrator account is new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am slightly concerned that you are focusing too much on Cortana and Start - there is a WHOLE SLEW of DCOM error messages in the Event Log (I originally quoted "App").&nbsp; The fundamental problem appears to be with the DCOM sub-system.&nbsp; The malfunctioning
 of Cortana and Start are simply the most noticeable manifestations of the wider problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not reboot after the Troubleshooter - there was no indication that I should.&nbsp; (It said that it had failed to fix the problem.)&nbsp; I am currently traveling.&nbsp; I can try another reboot when I get home on Friday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The -500 account is the built-in Administrator account which I created with the command "net user administrator /active:yes".&nbsp; It has the same problems as all the other user accounts - no Cortana, no Start.&nbsp; The machine is connected to a home network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked the Ethernet settings under Settings.&nbsp; The original Homegroup does not appear to have ported from Win7.&nbsp; "Network 3" is identified as a "Private network" connected via "Local Area Connection".&nbsp; For what it is worth, my browser can get to the
 Internet ok; I can see our printer; and the machine runs our music server which is streaming music happily to our various network streamers - that is, I seem to experience no network problems.<br />
</p>
<p>I performed a "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth".&nbsp; It aborted with </p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 0x800f081f<br />
The source files could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I cannot attach the DISM log to this post, so I will quote what seems relevant to me:</p>

</p><p>Following the link to https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825020.aspx, it suggest that some media might be required. &nbsp; However, it also suggests that Windows Update is the default media source, and I have certainly not done anything to stop that
 (consciously).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I downloaded the Windows 10 Update on to a memory stick before upgrading the machine, but the only WIM file on there is called sources/boot.wim.</p>

            <p>Reading through this link, the pictures look awfully familiar.&nbsp; Basically, it seems to me that I am re-installing Win10 in much the same manner as when I upgraded from Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two observations:</p>
<p>1&nbsp; If I did this now, would I still be able to downgrade to Win7, the last system that actually worked properly?</p>
<p>2&nbsp; If you want to reread this thread, there was actually NOTHING WRONG following the upgrade from Win7 to Win10.&nbsp; it all seemed to work.&nbsp; The problems appeared after the system performed the first Automatic Update.&nbsp; Now, I suspect that when I re-run the
 install, the process will effectively delete those offending updates and give me a clean Win10.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Next it will notice that the clean Win10 is not up to date, and it will go an update itself.&nbsp; After which I am back to where I am now.&nbsp; You can see from
 my first post that I have been there before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea why I see those DISM error messages?&nbsp; Do you have any idea how to troubleshoot the DCOM errors in my log file?&nbsp; I do not get the sense that we are getting to the bottom of the underlying problem here, something that was caused by installing
 the updates mentioned in my first post.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Ok, I managed to fix the DISM problems by doing the following:</p>
<p>1&nbsp; I downloaded the "Windows 10" ISO image in "English" for "x64" from here</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench</p>
<p>It may well have been unnecessary because I realize that the upgrade contained a sources/install.esd and what DISM needed was some install.wim.&nbsp; I understand the two are somehow equivalent, but I do not understand how.
</p>
<p>2&nbsp; I executed </p>
<p>dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:M:\ISO\sources\install.wim:1 /limitacess</p>
<p>I have no real idea what some of these parameters mean but it went away, did its thing and claimed "success".&nbsp; Jolly good.</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Afterwards, I ran</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>It reported errors but claimed to have repaired them (*).&nbsp; Good.</p>
<p>4&nbsp; I rebooted.</p>
<p>5&nbsp; I logged back in as Administrator and ALL UNCHANGED.&nbsp; Looking at the Event Log, I still get dozens of messages from the Distributed DCOM system, all of the 10010 variety "... did not register with DCOM within the required timeout."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what the cause for these errors is.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(*)&nbsp; The only thing sfc appears to have accomplished it to restore opencl.dll ;)</p>

<h2>            CHKDSK taking very long time</h2>
                    
<p>I have a SATA drive system that every time it reboots runs chkdsk and it seems to run fine with no errors, but then the system seems to reboot and the screen never beomes active. The computer seems to be running, peripherals light up, but the screen never
 comes on and the keyboard never syncs (it is a bluetooth). I have left it run now for 1 day thinking it was doing something, but nothing has changed. Previously I let this happen and eventually hard powered off the computer and when it reboots I stop the CHKDSK
 and the computer boots fine. Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Problems After Surface RT Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsurfrt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems After Surface RT Reset</h2>
                    <p>I did a reset on my surface rt after many apps began starting really slow, would crash soon after starting and websites wouldn't fully load (long running scripts).&nbsp; After the reset (from the downloadable image), I did a firmware update and then there were
 only like 59 additional updates that installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my problems:</p>
<p>Original Windows 8 Store.&nbsp; Can't install any apps (get a message that my connection is too slow.... which it is not)</p>
<p>Original SkyDrive...not updated to OneDrive</p>
<p>Windows continuously loops checking for additional updates (never stops checking... but never finds anything to install.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I S.O.L.? or is there someway I can fully update my Surface RT 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>If your volume down button is not working it is a hardware problem with the volume buttons.&nbsp; Does you volume control still work with the&nbsp;Settings charm, Desktop volume settings and Surface keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are stuck in checking for updates it is because the sequence of installing the updates and msu files is wrong that you gave on May 28.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Start over</p>
<p>I copy it and put it here.</p>
<p>You can only hide the Office updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Reset your RT from within Windows.&nbsp; Reset, not refresh.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/refresh-or-reset-surface-rt#within" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/refresh-or-reset-surface-rt#within</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set up your surface and head to Windows update in the control panel<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Search for updates, after 30m-1h you will see a firmware update,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On all update results you can hide Office updates and install them later, but install everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>&nbsp; After your surface rt restarted go ahead and search again for updates from the control panel<br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong>&nbsp;Again you will see a package of updates, this update includes the Windows RT 8.1 Update 1 update (kb2919355).<br />
<strong>Step 6:</strong> When you finished installing the updates and your surface rebooted again, go to “installed updates” and check if kb2919355 is installed.<br />
<strong>Step 7:</strong> If no, search for updates again. kb2919355 has to be installed</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn off your Wifi</span>, reboot and install kb3173424, reboot<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 14:</strong> Install kb3172614, reboot<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 16:</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn on your Wifi</span>, searching for updates and after 10+/- minutes you will see over 200, install</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn off Wi-Fi and </span>install KB3097667
</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, right-click on Taskbar &gt; Properties, Start Menu. <span>
&nbsp;</span>Check the box, Use the Start Menu instead of the Start Screen for no more metro screen.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Install all other updates found.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When Windows updates are all done and Update 3 is installed go back and restore hidden updates and install the Office Updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After installing each package of updates and the Windows Update page shows ‘Restart Now’,
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>After it restarts let the RT process the updates. When the disk usage finally goes down to zero you can go to the next step. To check disk usage, right clock the taskbar and select ‘task manager’, then the ‘performance’ tab.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 displaying English in gibberish - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david gabay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 displaying English in gibberish</h2>
                    Some of my applications which used to work in the past are now displaying some English text in complete gibberish, I've done a little research and found out the problem was with the creators update. The only solution is to change the region for Unicode
 characters to English, but then I cannot type in Hebrew in those applications, which is very important to me since Hebrew is my main language. Is there any way to fix it and be able to use English and Hebrew again?

            I'm not quite sure I understand your question. But I'll take a shot.

The File history feature is used to backup your personal data files, like DOCX, PDF, XLSX etc to an external drive.  It keeps versions and is intended to allow you to recover older versions of files that have become corrupted or have been deleted accidentally.

An Image copy backup is a "Snapshot" of your whole drive, typically taken at a point in time the drive is in a known state, good or bad. It is intended for "disaster" recovery. Restoring from an image copy means that you do not have to re-install Windows and all of your applications. Some image copy backup software allows you to extract individual files, but that is a feature you have to look for.

Does that answer your question?

            If you use File History be sure to have another backup method, like to the cloud using Google Drive which has a new Backup feature that gives you 15gb free and lets you designate the User folders you want sync'd in real time, and periodically drag your User folders to an external or another hard drive.   

Keep a System Image backup using a flexible 3rd party app like free Macrium http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders
https://reflect.macrium.com/webtutorial/How_to_create_a_disk_image.asp

If WIndows ever becomes irreparable boot the Rescue media to reimage C with the stored image:  http://reflect.macrium.com/help/v5/how_to/rescue/rescue_a_system_with_the_windows_pe_environment.htm

Finally be sure to have a great install of Windows 10 that's worth backing up.  YOu only need to do it once.   This link compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/

<p>Thanks for help but&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1, Macrium is no longer free</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me restate question. I apologize for not being clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed that there is a "system&nbsp; image" icon on file history page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asking for clarification as 1. its purpose, 2. reliability</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had trouble with file history restore after I replaced a failed hard drive. I tries to restore my diligently save files. It took myself and Microsoft 5-6 tried to get the files restore.&nbsp; Even then there were multiple copies of same files. Still clearing
 up mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 700G data back up, so suggested sites are not large enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary, I was asking if can I use system image in file history to restore lost or saved files all at one time by using system image vs file restore?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free version of Macrium Reflect</a>. In addition, retail hard drives typically come with image backup software as well as full instructions on how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows' own System Image Backup utility will make a backup image, but you'll have to use a recovery disk or restore Windows first before you can restore the image. And FWIW, System Image Backup is being deprecated (tech talk for 'on the way out'). You would
 be better served by using a third-party image backup utility, as others have suggested, whether that is the software that comes with your new hard drive, the free version of Macrium Reflect, or whatever other image backup program you choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third-party software will make a bootable image of your C: drive, so all you have to do is restore that image to the new hard drive and you're back to work like nothing happened.</p>

            Hi Chrissabei
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Go to the folder - C:\Users\.......Startup (Please write the complete path as per your error message)
<br />Open Notepad &gt; Put following in this Notepad file
<br />WScript.Quit 
<br />Save this file as supercpuchecker.vbs in this folder (Make sure that you have selected All files in Save as type: box while saving otherwise it will append .txt at the end which you will have to remove)
<br />Reboot your PC
<br />The error will go away

<p>Windows Script Host is an important part of Windows. You're seeing that message because your computer either is currently or was previously infected with SuperCPUChecker malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no expert at removing malware because, believe it or not, I have never been infected myself. However, a first step often recommended in this forum is to scan your computer with the&nbsp;<em>free</em> version of the popular and reliable Malwarebytes, which

            Hi Chris.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First of all turn off all Startup freeloaders that should not be starting with WIndows in the first place, following Step 4 in this tutorial:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if it continues browse to the location in the error to delete the file or folder of that name, after unhiding System files in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; enable Show Hidden Files, approve security box, Apply, Save.   
<br />
<br />If any problem deleting the file then first take ownership using this handy shortcut:
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Chrissabei 
<br />
<br />The solution is to basically recreate that file and put an exit script into it 
<br />
<br />1
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items
<br />
<br />In the address bar paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />shell:startup
<br />
<br />Right click in that folder and choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Put this text in that file: 
<br />
<br />Wscript.Quit 
<br />
<br />Then click File - Save As 
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the save as dialog, set save as type to *.* 
<br />
<br />Save the files as supercpuchecker..vbs 
<br />
<br />Note you must enter the vbs file extension yourself 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />2
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />After the scan Restart your PC, you can then uninstall MalwareBytes . .

            Hi Chrissabei
<br />
<br />There is an entry in your Windows Startup process trying to load that file, it needs to be removed . . .
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Look for any entry listing Stream.txt or Autoit, on the initial list or on the Logon Tab, then untick any you find . . .

            Do you have any non-essential devices attached to the computer such as an external hard disk? If so disconnect them. If you have more than one internal hard disks attached, try disconnecting all except the one you plan on installing Windows 7 on.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are able to connect&nbsp;to the internet using the Ethernet but cannot connect to Wi-Fi and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the effort made towards trying to resolve the issue. Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>When was the last time you were able to connect to Wi-Fi?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Did you recently upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>This could be due to missing/corrupted network adapter. Let's try the following methods and check if the issues still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Install any pending Windows update available</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to install any pending Windows update (including Option updates)&nbsp;as there could be an update related to network adapter which may help you connect to Wi-Fi.</p>
To check for updates
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, tapping or clicking <span>Change PC settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking
<span>Update and recovery</span>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Check now</span>, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your PC.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If updates are found, tap or click <span>Install updates</span>.
</p>
<p>Read and accept the license terms, and then tap or click <span>
Finish</span> if the update requires it. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Install the latest network adapter from the computer manufacturer's support website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to: <span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-network-adapter-problems#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I fix network adapter problems?</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>A tool to remove Internet history info, <br />
cookies, temp files, auto complete and other junk.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note that when CCleaner is first installed most if not all the options <br />
are checked which is far too aggressive. So I recommend unchecking <br />
all the items listed in ‘Applications’ tab and in the 'Windows' tab <br />
selectively place a check mark for only those options that are of some <br />
value in increasing the amount of free space on your PC.</p>
<p>The 'Analyze' button allows you preview (without actually deleting)<br />
what and how much hard drive space you will get back.</p>
<p>Also available is customization, see Options/Custom to add any <br />
other/additional folders you want files deleted from.</p>

 then move only what is in the Libraries.</p>
<p>Do&nbsp; <strong>not</strong> move system files.</p>
<p>Do&nbsp; <strong>not</strong> move the program files that use the personal data files (for example, Word, iTunes, Photoshop).</p>
<p>The golden rule here is - if you are not 100% sure, do&nbsp; <strong>not</strong> move the file or you risk your system not booting, becoming unstable or programs not running.</p>

Locate the disk and insert it in the installation drive and try updates again.<br />

<h2>            deterministic network enhance miniport not working</h2>
                    all of my WAN miniport and virtual miniports are not working.&nbsp; I've tried to delete and cannot do it.&nbsp; Tried to update drivers and cannot do it either.
<br />
<br />
can you tell me how I can resolve this?&nbsp; I read one forum that said to manually change the driver to a MAC bridge miniport and then delete then scan for new hardware and it will come back and reinstall the correct drivers.&nbsp; I did that on the WAN Miniport (IP)
 but it didn't come back at all.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hola XxEvilJGLxX,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Se está impidiendo su depósito debido a un desajuste entre la Cuenta de Recompensas de España que registró y su región de Cuenta de Microsoft de México. Dado que su Cuenta de Recompensas es una entidad separada de su Cuenta de Microsoft, la migración de su región de Cuenta de Microsoft no cambiará también su región de la Cuenta de Recompensas. Por lo tanto, cuando su cuenta de recompensas intenta un depósito en una moneda regional, no se puede completar cuando su cuenta de Microsoft es de una moneda diferente.</p><p><br />Sin embargo, se puede corregir este problema dirigiéndose a la página de Microsoft Commerce en (https://commerce.microsoft.com) para actualizar su cuenta de Microsoft para que coincida con su ubicación de Xbox Live Rewards. Otra opción si desea continuar con Recompensas en su región actual de Xbox Live es optar por salir del programa en (https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/), esperar 48 horas y luego volver a firmar la copia de seguridad, lo que puede También tomar 48 horas.

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Now see whether this keyboard is there somewhere (most probably it should be under Keyboards). If not, look into other entries as well. 
<br />Once you find it, right click on it &gt; Uninstall driver &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            skype for business crashes when using connected camera</h2>
                    I'm using Skype for Business in Office 2016. &nbsp;Every time I try to access a connected camera it crashes. &nbsp;I've tried several camera. &nbsp;It is a recent change, I've been using Skype for Business and this particular camera for over a year. &nbsp;I thought perhaps
 something went wrong with the camera, so I tried a few others with the same results. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

            Jacoblia,<br />This is an update conflict, did you get a blue screen?  Usually this means that something within the update has either installed incorrectly or has a driver issue.  Is everything working correctly?  I'd recommend running a checkdisk.  If you aren't sure what that it is I can walk you thru it.<br /><br />Waiting for your reply <br />Yomi Thomas

            Hi Jacob, did you get a blue screen at any point when this event happened?
<br />
<br />If not, then I would not worry too much about this, Errors and events are constantly happening in Windows and Windows is designed to recover from these automatically without any user intervention . . .
<br />
<br />If you did get a blue screen, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>
