<h2>            BSOD caused by VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a few BSODs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One by Non Paged...something I don't remember properly.</p>
<p>One by DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.</p>
<p>One was caused by atikmdag.sys file/driver.</p>
<p>And this is the 3rd one.</p>
<p>I am having AMD 530 Radeon.</p>
<p>I did try uninstalling the driver &amp; then using the AMD's auto detect driver install tool, reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>However issues don't seem to end.</p>

    <title>Explorer.exe not responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrkh8er20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe not responding</h2>
                    Okay, this is an issue I see all over the place, and each person seems to have found a different solution to it - none of which work for me.<br />
<br />
Explorer.exe stops responding within minutes of booting up my computer. This just started happening yesterday, seemingly out of nowhere (there's got to be some cause, but I can't imagine what it could be, because my computer was working fine the night before
 and I didn't do anything out of the ordinary). Avast virus scans come up clean, and there weren't any problems before I booted up my computer yesterday morning only to encounter a black screen with everything except my cursor frozen.<br />
<br />
I recently overhauled most of my hardware (new CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, power supply), but as I mentioned, it was all working together perfectly for about a week after I got everything installed, and now explorer.exe is giving me this issue. My GPU driver
 is up to date, and I'm fairly certain my BIOS is up to date (I'll have to double check on that one). Last time I had a similar issue (years ago on another computer), I was getting bluescreens because of an explorer.exe crash that wound up being caused by a
 faulty driver for my wireless network card. This time around it's entirely possible that it's a similar driver-related issue, but I can't tell for sure.<br />
<br />
Everything works perfectly fine in Safe Mode, but when I boot up Windows normally, I can get maybe 1-5 minutes of use before explorer.exe stops responding and everything freezes (except the cursor).<br />
<br />
I've tried many of the solutions to explorer.exe problems posted here (registry edits, shell is running "explorer.exe," etc). The only solution that's done anything at all was changing the folder option to "always show icons, never thumbnails," but all that
 did was give me a couple minutes of use before explorer.exe freezes, rather than having it freeze as soon as it starts.<br />
<br />
I know I'll need to provide more info, so ask away and I'll see what I can pull up.<br />

            <p>Solved it!</p>
<p>Finally did find one solution that worked for me: I disabled all startup programs and enabled them until I found the culprit.</p>
<p>Ironically, the thing that was making my computer act like a virus was a corrupt update of Avast antivirus. Everything's working now that I've uninstalled and reinstalled Avast.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
- What are the exact hardware changes made to the computer before the issue has started?<br />
- Have you tried performing the System Restore?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try the following steps that would fix your problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to perform clean boot, then download and install the update from the following link.</p>

<p>Note: Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to put the computer back to normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: System Restore<br />
Please perform the System Restore in order to apply the previous changes before changes were done.</p>

            <p>I may have a similar problem. &nbsp;But strangely the problem is with Microsoft's Bing site. &nbsp;I used Bing.com all the time before the big W10 software update November'ish (not the original conversion to W10). I had to quit using it since it fails to load 99%
 of the time. &nbsp;The 1% it works seems to be the first time I use it. &nbsp;After that it fails to load the page. &nbsp;This occurs using Chrome and MS Edge. &nbsp;It works on my W10 tablet And a W10 netbook</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I get is <span><span>"</span></span><span>This webpage is not available ERR_CONNECTION_RESET"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think, but I'm not sure, that if I can get logged out of Bing or Microsoft then the next page load works. &nbsp;But I don't recall having consistent results after that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My workaround is to use Google.</span></p>

            <p>Using the PC I have troubles using Google's SMTP email servers and trouble getting to Microsoft's Bing.com, I tried going to the same pages that Jan has trouble with and I too cannot get to the last page. &nbsp;I tried&nbsp;Edge,&nbsp;Chrome and Firefox on the PC and they
 all failed. &nbsp;It also appeared a lot slower on the PC than the other two and the PC is a LOT more powerful. &nbsp; I tried connecting from the US. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried </p>
<p>- Using a W10 tablet and it got through fine using Edge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- A netbook running W10 and it got through fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such It does not appear to be a network or AV problem. &nbsp;There is something buggy with the PC W10 installation.</p>
<p><br />
FWIW... occasionally I cannot get to pages I request. &nbsp;In the past I thought it &nbsp;was some other problem. &nbsp;Maybe their failures are related to the other problems with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Nick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the PC is hardwired to the network. &nbsp;The other two are wireless.</p>

            <p>Hi Sachin, for your information this is how I (and Nick, see above) get the problem using Edge (but any browser will exhibit very similar results):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">a)&nbsp;<span>go to www.hl.co.uk and click on "Contact us" at the top right hand corner</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>b)&nbsp;</span><span>at this point you might get "</span>Hmm, we can't reach this page" or you might get the page of phone numbers after a long wait</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">c)&nbsp;if you do get the phone numbers, find one that has a "Send us a message" link under it and click on that link; at that point I always get a failure message</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said earlier, if I use my Android device or Windows Vista pc, then it works fine.</p>

<li>Did you try checking with the service provider?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try&nbsp;<strong>manually reset TCP/IP</strong>, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Note: </strong></span>You must be <strong>logged on to the computer as an administrator
</strong>to perform the steps. <br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + X keys</strong> and select <strong>Command prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: </li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note </strong>If you don't want to specify a directory path for the log file, run the following command instead:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset</strong> </p>

            <p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets try the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Disable or uninstall the third party anti-virus software and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state </span><strong><span>and check.</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had interesting results. &nbsp;I tried your suggestion to" <strong>manually reset TCP/IP</strong>" &nbsp;I got the same response as Jan (In addition to the others mine also had Global = OK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted:</p>
<p>- Bing.com worked. &nbsp;I did a couple searches and it worked fine</p>
<p>- I could not get to HL.CO.UK the last step to send a message</p>
<p>- If I recall correctly, I tried Bing.com after HL.CO.UK and it worked again</p>
<p>- I tried Thunderbird</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- My first message delivered via the google SMTP server</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- My second one and subsequent ones would not deliver</p>
<p>- When I tried Bing.com it fails to load with the message "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This webpage is not available &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 1)">ERR_CONNECTION_RESET</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this before where the first TB email will deliver properly and the following ones fail. &nbsp;And I've had it where the first bing search works and subsequent fail. &nbsp;Simply rebooting does not always fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, Nick</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>. &nbsp;I rebooted again without doing another manual reset as above. &nbsp;When I rebooted Chrome reload the previous tabs. &nbsp;One was a bing search and it failed. &nbsp;I closed it and created a new tab and went to Bing.com. &nbsp;It tried for a long
 time, it flashed the "this webpage not available ..." message for a split second and then loaded the page. &nbsp;I tried multiple bing searches that worked. &nbsp;I tried sending an email using Thunderbird, via the Google SMTP server, and it failed. &nbsp;In this case I
 did not even get one message through like above. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Chrome I tried bing and it works and continues to work...I take that back...I just created a new tab and it failed to open Bing.com. &nbsp;And the tab I just wrote about is no longer able to load Bing.com. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to make multiple Bing searches using Edge. But as indicated before, Edge cannot always load Bing. &nbsp;For now it seems to be working in Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE 2 &nbsp;</strong>I did another reboot and this time I did the manual reset again. &nbsp;Thunderbird failed to send via the SMTP google server on the first try. &nbsp;Bing is loading and loading on multiple tabs and can search... for now. &nbsp;And at this point
 I can get to HL.CO.UK and get through to the send a message page (couldn't before).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 3</strong> HL.CO.UK contact page now is not loading as it did before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a pattern in this I can't see it:-(</p>

    <title>Windows 10 suddenly goes to black screen with cursor, and logs out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 suddenly goes to black screen with cursor, and logs out</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer started doing this recently. It has now done it 3 times. All of a sudden all my three displays go black, with only the cursor visible. For a while (5-10 seconds) the cursor blinks on the black screen and if I had a video playing for example on
 Youtube, I could hear the video still playing, until I hear the universal device unplugged sound and the computer logs out and closes all my programs and all my unsaved work gets lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the login screen appears, I have to log in again and when I do so, my secondary display is the only screen that's working. If I move a window across the screen fast, I can see tearing. If I go to display settings from the right click menu on my desktop,
 I can only see one display in the diagram. If I click detect, it says no displays were detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple reboot after this fixes the issue, but the last time this happened I didn't even bother logging in as everything I had open would already be closed, and chose to reboot instead. To my surprise, after Windows had rebooted, it used my third display.
 It had the completely wrong resolution on it, and clearly that time the error wasn't fixed by the reboot. I logged in and thought maybe this strange issue causes me to have to log in again before rebooting. I logged in, and then rebooted again and since then
 everything has been back to normal as I'm typing this right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just yesterday updated my gpu driver thinking it might have caused this, but no, as this happened again very soon after that. Any ideas?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't run the Anniversary update yet, I'm still on Windows 10 Version 1511 (Build 10586.545).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC specs are</p>
<p>Intel core i7-3770K</p>
<p>16GB DDR3</p>
<p>GeForce GTX760 (with driver version 372.54)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is installed on an SSD.</p>

            <p>Just to clarify, my PC doesn't <strong>boot</strong> to a black screen. The black screen just appears out of nowhere while my PC is already running and has been so for at least a day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also there's really no way for me to try with those steps, as the black screen appears completely randomly and only lasts for a few seconds and then "recovering" after wreaking havoc on my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: The crash happened again, now 4th time. The moment I least expect it, it's gonna crash.</p>

    <title>Accessing an XP backup on a portable hard drive attached to a windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhoganyh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing an XP backup on a portable hard drive attached to a windows 7 computer.</h2>
                    Is there some way to view photos in an XP backup made about a year ago to a portable hard drive? The portable hard drive is now attached to a newer windows 7 desktop. I don't want to restore the backup, just view the photos and other files in it. When
 I click on the backup now I get the following error message .."windows photo viewer can't open this photo because either windows photo viewer doesn't support this file format, or you don't have the latest updates". I doubt that my updates are behind since
 my system is set for automatic updates. Hope you can help ... thanks.

            Hi Moosebowl,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To solve both the problems, use Skype for Desktop instead - <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />What you are using is Store app of Skype which doesn't offer either of things which you need. 
<br />
<br />Both versions will co-exist together and will interfere with each other. But at one time, you can run only one.
<br />
<br />If you need to disable Windows 10 Store Skype app as this might keep getting started up - 
<br />
<br />Uninstall - Windows Key+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Installing Windows 8.1 Pro in dual boot with Windows 10 in Legacy mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I have Windows 10 as the operating system on my computer. I'm using aniversary update. I'd like to do a dualboot with Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. I installed 10 in legacy mode for some reason. Now, when i try to install windows 8.1 in legacy, nothing
 happens, just Windows logo displays on the picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When I change to uefi, my hard drive isn't being recognized by BIOS. So, if i install my new Windows 10 in uefi, will I lose all my partitions, data and so on.. Is there a way to bypass UEFI and install 8.1 in legacy?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello Folks,</p>
<p>I've just reset windows 10 and now the speakers on my HP Desktop aren't working. Gone into device manager and got it to search for and download the drivers for&nbsp;my&nbsp;cheapo Creative A60 speakers but it came up with the message:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device"</p>
<p>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it."</p>
<p>"A device attached to the system is not functioning"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speakers were working OK before the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Config</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17761.316)</p>
<p>Office programs installed -</p>
<p>XP Professional 10.0.2627.01</p>

<p>
</p><p>Behaviour</p>
<p>Windows Updates attempts to install this - Office XP Service Pack 3 </p>
<p>But I get the following message in Windows Updates -</p>
<p>Office XP Service Pack 3 - Last failed install attempt on 21.02.2019 0x80240034</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms</p>
<p>Windows becomes unstable, crashes and the laptop becomes unusable as soon as it attempts to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My attempts to fix the problem -</p>
<p>I have tried the advice below, to stop the update installing. However, as stated in the URL, this is a temporary fix, so the update keeps returning and causing instability issues again.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window</p>
<p>I can't find a way to remove this update permanently - the update in fact doesn't exist on the Microsoft website anymore. When I click in the update, it takes me to the following website -</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=7102</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer supports Office XP. I need a fix for this because it is making the laptop unusable.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />    3-Under To stop using Microsoft Update, select the Disable Microsoft Update software and let me use Windows Update only check box.
<br />
<br />   4- Click Apply changes now, and then click Yes.

            Yes Dinael ! These steps must be done on Windows XP, not 10! 
<br />These steps will stop auto update for sofwtares and then, Office will not be updated automatically anymore.

            I understand Ramzi! But I do not have Windows XP installed on the laptop that has the problem with the Office XP SP3 updates. I have a laptop with Windows 10 installed and the problem is occurring on Windows 10. It is not possible to fix the problem on
 XP, because I don‘t have XP. So how do I fix this? See the config in my post.

            On your main post you have write XP Professional 10.0.2627.01
<br />That's why I was giving some steps for Windows XP. Sorry for that. 
<br />You need to use Microsoft Update instead of Windows update. To use Microsoft Update instead of Windows Update, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />    Visit the following Microsoft Web site:
<br />    <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate</a>
<br />    Click Start Now.
<br />    On the Review the license agreement page, click Continue.
<br />    Click Install.
<br />
<br />    Note You may not be prompted to install the Microsoft Update software if this software is already available on the computer. 
<br />
<br />After you successfully install the software, a Microsoft Update shortcut is added to the All Programs menu on the Start menu.
<br />
<br />Now open the MICROSOFT UPDATE program and disable SOFTWARE UPDATE (Keep System update)

You have two versions of Windows OS? I would like to let you know, Office XP and Office 2010 are outdated. I suggest you upgrade to Office 2016 or 2019, depending on what version of Windows you are using. Windows XP is outdated, by the way.</p>

<p>Thanks, I appreciate the time you’ve taken to help me, :-) but please note that in my original post I wrote -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OFFICE programs installed -</p>
<p>XP Professional 10.0.2627.01</p>
<p>Office Home and Student 2010.</p>
<p>14.0.1715.1000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didnt mention the XP OS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try your steps when I’m home and let you know the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point which might help with troublehsooting - I don’t actually use the XP version of office - only the 2010 version. So I guess the windows update would disappear if I removed XP Office. But I’m not sure whether Office 2010 is an upgrade from Office
 XP, and &nbsp;I don’t want to remove it without knowing whether it would affect Office 2010.</p>

<p>Hi, Please see my last reply to Ramzi for clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t want to upgrade office without first trying to fix the problem as this would cost money. The primary issue is that an outdated piece of software - XP Office - (which I don’t use) is affecting a currently supported OS, - Windows 10 - which I paid
 for and therefore need working. The problem stems fromthe fact that Microsoft no longer supports XP Office, which I don’t use.</p>
<p>But I,m nit sure if I can removed it without affecting the installation of Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ll follow Ramzi’s instructions first and report back.</p>

<p>Firstly to try to clear up some of the confused replies:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Office XP is Office 2002 and is not Windows XP.&nbsp; (Microsoft rather stupidly used this alternative name to coincide, more or less, with the release of Windows XP.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Office 2010 IS compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; See the link below for official information.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Which versions of Office work with Windows 10?</p>
<p>&nbsp; https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-versions-of-Office-work-with-Windows-10-0fc85c97-da69-466e-b2b4-54f7d7275705</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if Office 2010 had been installed as an upgrade it would have replaced the Office XP version rather than being installed in addition to it.&nbsp; It
<em>should</em> be safe to uninstall the XP/2002 software which id definitely not compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp;

<h2>            No USB 2.0</h2>
                    <p>Hi - a few days ago my PC stopped due to a worn out fan - so, I got myself a new fan and installed it;</p>
<p>to do so I had to unplug all devices whlist opening the case....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When switching on the PC there were a few conflicts shown. I did:</p>
<p>- unplug everything except mouse/keyboard&nbsp;</p>
<p>- deleted all USB drivers (and hoped Win would install the required drivers automatically + the mainboard CD + win 7 CD)</p>
<p>- run USB oblivion</p>
<p>
</p><p>- now I can only connect via remote desktop (no mouse/keyboard)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- no usb device is working</p>
<p>- There is an unknown device&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location:&nbsp;Port_#0001.Hub_#0002</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>Hardware id: USB\VID_8087&amp;PID_0024</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any idea how this could be resolved please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To
 know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update Drivers and BIOS</strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website and download the compatible drivers
 for your system.</span>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you update the chipset of the system. Also update the BIOS, to do so, either contact system manufacturer or download it from the support website.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Disclaimer: </em><span><span><em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

            <p>Dear Sahil, thank you for your comments - Yes I have tried all the three steps described above. I did not know about the "Clean Install" but did not do the trick either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded the latest drivers (for Gigabyte&nbsp;z68xp-ud3p) + the original driver DVD + Win7 installation disc all into one folder -&nbsp;I think recognising the USB driver should work without many additional tricks.... but not in this case...<br />
</p>
<p>Do you know the file name containing the original Win 7 USB drivers? May installing these in safe mode or after "clean boot" helps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that defragmentation is not recommended in an SSD drive or for that matter in a RAID setup.</p>
<p>The operating system detects the presence of an SSD and optimizes operation accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not defragment RAID 0 or RAID 5&nbsp;arrays. It is not recommended since the RAID controller determines where the bytes are written to on the two (or more) physical drives. Any benefit you receive will be extremely short-lived as a few writes later you will
 be extremely fragmented again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the information provided was helpful and do let us know if you need any assistance in the future. We will be glad to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Garmin Express</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to down load Maps on my Garmin GPS nuvi 1350. I downloaded Garmin express but get message that it cant find the device but the GPS is plugged into PC with USB cable. I did some trouble shooting and got message 'this device cannot start (Code
 10), then I got another msg 'Currently this device is not connected to the computer (code 45). Later I found another msg 'problem with PnP devices'. My PC has windows 7 system and is only 12 months old.&nbsp; I naturally tried all the usb ports in the PC.&nbsp; I went
 to Windows update and down loaded any updates not yet loaded.&nbsp; Reading some comments in Help I got the feeling it might have something to do with drivers?</p>
<p>I hope you can help me so I can update the maps as I have a lifetime of map downloads.</p>
<p>regards</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
As per your description I have understood that the .net framework updates are not getting installed on your Windows 7 machine.</span></p>
<p><span>This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:
<br />
a. If the Windows Update database is corrupted.<br />
b. If the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service and Cryptographic Service do not receive a content link header.<br />
c. If a required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.<br />
1. What is the error message that you receive while installing the updates.<br />
2. Which security software are you using on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the below given methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may run the Windows Update Troubleshooter from the below link:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>The windows update troubleshooter diagnoses and fixes common windows update issues, automatically.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
After running the windows update troubleshooter, please try to install the .net framework updates again in Clean Boot state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to put the computer into Clean Boot State: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please follow the below steps to put the computer into Clean Boot:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click Start, type Msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.<br />
<strong>Note If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, you should type the password or click Continue.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Disclaimer: Please ensure that you after you try installing the updates, put the computer back to normal state from the clean boot state</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above mentioned steps does not work, then please try to install the updates manually from the given below links:</span></p>

<p><span>Could you provide a new Sample file in version 16.2.156 via private message? Sample file will help us to identify the cause of most of the high CPU usage issues. I have sent you another private message to collect the sample. Please click

<p>
</p><p>At the login screen I used my Microsoft-Account and everything works fine, except the CPU usage. Now I filled in my local domain user too. The CPU usage is on a normal level now.</p>

<h2>            PC won&#39;t boot past mfg logo after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>The other day my PC did some Windows 10 updates. Now when I turn the PC on, I can hear the hard drive start, but then it just goes to the mfg logo and the drive stops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no evidence of Windows even trying to boot so no option for safe mode. I can get to the Bios settings but that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting multiple times and just leaving it on for a while but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?</p>

            On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

            Thanks for the quick reply. Before I try this, I would like to know if this process will impact non-system files as I have many photos saved that I don't think are backed up.

            No-Nothing would be deleted by startup repair. However, if the disk has failed that is a different thing, which Startup repair should tell you.

<p>Well I finally fixed my PC, not sure why I couldn't get the installation media to work initially.&nbsp; Whilst trying to sort out my issue, I decided to buy an external drive bay to see if I could recover my pictures.&nbsp; The hard drive was completely intact and
 using my laptop I found all my stuff in a Windows.old folder which I found out is what Windows creates during an update.&nbsp; I copied all my stuff then tried to boot from the HD from my desktop using the external drive bay on my laptop.&nbsp; That wouldn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I decided to try again and not exactly sure how I did it, but I was able to get into repair mode or something (blue screen with various icons to pick (Continue, Troubleshoot, Turn off, Startup Repair).&nbsp; I tried a few of them, but it couldn't fix the
 problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally had success with the 'Reset this PC' option and was able to get Windows 10 to reinstall and keep all my files.&nbsp; I got a nice surprise in that during this process it removed all the bloatware the mfg had installed and some programs I no longer needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a very painful process and obviously something must have gone wrong with an update and rendered my PC totally useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now use my PC again with no changes to any hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to put more effort into their update process so this type of thing doesn't happen.&nbsp; I don't know how many times I've had an update with just a black screen so you don't even realise anything is happening.&nbsp; I'm guessing my PC must have been
 turned off during one of these terrible updates with no user notification that something is still running.</p>
