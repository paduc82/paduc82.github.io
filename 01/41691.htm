<h2>            Light blue screen on startup- no mouse, no nothing, won&#39;t go away.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased a new Dell with Windows 8 on it. A few days ago it prompted me to update it to windows 8.1 which I did. Last night, when I went to shut it down, it told me that I needed to install updates. I let it install the updates and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
This morning when I woke up, I turned on my computer like I normally do. It started up, showed me the Dell screen with the little swirly rollercoaster loading thing, and then proceeded to a nice solid light blue screen with absolutely nothing on it. No mouse,
 no nothing, just a handsome shade of blue. I googled this error and similar problems had had a mouse onscreen that they could do things with, but I have nothing.<br />
<br />
When I initially turned it on I didn't think much of it, because I'm used to slower computers, so I usually turn my computer on and then let it boot up while I go take a shower. However, 20 minutes later when I came back from my shower the blue screen was still
 there. No error messages, no mouse, the keyboard didn't do anything, just a blue screen. So I did the natural thing and did a hard shut down. I felt a bit guilty in doing so after it had installed updates last night, because it always tells you to not shut
 down your computer when it's booting up after updates like that, but after 20 minutes I had to try something, so I shut it down.<br />
<br />
When it came back up, it did the exact same thing. Dell screen with the loading symbol, then blue screen with nothing on it. I tried 3 more hard shut downs after that with 20 second intervals between shut downs to make sure it was really off. And now i'm stumped.
<div><br />
I really like the new computer and I would appreciate it if it worked. This is not the first time I've installed windows updates and had them break my computer. Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
-Drew</div>

            Ah, solved. If you run into this error, my problem was that I had plugged in something new that didn't work (an incompatible DVI adapter) the previous day. It didn't do anything at all yesterday, but this morning that was what was keeping the computer
 from booting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So if you find yourself in my situation, ask yourself if you installed anything new since you last restarted your computer.

</p><p>You may also try these steps and let me know if the issue persist:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Quit </strong>Skype.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Skype </strong>in Cortana, right-click the Skype icon and choose
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Press <strong>Windows key </strong>and <strong>R </strong>on your keyboard at the same time. On the
<strong>Run dialog</strong> box, type in <strong>%appdata%</strong> and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Open the Skype folder and delete <strong>shared.xml</strong>. On the same folder, look for your Skype name, open it and delete
<strong>config/config.xml</strong> folder.</p>
<p>5. Restart your device.</p>

            Hi George.  <br /><br />Did you check at Settings, Apps and Features if there to uninstall?<br /><br />How about at Settings, Update &amp; Security, Windows Update, Installed Update History, Uninstall?  <br /><br />Lastly type System Restore in Start Search, go back to last point before it installed.<br /><br />Scan your System with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner to be sure.

<br />If that doesn't work try this:
<br />Go to My Computer &gt; C &gt; Windows &gt; System 32 , look for the file named ‚ÄúMRT.exe‚Äù and then delete it .

            Hi GeorgeO1, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />Why do you want to remove it? 
<br />
<br />The MSRT will run from Windows Updates on Patch Tuesday or close (when your system does update) once a month.
<br />
<br />It is a stand-alone tool so you can just delete it.
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\System32  look for and delete MRT.exe .

<p>It does not appear among the Apps and features nor does it appear on the program and features list. Nor does it appear on the list of updates which may be uninstalled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the January&nbsp; MRT tool as the Windows Automatic update of&nbsp; it failed.&nbsp; Hence it does not appear in the installed updates list I have found the location of the application file by&nbsp; right clicking on the MRT run command. Right clicking on the application

<p>Thanks to all. On balance just deleting the application file seems the easiest option. I will wait and see if the next MSRT update&nbsp; is installed by automatic updating. If so I can leave the file MRT as it is not taking up much space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those advocating an approach other than deleting don't explain why not to delete or are unsure. A restore point approach seems a less involved approach than a safe mode/file picking approach.</p>

<p>I can't speak for George but I have found that some enterprises rely on other tools and must remove the application when a non-support person inadvertently installs it. Some support staff are equally as guilty of this and have no clue that it was installed.
</p>
<p>After a couple of cycles through the Vulnerability Management process, the application is flagged as a vulnerability and the "Patch Team" has no clue on how to handle the vulnerability because they don't patch that application. Then we're stuck with trying
 to explain that the exe can be removed and walk them through the steps. sigh, if only a clear explanation of all components possibly related to the MRT could be easily found by the less experienced support professionals. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>For those not involved with managed systems (SOHO), unless the application is causing problems, it's recommended to leave it and let it do its job.

<h3> dcalves1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second Display Cycling &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;</h2>
                    My OS is Windows 7. I have been using dual displays (monitors). Both displays have been working wonderfully on the "extend desktop" &nbsp;setting.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I tried to install an old game "Railroad Tycoon II" on my computer. It seemed to be installing, but my monitors suddenly acted weird (my second one acted the weirdest then went black). Now my second monitor is cycling power on, then power off
 endlessly. I have to unplug it &nbsp;to get it to stop turning on and off.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>What might be causing this endless second display cycling on and off? &nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Now It even cycles on and off when not plugged into the computer.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh, yes, I already uninstalled RR Tycoon II. Also restored system to a previous saved point.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope this is something really simple. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The display that's turning on and off by itself is: an Acer AL 1711</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Specific Processes and Services are taking too much RAM</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello there, Microsoft agents</strong><br />
<br />
Recently, i've been struggling to find a solution for this &gt;_&lt; Over 40% of my memory is used, don't know why, and i can't continue playing games, they crash after a while saying "The game has ran out of memory" don't go too deep and ask about what are these
 games... Anyway, i opened Resource Monitor to find what's eating up my RAM.. and found these in the top: MsMpEng.exe ~60,000KB | svchost.exe (LocalSystemNetworkRestricted) ~110,000KB |<br />
Also, svchost.exe (netsvcs) changes from time to time and the usual is ~45,000KB and at a moment it goes +300,000KB..... Craaazy!!<br />
<br />
If you think i have a virus then don't bother asking me to download some apps to scan because i did already and found 0 threats or malware, also i did not install any ANTI-VIRUS except Microsoft Security Essentials, so far. Any help would be really appreciated!<br />

            <p>None of this looks unusual.</p>
<p>MsMpEng.exe is Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>Svchost.exe (netsvcs) hosts Windows Update. Memory use will go up to around 1MB if available during update check or installing MSE definition updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An out of memory message when there is available RAM is caused by the paging file being too small. Windows guarantees that it is able to supply virtual memory that programs have requested even if they&nbsp;have not used it. If the committed memory would exceed
 the sum of RAM and paging file space, Windows begins to reject memory allocation requests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can change the font and size and then save it as a template - ex: default.wri<br />
</p>
<p>Navigate to this file and make it read only. Make a shortcut to it and use this as WordPad in future.</p>
<p>It will always come up with the font settings you had set but you will have to save it with a new name each time (you usually do anyway).</p>
<p>There is no other way to keep the font setting in WordPad.</p>

            Hello, I'm Sheri. I'll be happy to assist you.
<br />
<br />If you are syncing the files and folders they will be available in both places. Is that what you mean?
<br />
<br />They are essentially duplicated, yes.
<br />

            Hi Alex,
<br />
<br />Yes OneDrive will duplicate your files in the OneDrive Folder on your hard drive . . 
<br />
<br />I find this very wasteful and really defeats the purpose of Cloud Storage. Te only way to avoid this is to set OneDrive to 'Files on Demand' however that option will mean that your files will only be stored on OneDrive and not on your PC
<br />
<br />All Cloud Storage Applications (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.) perform this duplication on your hard drive and that process can very quickly eat up the space on your hard drive       
        </p>

            Hi, Sheri. Yes, I know that it copies the files in the onedrive cloud. My doubt is locally. For example. When the pictures folder is selected to be synchronized C: \ Users \ "User" \ OneDrive, will it be duplicated in C: \ Users \ zooro \ Pictures \ taking
 up more space on the hard drive?<br />
<br />
C: \ Users \ "User" \ OneDrive \ "file.jpg" 500kb<br />
double<br />
C: \ Users \ zooro \ Pictures \ "file.jpg" 500kb<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

    <title>Emoji Password on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calmsea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emoji Password on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Can you help me repair my laptop from my dumbness (Anyways I recovery it to Factory state that is formerly on Windows 7 Home Premium)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happened..</p>
<p>I was thinking a cool password but easy to enter to TRY, so what came to my mind is to set a password emoji. I used the Touch Keyboard on Windows 10 so I can type emoji (not On-Screen Keyboard). Then after I entered an emoji "grin" it showed 2 bullet dots.,
 I tried it but then after I locked my laptop I was shocked because there is no Touch Keyboard out there, only there is On-Screen Keyboard but there is no Emoji there but I need the laptop so what I did is just use the recovery mode built in to laptop so I
 was reverted back to Windows 7. Is there a way to fix this even I resetted my laptop?</p>

<h2>            is the Windows 8 sticker tampered&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I looked at the bottom of my tablet, and i thought that the windows 8 sticker looked kinda odd, it has lines in the white part of the logo.....
</p>
<p>it is already two years old, and jt is at the bottom of the dock... It shows normal wear, but i thought those lines were suppose to mean it was messed with....

I'm having the same problem with the same kind of laptop. Updating the display drivers would be all well and good except there's no way to log onto the computer. The flashing lock screen won't allow you to log in, so there's no way to get to the device manager.
 Anyone have any thoughts?

            <p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's that stupid Fast Access Facial recognition software that Dell puts on the computer that causes it. The fix is fairly basic but a bit tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need to get into safe mode, which is hard to do in 10 if you can't log into your computer. For some inexplicable reason Microsoft decided only to let you reboot into safe mode after you log into your computer normally...which kind of defeats the
 purpose of safe mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways. First, you can use the Windows 10 clean install tool offered by Microsoft and linked by Wasemulla S above, to create a bootable media. This is probably the easiest way. You will be able to get into repair functions (including rebooting
 into safe mode) that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatey you can trick your system into booting into legacy mode, which will allow you to hit F12 right at boot to get into setup. I believe if you interrupt the boot cycle (by turning off the computer partway through--hold down the power button till it
 shuts down) it will go into repair mode eventually, allowing you to get in here. But the repair ISO is probably a safer bet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're into Safe Mode you'll be able to get in. The trick now is uninstalling Fast Access. Windows doesn't activate its uninstaller in Safe Mode. You can, however, fix this. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.raymond.cc/blog/uninstall-programs-packaged-with-windows-installer-in-safe-mode/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an addendum to the above, your Start menu won't function in safe mode, either. If you right click on the Start button, however, you'll bring up a popup menu with all the options you need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the uninstaller running again, simply go into Control Panel and uninstall Fast Access. Reboot normally. Problem solved!!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update Fix - Error 0xC1900101 ID 0x30018 and 0x3000D SOLVED&#33;</h2>
                    <div>If you cannot install Windows 8.1 update, try this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had the 0x30018 driver error; then the 0x3000D PC settings error.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both are now fixed and finally the 8.1 Pro upgrade installed. All seems to work smooth on my 3.5 year old Asus G73JH laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note, before trying any re install attempt I did win btn + r and entered wsreset to clear the Windows Store 8.1 cache.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First, I uninstalled Splashtop and LogMeIn remote apps...anything that seemed to be a "deep" potential driver issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also unplugged external USB devices. Left Wireless enabled, disabled LAN and Bluetooth networks in the device manager.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upgraded my AMD drivers to the latest stable version...and made sure windows update was current.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This got me past the 0x30018 driver freeze... Getting Devices Ready.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next, I went to win btn + r and entered msconfig &gt; services tab and clicked disable all btn.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This got me past the 0x3000D PC settings error and to a successful 8.1 update.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Then after doing the start up 8.1 initial settings and a reboot I went back in MSConfig and enabled all services that I disabled previously. And also, plugged back in my external USB devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to do another OS install on the same machine (Asus G73JH Laptop)&nbsp;as I meantioned above... but no go this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for me this round was </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clean Win 8 Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did just one round of windows updates... 90+ then tried the store 8.1 update link button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After the store download&nbsp;message turned from downloading to installing... I hit the win key to jump&nbsp;into the start menu screen and typed in control panel ... then opened the device manager and manually disabled all network items... wireless, lan, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Then went into control panel devices and printers and removed my printer...may not be necessary.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.1 installed with no issues. I never did update my drivers before the installation. Then after the update, I enabled all networking and updated everything.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I also updated my G750JS that uses Broadcom drivers without jumping through any&nbsp;hoops... so it may just be the QUALCOMM drivers used on my G73JH. ...Or something completely different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
</div>
<div>Brett</div>

<div>On your keyboard... press the windows button and the r button together to get the run input field. Then just type in wsreset and click enter. This will reset your store cache so you can re-download the latest 8.1 update. Go back to your store and redownload
 the 8.1 update. Good to do if it has been a while since you last update attempt.</div>

            Thank you so much! &nbsp;This actually worked for me! &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did not have logmein or splashtop to uninstall, but I did have an issue with the AMD quickstream which caused me to get error 0x80240031. &nbsp; After uninstalling it, I was able to actually get past that error and get the download done; however the install
 failed with the error you noted above (0xc1900101 -0x20017). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Taking your advice, I ran msconfig and disabled all services, removed all external devices and refreshed my store (wsreset.exe). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then went to the store and started the 8.1 download yet again. &nbsp;It took quite some time and even looked as though it may have been hanging a few times but it was not - it finally was successful and I now have windows 8.1. Woohoo!lol &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

    <title>Motherboard crash, need help saving drives in a RAID 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> commandozach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Motherboard crash, need help saving drives in a RAID 1</h2>
                    I was running a Dell Alienware Aura desktop with Windows 7. The motherboard has crashed and I do not want to fool with Dell to get it fixed. I had 3 hard drives. Drive 1 - OS and programs. Drives 2,3, setup as RAID 1 to mirror the data in case one of my
 drives failed. Well as luck would have it the motherboard failed first and now I am lost. The people I have spoken to tell me that there is nothing I can do with those drives anymore and that they are now scrap....
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is; How can I take those drives (data only, no OS) and reclaim my files? Can I simply install one of them into a new machine? I do not care about the RAID anymore, I just want to have access to my files. Can someone tell me what to do pretty
 please? Thanks!!!</div>

            <p>If I was to make any change I would use a USB to SATA adapter to connect the (ex) RAID disk to the new build AFTER the system has booted. That way you know that the O/S is not going to make any changes to the drive during the boot when you have no control
 or visibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many sneer at the software RAID functions within Windows and in business circumstances probably correctly so but it has one advantage in that it is completely non dependant on any hardware. With RAID 1 being just a Mirror it has little performance
 degradation in comparison with a card based solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also found that RAID based on the Intel chipset migrates very well to another Intel motherboard. Even to the extent that when I plugged one into a small PC with only one SATA interface the RAID config screen showed when the BIOS itself did not support
 it (hard to do with only one SATA port:))</p>

            Hello Wolfen, I‚Äôd recommend that you run an antivirus program. Infection or malware is the most possible reason for your issue. However, it can be caused by bad work of copy-paste function.
<br />If you have the on-screen keyboard, try copying a short text to check. Does the issue persist? 
<br />Looking at the provided file path, I can assume that a steam app is not working properly or crashed. Try deleting the files in this temp folder. This is a temporary folder, deleting those files will not affect your performance but can resolve the issue.
