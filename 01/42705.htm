            <p>Hi Celine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Did you check if your laptop Bluetooth switch is turned on? </li><li>Do you see Bluetooth indicator light on the laptop?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You won't see a Bluetooth settings page if your PC doesn't support Bluetooth. If you're certain that your PC supports Bluetooth but there's no settings page for it, check the info that came with your PC or your manufacturer's website for steps to turn on
 the Bluetooth hardware for your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Follow the troubleshooting steps from this Microsoft article and check if it helps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why isn't Windows finding my Bluetooth or other wireless device?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to uninstall the old Bluetooth drivers from device manager and reinstall latest Windows 8.1 drivers from Asus website and check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press&nbsp;Windows key + X</li><li>Click&nbsp;on Device manager</li><li>Search for Bluetooth drivers right click on it and select uninstall.</li><li>Restart&nbsp;the computer download the latest Bluetooth drivers from your laptop support website and install it and check if Bluetooth works:</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check for drivers on Windows Update. Refer this article: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></p>

<h2>            Battery timer not appearing</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this laptop about a week ago or so (HP Envy x360 2-in-1) and I noticed that when I check how much battery I have left at the bottom right corner, I could only see the percentage but no timer with a calculation of how long the battery will last
 within that charge. Is there an option that I can use to enable the battery timer?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you update your Windows 10 and see if the issue persists. Here's how to check for updates for Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>
Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If Windows Update says your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you&nbsp; check with the device's manufacturer's website if your BIOS firmware is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the results.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>If your charger is plugged in when you check battery remaining you will only get a %age reading. Try it with the charger turned off and you should see the actual time remaining. It can't give a time left reading whilst charging because when on charge you
 will always have constant time left, just a %age reading.&nbsp; If you hover over the icon whilst charging a low battery it will give you the time left to full charge.</p>

    <title>Xbox Back Door to Family Timer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> da painkillar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Back Door to Family Timer</h2>
                    
<p>MY kid is getting passed the family timer function using a bypass that calls for going to the settings screen and opening the family timer function. &nbsp;He then presses the home button repeatedly. &nbsp;You'll notice the family timer pop-up stays open between the
 presses. &nbsp;He can move the selection between these window cycles using the analog stick to get to the family timer then presses A button to get in. &nbsp;He now has full control of the timer which is a major breakdown in the system in my opinion if it can't be fixed
 with a simple patch or download/update. &nbsp;Where can I find the patch and/or update to fix this obvious error? &nbsp;I'm surprised Microsoft hasn't fixed this already since this procedure is posed on YouTube. &nbsp;I found it in 30 seconds of searching the internet.</p>

<p>Please help,</p>

<p>Need an answer.</p>

<p>Hey there Pain! I've tried reproducing this on my console with a parent/child account, but when I try accessing the Family settings on the Child account, it asks for the Passcode before ever showing me the Family Timer. Can you let us know how your son is
 bypassing this setting? Did you set up a Passcode? If not, please give that a try and see if it prevents your son from accessing it. Let us know, thanks!

<p>Yes.&nbsp; I have a Passcode set up.&nbsp; This is not the issue.&nbsp; If you enter the system using your child's account and navigate to the Settings, Family, Content Controls, pressing the A button gets you to the Enter Pass Code screen.&nbsp; If you set your brightness
 high enough on your screen, you'll see the Content Controls Menu screen behind the Enter Pass Code screen.&nbsp;While holding the left analog stick down, rapidly press the center button on the controller and you'll see the scroll bar highlight sequence down step
 by step as the screen chacycles between&nbsp;Enter Pass Code&nbsp;and Xbox Guide.&nbsp; If you don't have the timing right (usually the case when not&nbsp;pressing the center button&nbsp;fast enough) you'll end up back to the Content Controls.&nbsp; It took me about 10 min to get the hang
 of it and then I was a pro.&nbsp; Once you get the hang of scrolling the Content Controls Menu using this process, you need to learn stop at the Xbox Guide when the Ratings and Content or the Family Timer are highlighted.&nbsp; I take a few second breather then press
 the center button followed immediately by the A button.&nbsp; You need to be quick.&nbsp; My kid can do it without the breather and he's 11.&nbsp; That last maneauver selects the highlighted option and you are in.&nbsp; From that point you have total control and in this way have
 bypassed the need to enter a Pass Code altogether, which my kid does not know by the way.&nbsp; If you take the&nbsp;time to mess with it you will be reproducing the problem yourself easilly.&nbsp; FYI, I have two systems in my house, one of them a Kinect system, and I can
 do it on both.&nbsp; You guys need to close this back door as he can change not only the timer but ratings and content, etc.&nbsp; I suppose you already know what kind of problem that presents.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>I appreciate the detailed steps here Killar! I'm still seeing a discrepency on my side though. When I navigate to Settings &gt; Family I am immediately asked for the Passcode here. I cannot get to Content Controls at all. When I try the analog stick and Guide
 button, it just brings me back out to the Settings Hub.<br />
<br />
If you could provide a video of this behavior it would really help me out in understanding this and then we could see about helping with the issue. In the meantime, if you are aware that your child is bypassing the parental settings, I would recommend discussing
 that with him/her at your discretion. Thanks!</p>

<p>The reason you can't get passed the Family window before getting the Enter Pass Code is because you didn't enter into a child account (or any account for that matter).&nbsp; It really doesn't matter because I just bypassed the Pass Code entry with the situation
 you desribed by not going into my kid's account and like you was confronted with the Enter Pass Code screen right at the Family window.&nbsp; Either way, you can beat the system using this procedure.&nbsp; As&nbsp;far as discussing it with the kid, he's the one who told
 me about it so he's fine.&nbsp; That's not the point.&nbsp; MS sold a product and it should work as advertised, I don't sit on his head 24/7 and want him to be able to use the time we give to him.&nbsp; By the way, I used to debug code for a living so I understand how it
 works and I know it can be fixed if someone were inclined to do something about it.</p>
<p>I have a two part video showing the process.&nbsp; In my video, I went into the child account so you will see the Content Controls window to the right of the&nbsp;three or four family accounts I have.&nbsp;I had trouble getting the timing right so you'll see several failures
 before I get in.&nbsp; Like I said, it takes practice.&nbsp; You can access the videos at Youtube.&nbsp;

<p>Hey there Painkillar, I just thought I would stop by here and give this a shot for myself using my personal Parent and Child account. I was unable to reproduce this using the steps provided earlier in the thread, but I will give it another go when I get
 a chance later today or tomorrow. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Just to confirm I'm going through the right process though... Here's the things I tried.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Sign into child profile. &gt; Navigate to Famly Settings &gt; In family, only option available is content controls. Attempted to turn the family settings on which prompts for family passcode. From here I was unable to complete the workaround you mentioned before.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I also tried the same steps using the parent profile to see if I can bypass the passcode from the parent account, but was also unsucessful.

<p>Gentlemen, I have been patiently waiting and have not heard a single word regarding this subject. &nbsp;I had anticipated some sort of status updates. In an effort to prevent my son from accessing the machine while still allowing my two daughters to access the
 machine, I decided to delete the list of exceptions in the contents control. &nbsp;This has backfired as he is able to use the same procedure to change to the content access to mature setting. &nbsp;This is now worse as he has access to explicit content. &nbsp;I would think
 that Microsoft would want to avoid this liability exposure and would get off the stick and deal with this. What's up? &nbsp;Is there a way to elevate this problem report?</p>

1. This happens whenever I try to install ANY app from the App Store.&nbsp; Further, in some place the store says I installed them but when I try toi run them I get an attempt to install them and the error message 0x80070005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This has happened fro the beginning when I did a clean install of Windows 8 Pro on the system after failing to install as a upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Not one step helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I did an easy transfer of these accounts&nbsp;to a Windows 8 not pro on a new laptop computer and they work there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IO have two suggestions for Microsoft:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Contact me and I will let them look at both computers to search for differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Have a FixStore program that reinstalls any missing files, establishes any permissions required and checks the Registry to make sure everything is there. NOTE: the apps store diagnostic doesn't fix the problem.</p>

            0x80070005 is a generic error code meaning "Access is denied". No one can help unless you provide the details of the situation in which you see this error. In other words what are you trying to do?

I did run the upgrade assistant before I installed Windows 8.&nbsp; (It didn't catch all the old software.&nbsp; I had to do a clean install.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report doesn't tell me, an educated user, enough to resolve the problem.&nbsp; I hope it tells Microsoft enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate your help - and everyone else's.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Connect to a network&#34; window won&#39;t open</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
Since installing some windows vista updates, the " <strong>Connect to a network</strong> " window won't open (no matter how I try to open it). Everything else in the network menu works fine. It's not a modem problem either because I can see the available networks
 with another software. Still, I prefer to use the Vista software.<br />
I have tried setting back to the last restore point but it hasn't helped.<br />
I have seen in the net that some other people are having this problem to but I haven't found a solution.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            Hi arcadia78,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Are you on a home or business network?<br />
The other software for your phone, does it allow you to connect to the Internet through your computer or connect your computer through your phones connection to the Internet?<br />
<br />
I ask because if your using the phone to connect to the Internet through a cellular network, it's going to modify your network settings.<br />
<br />
When you uninstalled the software, I was suggesting testing the computers Internet connection before your re-installed it to see if it was changing your settings. ;)<br />
<br />
If none of that is helping, you can try using the System File Checker to look for missing or corrupted files.<br />
<p><strong><span>The System File Checker tool</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run
 the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.
<br />
<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, and then type
<strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click
<strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong> . </span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong> </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span>
</strong><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h3> samcswong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Photos is totally broken. Can&#39;t show OneDrive Albums ,High CPU usage, Indexing takes forever and more.....</h2>
                    <p>Got my laptop back from service center, reset Windows and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Photos can never show my OneDrive photo albums. It can display photos stored in OneDrive even it says cannot connect. App closes by itself frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have years of photos in my OneDrive in a separate folder called Family Photos, over 100k photos. If I set to include Photos in all folders in settings, CPU usage will go over 10%. Guess Photos app was trying to index all photos. It may take days to finish
 the process. Am I suppose to leave Photos app running, disable power saving on my laptop to let the process finish?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good to see new features coming in but sad to see stability goes....</p>

<br />Select it 
<br />Click Advanced options 
<br />Click Reset 
<br />
<br />Restart

<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type the following, hit Enter the restart. 
<br />

            Ok I understand, it happens that sometimes the Windows is not properly installed, for several reasons either because the Windows to install is damaged or corrupt, always is good idea to put it back in a USB drive, you can also check the Ram Memory or the hard drive , it is always convenient to review these details.
<br />
<br />Ok I'll give you some tips.
<br />
<br />1.- Review the Ram Memory with (Memtest86)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />2.- Check your SSD or HDD with (chkdsk)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872425.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee8...</a>
<br />
<br />3.- Re-create the USB or DVD to install the Operating System, because sometimes it is damaged or corrupted.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Got updated to 2018.18061.17410.0 and now that on my desktop PC is broken too. All OneDrive albums were disappeared. Still on OneDrive web luckily. It's rebuilding the whole photo database from scratch. Why Microsoft keeps releasing new updates to introduce
 new bugs.. 😅😅😅</p>

<p>
</p><p>A Windows Password Reset Disk is something that you must make in advance while you are logged on. If you could create retrospectively, what would be the value of a password? Anyone could then make such a disk and access your data!</p>

<h2>            MTP Device - You do not have permission to access</h2>
                    &lt;!-- [if !mso]&gt; &lt;object classid="clsid:38481807-CA0E-42D2-BF39-B33AF135CC4D" id=ieooui&gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;mce:style&gt; &lt;!-- [if gte mso 10]&gt; &lt;mce:style&gt;
<p>I know this is a bit verbose but forums are still a new thing for me and I don't know what all you need to know. If it is too lengthy, please forgive the attempt to be comprehensive up front and just pass by rather than telling me how I am writing too much.</p>
<p>We use our PC for e-mail, word processing, browsing, and digital image storage. Beginning five days ago, none of our several flash drives, external hard drives, or either of our two (different brands) Wireless USB Adapters will work on any of our home PC's
 six USB ports (OS: XP Home SP3, fully updated). We have tested this with every flash drive we own. When we connect a USB device, Windows wants to troubleshoot. Every time we plug a flash drive into a USB, the USB is identified as an "MTP Device". Clicking
 on it brings up the box: “You do not have permission to access”.</p>
<p>Insertion into any USB port - while immediately powered and detected - is not recognized. The biggest problem is that currently, w/o an ability to use a wireless adapter, we do not have Internet access. We cannot transfer anything on or off of this PC with
 any external storage media.</p>
<p>Each one of these flash drives or Wireless USB Adapters work just fine on any other computer – just (since last Friday) not on our PC. We are not aware of having made any registry changes, software additions or changes, and the anti-virus is current and
 clean. There are six USB ports on this PC. All of them recognize and work just fine with the USB for the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse. Any USB chip, flash, or external drive with a storage capability is identified as an MTP Device.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting: We have disabled the Norton Security Suite of Software. Microsoft’s “System Restore” is not able to restore to any of the earlier set points. How can we get it back to allow use of the USB ports? Searching the web, I see that others who
 have had problems related to the use of USB’s being inaccessible and identified as an MTP Device are often related to the Zune or Apple iPod device’s software. We do not use either iPods or Zunes so it is not from either of those softwares. I also learned
 that XP requires either Media Player 10 or 11 and be kept up-to-date for managing MTP Devices. Because we do not have Internet access anymore, I downloaded the upgrade to WMPlayer 11 onto a friend’s PC, burned it to a DVD, and installed it here. Even that
 did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>We are crippled here and nothing else seems to help. We cannot load information onto or off this PC and would like to be able to access our e-mail from home again. This must have happened to others before, can anyone point us toward a solution? Any suggestions
 would be most welcome. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>First of all there is no be all to end all anti-virus program that detects everything or there would be only 1.Secondly HACKERS have ways to hide their programs in with files that are needed to run windows which is why they can go undetected because they
 mimic your system files.If it just started happening 5 days ago you should be able to do a system restore to before that date and rectify the problem.If your not familiar with restore.Click start,highlite all programs go to accessories then go to system tools
 and you will see system restore.Click system restore and a page will appear saying restore my system to an earlier date click next.On the next page you will see a calander.Pick a date before it started acting up and click on it then next.It will tell you this
 will restore your unit to that date.Click next or continue and the system will take over.When it is done it will restart and a window will appear telling you it was completed succesfully.Just check the box that says do not show this box again.That should rectify
 the problem.If it says the system could not be restored to that date there is a good chance you have a bug.If that is the case go to the control panel click system and click system restore.Check the box that says turn off system restore because if it won't
 restore there is a good chance system restore is infected.It will delete the restore points and any bug that is in it.Next start the system in safemode with networking and run this program from the link below.It is very good at detecting bugs.Even if your
 system restore fixes the problem it won't hurt to run this program anyway.</p>

<span>Hi irmgil,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Verify the Volume Shadow copy service:</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type services.msc (without quotation marks) in the Search bar and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>If UAC (User Account Control) window is prompted for permission to continue, please click "Continue".</span></p>
<p>
<span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Double click Volume Shadow Copy Service and switch to General tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Change the Startup type to Automatic and click Apply.</span></p>
<p>
<span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start and click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After performing the above steps, check whether the issue is resolved or not. If the issue persists, Please proceed to method 2.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to perform backup process in Clean Boot state</span><span>and check which non microsoft program is causing
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may follow the steps provided in the below mentioned link to perform Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>(Australia here - it sent me an SMS immediately when I changed the email address to tell me that the email had been added in security settings but for some reason cannot send the code to verify the account)</p>

</p><p>When I try to use the support site it just says "Something went wrong, we can't sign you in just now check back later" - so I can't login to the website account, can't verify by phone ... I'm so glad to have such 'security' that I can't even access my own
 account......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can I get an SMS telling me the email has been changed, but can't get an SMS with the security code ? this is driving me nuts....

<br />
1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
In-order to get the webcam working, you will need to have drivers installed. If the drivers are already installed, then I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the updated drivers.<br />
<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong> Run the Hardware troubleshooter
<br />
a) Press “Windows Key + R”, type Control Panel.<br />
b) Then type “Troubleshooting” in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c) Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d) Select “Hardware”.<br />
e) Follow the On Screen instructions.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the latest webcam drives. If Windows 8.1 drivers are not available, install the driver in Windows 7 compatibility mode
 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and save it on to the Desktop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Windows Key + R, type devmgmt.msc.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand the Webcam, click on the driver.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on properties, click on uninstall tab.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the driver (Downloaded from the manufacturer’s website) file.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Properties and select the Compatibility tab.<br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the checkbox before Run this program in Compatibility mode for option and select Windows
<br />
h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list-down box; then try installing the device driver via Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
Hope it help. Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</p>

    <title>Printing the filepath in Notepad in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glennmarble  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing the filepath in Notepad in Windows 10</h2>
                    Printing the File Name in the header or footer of Notepad is done with the "&amp;f" command. However, I am unable to find the command for printing the complete filepath, e.g., C:\Users\Username\Documents\Foldername\Filename.txt. I believe this used to be done
 with the "&amp;F" command in earlier versions of Windows but it no longer works in Windows 10. How do you do this now?

<p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in printing the complete file path on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We have looked into this for you, the ‘<strong>&amp;f</strong>’ command in the Windows 10 Notepad will print the name of the&nbsp;file and not the complete path.

<p>tengo un mando que está fallando y he comprado otros dos. uno para sustituir al que tenía y el otro para poder jugar simultáneamente con mi hijo. he vinculado ambos a la consola y cada uno tiene ya su indicador (el 2 y el 3). y puedo moverme por el interface
 de xbox con ellos una vez activados ambos a la vez. Pero cuando abro el juego al que quiero jugar (lego star wars 2 TCS), no me deja cargar mi partida diciendo "no tienes un perfil de jugador activo. se desactivarán el guardado y logros. para crear o cargar
 un perfil de jugador ahora, pulsa el botón guía xbox". SI HE INICIADO MI CONSOLA CON ESE PERFIL, porqué no me deja cargar mi partida? qué debo hacer?</p>

<p>he salido del juego. he apagado la consola y la he encendido con uno de los nuevos mandos. el otro está ya encendido cargando conectado a la consola. abro el juego, ahora sí me dejar cargar la partida, pero cuando empieza el juego, sólo puedo moverme con
 el mando que he encendido la consola, el otro no se mueve, aunque tiene el piloto encendido y además está conectado cargando. tan sólo me funciona el botón guía xbox.
</p>
<p>cómo demonios se hace para que funcionen ambos al mismo tiempo? las instrucciones no dicen nada.</p>

<h2>            Brand new computer - Application error on start-up</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased a new Dell laptop with Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched it on for the first time tonight and then had Cortana speak at me for a few minutes while some basic settings were checked and set up. Then it did a massive (3gb) windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On auto-restart it immediately showed a dialog box:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows - Application Error" "The exception unknown software exception (0xc06d007e occurred in the application at location 0x0000000075110882</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done anything with this computer at all yet, and it is error-ing - very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching it off and back on makes no difference. The error dialog box appears as the background login image loads - before I have even logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me solve this problem - I am not a computer expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Matt.</p>

            Hi Matt, you are probably better off starting again . . .
<br />
<br />Make sure your laptop cannot access the Internet, while you are doing the initial setup . . .
<br />
<br />Start the laptop, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Windows Live Mail in Windows 10 Glitching</h2>
                    I open Windows Live Mail (again, in Windows 10). When I attempt to do anything at all within the application it simply closes. How can I fix this? Thank you.

            <p>I am not sure what version is being used. It was downloaded with the free Windows 10 Upgrade, 32-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 did not work. Method 2, no Windows Live Essential is showing in Control Panel/Programs, so unable to uninstall. Method 3, there is no c:/progam files/windows live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I am stumped.</p>
