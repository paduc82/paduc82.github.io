<h2>            Unable to right click at all with the mouse</h2>
                    I am unable to right click at all with my mouse. I am using Windows 7. I have tried to update the driver, but Windows says it's up to date.&nbsp; Any help in figuring this out would be nice.

<p>Hello djt28,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>What changed in your environment when the mouse quit working? <br />
Have you checked with another mouse to see if it works?<br />
Can you go back to a system restore point?<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p>Do you have the most current drivers for your mouse?<br />
<br />
I would do a SFC /scannow to see if you have any corrupt system files.<br />
<span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
Now check again and see if you can right click with your mouse.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply back with an update for us.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8 Unmountable-Boot-Volume and Automatic Repair loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diegodasilva1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8  Unmountable-Boot-Volume and Automatic Repair loop</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 20 Model 3048 and for a few days now, every time I turn the desktop on, It will go through its normal startup by showing the Dell logo. After 10 seconds in, my desktop shows a blue screen and says..</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you (0% complete)".</p>
<p>&nbsp; "If you would like to know more, you can search online later for this error: UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blue screen only shows up for about 3 seconds so I had to take a picture of it. After the blue screen shows up, the computer then does an automatic repair. The automatic repair screen shows up for about 2-3 minutes then goes into a black screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that Unmountable Boot Volume means hardware issues or file corruption but i'm going to give you the specifics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I left the computer on for 3 hours but it did nothing but show the black screen, so I shut the PC off and left it at that. my friend had told me that he had 7 year old computer (Windows 7) that had a similar issue and it was doing an automatic
 repair for 4 hours and finally showed the recovery page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I got home from school, I turned on my PC once again and left it on for a longer time. When it reached 4 hours later, it was saying</p>
<p>"Fixing hardware issues, this might take up to an hour" I didn't think much of it, and when it reached up to 6 hours, my PC then says automatic repair once again and at this point I thought of just leaving it on for longer and the longest time I kept it
 on for was 12 hours and I never got to the recovery page so I got disappointed and shut it off. It would always say automatic repair or fixing hardware failures but It would shut off and turn back on again just to show the blue screen and start all over with
 the whole process. It was a continuous loop and the recovery page was what I was really trying to aim for but I guess it cant really fix the issue itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I had also done things to my PC like, press and hold F12 and go under Diagnostics and I pressed and held F2 to go into setup settings and went through everything such as Boot sequences, Drives, Secure Boot and BIOS.&nbsp; During the diagnostics everything went
 well except for when the computer was testing on the hard drive. It seems to be that the hard drive was the only problem. I couldn't really tell what happened to cause this problem because my PC was fine but then one day these problems ocurred.&nbsp; &nbsp; I did have
 viruses for a whole year and I wouldn't bother to get McAfee or Norton at all and just did whatever I could to ignore it so maybe that was the whole cause but other than that I don't really know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched up for Unmountable Boot Volume for Windows 8, nothing had really helped me and every person that asked this same question had different brands like HP or Lenovo but no Dell. That is why I am asking a question on how to repair this because
 I guess the repairs for this same problem is different for each computer model.&nbsp; There was anything about my PC model anyways.. This computer is 3 years old and I never had an issue like this before</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service tag &lt; <em>Removed by CM</em> &gt; if that helps.. Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong>&nbsp; The error code when I ran diagnostics was 2000-0142</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use your Dell Service Tag, use it with Dell, not here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell has information about your error code, but is a bit vague:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/ht/en/htdhs1/SLN129813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(26, 13, 171, 1)">Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 STOP Error (Blue Screen ... - Dell</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mention a hardware problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>During the diagnostics everything went well except for when the computer was testing on the hard drive. I<strong>t seems to be that the hard drive was the only problem.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But you do not tell us what the error was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell diagnostics gives you error codes to look up:</p>

    <title>Losing Network Connectivity- TCP&#47;IP NetBIOS Helper service was - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexsellers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Losing Network Connectivity- TCP&#47;IP NetBIOS Helper service was successfully sent a stop control.</h2>
                    <p>I am losing network connectivity randomly (from multiple times within 10 minutes to once every 2-3 hours).&nbsp; The event viewer displays the message:
<br />
<br />
The TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service was successfully sent a stop control.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason specified was: 0x40030011 [Operating System: Network Connectivity (Planned)]&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment: None .&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have done extensive research through google and tried many different solutions such as disabling the Computer Browser service, updating all drivers,&nbsp; and making sure that the power settings do not allow for turning off network drivers.&nbsp; I have seen many
 forums dating from 2010-present, and none have held a satisfactory solution.&nbsp; I am using a Dell Latitude E5520 with 32-bit Windows 7 Professional. Most (3 other) computers on the network stay connected, but a similar problem is occurring with one other computer.&nbsp;
 Any feedback would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            Thank you very much for the reply.&nbsp; I tried this and it seemed to work okay for a couple hours, but now I am having the same issues again.&nbsp; Again, I do appreciate your reply, but it doesn't seem to be preventing the problem completely.&nbsp; If there are any
 other steps I could take, I would be grateful for advice.&nbsp; I will try these steps again to ensure that I did not mess them up, but all the commands seemed to run fine.<br />

Thank you.<br />

            <p>Do one thing, go to safe mode with networking. And try to use interenet there. If it works fine then it looks like it is an issue with virus or antivirus protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart</p>
<p>&gt;start tapping F8</p>

<h2>            How to uninstall malfunctioning miniport&#63; PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    My WAN Miniport (Network Monitor) #2 is not working, it has the yellow exclamation mark under it. However, my wifi and chord internet connection are still working fine. I have an Intel adapter and they are also working fine. All of my network stuff except
 for this is working fine. I have a ThinkPad T430 with Windows 8 64. How can I uninstall this malfunctioning Miniport?

            Well, I found a "fix". Seems to work for me (so far).
<div><br />
<div>1. You'll need a copy of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
psexec</a> (SysInternals)</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Run RegEdit as the "SYSTEM" user:</div>
<div>
<div><span>PsExec.exe -i -s -d regedit.exe</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Navigate to&nbsp;</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ROOT\MS_NDISWANBH\0001</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>*Note:</b> the final 0001 number may be different on your system, just look for the one with the "FriendlyName" of "WAN Miniport (Network Monitor) #2" or whatever the name of the malfunctioning adapter is.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Delete this key (the 0001 and everything beneath it)</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Navigate to</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\00xx (where XX maybe be any number) -- you can figure out which adapter it is by going to Device Manager and checking the Details tab of the malfunctioning
 adapter -- drop the menu down to "Driver Key" -- it will show you a number like {4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0016</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Delete that key and its subkeys.</div>
<div><br />
7. Restart your system and the yellow exclamation should be gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck!</div>

<h2>            On Skype, I can see both my video and my friends, but he can&#39;t see me...</h2>
                    I'm new to Skype, but my friend has been using it for quite a while. I can see both my video image and his, but he can't see my image - just a revolving cursor like my video is trying to load. I've checked my Windows 10 privacy settings and camera permissions.
 And on Skype, I have added "share screen and sounds". What can I do, so that he can see me??

<p><strong><span><span>Bug Check 0x50: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA -</span></span>This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</strong></p>
<p>Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
<p><br />
Please check your RAM for errors. Download memtest86+ [1] and run it for several hours.</p>

<p>You appear to be running the latest BIOS version so it may help, at&nbsp;this point,&nbsp;if you could turn on the Driver Verifier to try to identify a problematic third party driver:</p>
<p>Start &gt; type<em> verifier</em>&nbsp;in the Search programs and files box and press "Enter" &gt; Create standard settings &gt; Next &gt; Select driver names from a list &gt; then select all non-Microsoft drivers &gt; Finish<br />
<br />
Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Continue to use the computer normally but if you experience any BSODs make available the&nbsp;minidump files.<br />
<br />
If after enabling the Driver Verifier and restarting the computer you receive a BSOD on startup and cannot start Windows, restart the computer in "Safe Mode" and do the following:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; type<em> verifier</em>&nbsp;in the Search programs and files box and press "Enter"&nbsp;&gt; Delete existing settings &gt; Finish</p>
<p>Restart the computer, log into Normal Mode, and make available any resulting minidump file.</p>

We are aware of the issue. It was put in intentionally due to Microsoft wanting the parent account to be allowed to manage the option&nbsp; for cross play or not. Unfortunately, it taking longer than expected to add it to the settings for parents to manage. We expect
 an update on this situation soon.</p>

            I know it's been a while since this thread started. But the resolution for this issue has never been effective. I've done all the tricks to try. I'm chiming in to not only mention that I have this same issue but also to to complain about Microsoft's insistence
 to force feed those of us something we do not want. I know all of the methods to remove this upgrade notification including the removal of specific updates as you noted as well as turning off the service that is controlling this notification. It keeps returning
 just as Microsoft likely intended. I should sue for harassment because of this. I'm already outraged because rollback never worked for me. I immediately hated Windows 10, especially after I saw how it was violating my privacy in ways I never imagined. For
 instance, giving people access to my router just because they may be a friend on facebook or other social sites. Let's not forget how selecting default web browser was nicely hidden so firefox or other browsers could not allow us

<br />
</span><span>The focus of the active window is dependent on the program you are using. For example if you are
<span>&nbsp;</span>using Paint or Outlook and moved the cursor to another without clicking on it, the focus is still on the active window. Now, for example, if you<span>&nbsp;
</span>have an Internet Explorer <span>&nbsp;</span>window open and moves the cursor off if the active windows, the focus is no longer on the active Windows and will not restore until you had moved back to that active window.</span></p>

    <title>Static&#47;Stuttering with audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> decklin ar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Static&#47;Stuttering with audio</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi There,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I have spent many hours trying to fix my audio on my PC since I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Win 7 Pro. There seems to be a static noise that comes through
 the speakers when playing music through groove, itunes and other media players, even when I play video clips and the same when I watch videos on youtube. This static or stuttering sounds appears at random intervals a lot during any playback. I have tried many
 things from installing Win 10 about 4 times, one of them was a clean install. I had a discrete Asus xonar D1, I check with Asus to see if they would be releasing a Windows 10 driver for it and they said no, so I installed the latest
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>win 8.1 driver for it, this didn’t fix it. I ended up uninstalling the drivers and removing the sound card from out of my PC.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I then setup the onboard Via VT1708S sound chipset and installed the latest drivers(Ver 6.0.11.1000) and the same static/stuttering noise happens.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I have even disabled all enhancements in the speaker properties, I have also ran the “Find and Fix audio playback problems” this came up with no errors. Does anyone have
 any ideas how to fix? Or do I need to go back to Win 7? I have read that many other people have had the same issues and had ideas to fix which I’ve tried and none worked from me This is now most frustrating as I like the look and feel of Win 10 and don’t really
 want to go back to Win 7 just for better audio but feel like I have to as I like my quality sound. Appreciate anybody’s help, maybe I have a conflict somewhere with some devices.</span></p>
<p><span>Below are my system specs :-</span></p>
<p><span>Intel i5 3570 quad core 3.4Ghz</span></p>
<p><span>Asus P8B75-M motherboard</span></p>
<p><span>16Ggb ddr3 memory </span>
</p>
<p><span>Adata 256 SSD drive model SP920SS</span></p>
<p><span>Western Digital 2TB HD model WD20EZR-00DC0B0</span></p>
<p><span>Nvidia GTX 750TI graphics card</span></p>
