<h2>            Windows XP mode will not boot to an iso image</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell OptiPlex Desktop as a work computer. our IT Department created dual boot of Windows 8 and Windows 7. in windows 7 it has a virtual PC and 2 virtual machines which is Windows XP and Windows Vista. I am trying to setup the Windows XP to boot
 to an ISO file on the desktop of my Windows 7, but it keeps on booting to the partition of Windows 8 and getting BSOD. I already set the bios of XP mode to boot into CD-Rom as the boot priority but still keeps on booting to the windows 8 partition. can anyone
 help me on setting up the XP Mode to boot to an ISO image?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><br />
Well, a big honking clue (emphasized in <strong>bold</strong>) might be found in the snippet of your Windowsupdate.log above: KB2530548 was released on 14 June &amp; should have been installed well-before 09 July.</p>
<p>1. Assuming <strong>Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP (KB2497640)
</strong>is listed in Add/Remove Programs, when (exact date) was it installed?</p>
<p>2. Is KB2555917 and/or&nbsp;KB2507938 listed in Add/Remove Programs (yet)?</p>
<p>3. Have you had a McAfee application (e.g., McAfee VirusScan or Antivirus or Internet Security or Total Protection) installed since Day One?</p>
<p>4. Any particular reason you never installed IE7 or IE8? (Just curious...at least at this point.)</p>
<p>PS: Thank you for your very kind words!</p>

            <p>Hello again PA BEAR</p>
<p>You have a keen eye.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks for your attention to the details.
<span>&nbsp;</span>KB2530548 was installed on 6/17 and was downloaded again and ready for re-installation on 7/9.</p>
<p>On 7/10, I did the second install (successfully) for both KB2530548 and KB2508272 (ActiveX Killbits -- the one I noticed that prompted my original post).</p>
<p>Because both KB2530548 and KB2508272 were installed twice, I checked for other re-installs since February 2011 and saw no others.</p>
<p>Answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP (KB2497640) was installed on 4/16</p>
<p>2. KB2555917 &amp; KB2507938 were installed on 7/13 </p>
<p>3. I installed McAfee Total Protection in 2010.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Prior to that, I ran BitDefender.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got the PC brand new in 2003, but don't recall which antivirus I ran back then.</p>
<p>4. I stayed with IE6 because my company had some apps that were not guaranteed to work with IE7 or beyond.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Later when my company said it was OK to upgrade to a later version of IE, I was using Firefox for Web browsing and just never bothered to upgrade IE6.</p>

            PA Bear,<br />
<br />
Regarding your questions about antivirus pgms on my PC, I tracked down some old history.&nbsp; In 2003, I was using Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition (which I was able to get free for home use based on my company's corporate license.)&nbsp; I think I used that until
 2006 when I purchased Bit Defender.&nbsp; Then, as I said, I changed to McAfee last year.<br />

            <p><strong>Recap (primarily for my benefit):</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2497640 (released 12 April 2011) was installed on 16 April 2011 according to Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2508272 (released 12 April 2011) was (finally)&nbsp;installed&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;3&nbsp;months later on 09 July according to Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2530548 (released 14 June 2011) was (finally) installed&nbsp;nearly a&nbsp;month&nbsp;later on 09 July according to Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2555917 &amp; KB2507938 (released 12 July 2011) were installed on 13 July.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2544521, KB2544893, KB2535512, KB2393802 &amp; KB971029 are all listed in Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Symantec AntiVirus (Corporate) was the first AV installed in 2003 and was replaced by a Bit Defender application at some point&nbsp;in 2006. The Bit Defender application was replaced by McAfee Total Security at some point in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Questions:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Assuming KB980195 is listed in Add/Remove Programs, when (exact date) was it installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; If KB980195 is <em>not</em> listed, how about KB978262? ...or KB973525?</p>
<p>2a. Were you still getting definitions &amp; program updates for Symantec AntiVirus (SAV) when you replaced it with the Bit Defender application in 2006?</p>
<p>2b. Please confirm that you uninstalled SAV before you installed the Bit Defender application.</p>
<p>3a. Had your Bit Defender subscription <em>already expired</em> by the time you replaced it with McAfee Total Protection in 2010?</p>
<p>3b. Please confirm that you uninstalled&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bit Defender application&nbsp;before you installed McAfee Total Protection.</p>
<p>4. When (exact date, preferably) does your current McAfee Total Protection subscription expire?</p>
<p>5. Is there even a remote possibility that a McAfee or a Norton free-trial came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it back in 2003?</p>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Assuming all is well with your computer, an update is not literally installed unless it's listed in Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • At this point, it would&nbsp;<em>appear </em>that all is well with your computer so I'm keeping in mind the First Rule of Computing for the time being:
<em>If it ain't broke, don't fix it!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • That being said, the three-month &amp; one-month delays in getting two critical security updates installed certainly raises a red flag or two in my book so we'll continue to look into it.</p>

<h3> alexussalazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combine Audio file and Video file in Windows Movie Maker 2012&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a video but I recorded dialogue&nbsp;separately . I've imported the dialogue and synced it with the video but now I want to cut and edit and rearrange but when I do that the audio gets all messed up. Is there a way that I can merge the audio file and video
 file so when I move/cut/split it will all do it together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked up ways to do it and someone told me to highlight them both and then click "clip" and then "combine" but I can't find the "clip" option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since you have synced up the video and audio in a project, I would immediately save that as a new movie. That new movie will be written to a new file with the video and audio combined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can start another project using the new movie as the source and you can make your trims, splits, cuts, etc. as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be done in the original project but it will be a bit of a pain to try and keep things in sync. You'd essentially have to manually make the same splits/trims/cuts to both tracks.</p>

<p>I bought a Surface Go about 3-4 months ago , and I used a keyboard for turn up/down a audio all the times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today I use a button that is with a body, it can't turn down the volume anymore. How can I fix this or is it in a warranty or not ? 😭😭</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks for bringing this up to Surface Community. I'm sorry to hear about what happen, possibly this is a software or a hardware issue that you are having. Microsoft provides 1 year Manufacturer warranty for each Surface devices; As long as
 this is not a physical damage we can definitely take advantage of the standard warranty. But if you process exchange&nbsp; and found out by our Service center that it cause by dropped then the only option is to do an out of warranty exchange that will cost you.
 $249.00</span></p>

    <title>How can I change my settings for Windows Updates to not automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bridgett_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change my settings for Windows Updates to not automatically restart my computer for me&#63;</h2>
                    On my old computer, I had the option to delay restart for a few hours when it warned me that it needed to install updates.&nbsp; Now it just warns me that it'll restart in 15 minutes and does so while I frantically try to find a way to delay it.&nbsp; It shut me
 down while I was on my third disk of doing a Recovery Media Creation... boy was I fuming.&nbsp; This is a new computer and my first time using Windows 8... I can't seem to find things as easily...<br />

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the clean boot method mentioned above with no success. I scanned the entire PC with Norton Anti-Virus and didn't find any problems. The latest software I installed was Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. I am able to log into my account with Safe Mode
 without the duplicating key issue, it only seems to be a problem in normal mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Automatically switch on to stronger Wi-Fi connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automatically switch on to stronger Wi-Fi connection</h2>
                    <p>In 2017, a post was made asking this question and the responder agreed it would be a good idea but wasn't active at the time.&nbsp; In 2019, is there an automatic wifi switching to working internet providers (e.g. when active wifi stops providing data transmission)?&nbsp;
 If not in Windows, can this be enabled by other software, considering google Android &amp; Apple ios does this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2017 post:</p>
<p>Is there any way that i can cofigure my pc to automatically switch to a different wifi network if the current one stops providing internet connection?</p>
<p>I have 3 wifi networks at my place but none of them have a hundred percent uptime(wifi keeps broadcasting without internet) so i just want it to switch to a different one which has internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>***<em>Original Title: still no auto wifi&nbsp; switch upon loss of internet connection?***</em></p>

<p><span>Hi Joe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be achieved by enabling the
<strong>Roaming Aggressiveness </strong>for your <strong>Wi-Fi adapter. Roaming Aggressiveness
</strong>alters the signal strength threshold at which your Wi-Fi adapter starts scanning for another candidate AP. I suggest you to try the steps listed below and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click the Windows icon on the taskbar and choose <strong>Device Manager.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Expand <strong>Network Adapters </strong>and right click on your <strong>Wi-Fi adapter.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Choose <strong>Properties </strong>and click on <strong>Advanced </strong>tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Under <strong>Property, </strong>click on <strong>Roaming Aggressiveness </strong>
and on the right pane set it to the highest value.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Exit <strong>Device Manager </strong>and try automatic connection to see if it works.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            Previously, when i tried to shut it down the regular way it would blink and the screen icons would turn grey, like it was gonna try to shut down-this it would just blink back up to the color screen like i had not even done anything...The shut-down on 'task
 mgr' does not work, either...I cannot 'restart' it when a program downloads and needs to be restarted to take effect AND NOW when i type the format you gave me &nbsp;shutdown -s , it will not work...the box comes up and counts down the 30 seconds and then disappears,
 and the computer does nothing, just sits there like i did nothing to it...
<div>The only way i can t it shut it down is to just turn it off...</div>
<div><br />
<div>any ideas? &nbsp;thanks for your help!</div>

<p>I would never use Norton, but that is my choice, it sometimes does not agree with windows.</p>

    <title>SyncToy error&#58; cannot read from the source - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristinelise  say:</h3>
<h2>            SyncToy error&#58; cannot read from the source</h2>
                    I am using SyncToy to copy files from my D drive to an external drive. I am using the "echo" setting, which is equivalent to Robocopy "Mirror" (if I understand correctly). Everything goes okay, but for&nbsp;13 error messages that say "cannot read from the source"
 and list the target path as either&nbsp;"$recycle.bin\S-1-5-21...etc",&nbsp; "found.000",&nbsp;&nbsp;"MSOCache",&nbsp; or "System Volume Information".&nbsp;I don't understand what this means. I have simply entered my target path as the external ("G") drive--where did all this other stuff
 come from? It appears that all the files have copied and appear on the ext drive.

<h2>            Video on new RCA tablet</h2>
                    We just got a new RCA tablet. I installed the Skype app, and tried it out. It works, I can make calls and talk to people, but, although the permission for the camera is on, there is no video, and I can't find any way to turn it on. I asked RCA, and they
 said to ask Skype (of course). Any ideas?

    <title>Under Win 8, how do I get a correct choice of 1280x720 resolution for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Under Win 8, how do I get a correct choice of 1280x720 resolution for my Sanyo PLV-Z2&#63; Worked fine under XP.</h2>
                    Overall I am happy with Windows 8 (after classic shell anyhow). Faster, better driver detection, etc. Except for my projector...<br />
<br />
My primary monitor is detected correctly. However my projector, a Sanyo PLV-Z2 is not detected correctly, and does not show a 1280x720 selection for the screen resolution. It is connected via DVI, and I realize that there was a problem with it returning the
 wrong info. However with XP I was able to override that and it worked just fine at the correct resolution. Now it is stuck with a limited number of choices, of which Windows picks 1024x768 for me (not right).<br />
<br />
This is on Windows 8 64 Pro with an ATI x1800 display card with the 8.593.100.0 driver dated 2/10/2010<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Bryan<br />

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, I understand that you are not able to adjust the screen resolution to 1280 x 720 using Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to tell you that <span>the minimum and maximum resolution on your computer is dependent on the capabilities of your hardware. It can only be adjusted between the values Windows provides when changing the resolution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows Apps require a minimum resolution of 1024 x 768.</span> </li><li><span>The Apps Snap feature requires a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I would suggest you to contact the Projector manufacturer to adjust the screen resolution on it if available.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any other Windows related issue, reply to us and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

</p>
<p>That is correct - for my SECOND "monitor" - A 120" screen 720p projector.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None. Whitebox with ATI video card, as explained above. Quad core AMD box I upgraded from XP, added 16GB of RAM, new SSD, etc. Meets all minimum specs easily.<br />

</li></ul>
<p>I think you mean - tile "METRO" apps require a minimum resolution...&nbsp;&nbsp; No problem here as I don't use them - even on the main monitor. But this projector is for watching movies as a home theater PC. Did Microsoft seriously forget that people use computers
 for something besides sliding around tiles and posting on Facebook? You don't HAVE to have 1080p to watch movies!<br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;&gt;I would suggest you to contact the Projector manufacturer to adjust the screen resolution on it if available.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY? The correct NATIVE resolution is 1280x720 - that is a STANDARD called 720p -&nbsp; what MOST projectors STILL use. The only CORRECT way to use it is at 1280x720. Anything else is simply WRONG.<br />
</p>
<br />
Seriously? Is this the only answer answer.microsoft.com can give?<br />
<br />
I came here for a technical answer - such as go into the registry and change this to allow the USER (who is not an idiot) to choose the correct resolution for THEIR hardware. Sigh...<br />

            That does not work with this card, as it is using legacy drivers and is not supported by CCC. It does manage my CPUs however... (rolling eyes).<br />
<br />
Does anyone know for a FACT that newer ATI/AMD cards will allow this resolution under Windows 8? I am willing to upgrade (silly as the hardware does what it needs to do - play movies) - but only if I know it will work before purchasing it.<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
<br />
I will say this - support spent an hour on the phone with me trying to make this work. Unfortunately - they just rehashed everything I had already tried and are still limited by Microsoft's poor screen resolution design choice in 8 causing this problem and
 had no suggestions. They took note of the problem and suggested there may be some patch in the future to allow smaller monitors on non-primary screens.<br />

<br />
Maybe CCC is the wrong tool then.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually have AMD's Vision Control Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as I know I am using the same thing in W7.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is actually giving me better control over my wide screen attached monitor than over my built-in
 display but I'm still working on the possibilities it provides.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. by dropping resolution down from 100% I managed to enable some scaling on my Tablet and I think that this has allowed swiping from the top to start working more reliably (e.g. at the cost
 of 32 pixels vertically.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still not satisfied with my swiping from the side UX so I need to find some way of scaling in that direction which doesn't cost as much as it seems that it might (a lot more than just 32 pixels if&nbsp;I drop down to the next defined
 resolution.)

            <p>For anyone looking... I swapped the ATI card with a borrowed a Nvidia GTX275 and loaded the latest drivers (310.90).<br />
<br />
The custom resolution for 1280x720 59Hz under their change resolution tab in the control panel works great with my projector, so newer cards will definitely work right with Windows 8 at this resolution and current drivers (at least with Nvidia cards).<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>You will need to contact the manufacturer of that device to see if this is possible on a Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>Here are some links to the manufacturers support.</p>

<h2>            Is it safe to install windows live essentials before my own windows update does it and will it mess up again&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it safe to install windows live essentials before my own windows update does it and will it mess up again? I have to ask because I don't want to re-install my whole operating system again. My movie maker got messed up and gave me error code after
 error code and over all made me quite upset! So I re-installed my whole windows 7 pro operating system. Now I want to update my movie maker to the newest updated version...but I'm scared to do it for fear of a dll file corrupting like it did before. Any advise
 or help before I do this would be truly appreciated!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Hello J.Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I understand that you want to make sure that Windows Update won't mess up with your programs again. Let's see what we can do. For your question, yes, it is safe to install the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>latest version of Windows Essentials
</strong></a>before you install Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are having issues with error codes, we need to fix it so that the issue will not occur again when you install the programs and Windows Updates. Please provide us the exact error (dll file corrupting)&nbsp;that you've encountered in Movie Maker so that
 we could determine the possible cause of your issue and provide you the best solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p><strong>Hi Helene,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; Yes I have resolved the issue completely and I was able to figure out and get it working now and for any reason in the future. I downloaded what is called WLARP and ran it; then rebooted; then re-installed Windows Live Essentials using the standalone
 Windows Live installer and finally, it did a proper install. When I then tried the individual programs they all worked and they picked up the original accounts settings, databases and preferences without a hitch.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*Note: This is the uninstaller for Windows Live Essentials 2011 that will completely remove ALL of the old and/or damaged Live Essentials Program so that a fresh install will work, almost no matter what. It can also be downloaded at:

    <title>Window 10 won&#59;t boot on H170 Pro Gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vireakbothsea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 won&#59;t boot on H170 Pro Gaming</h2>
                    <p>So I've just finished building my PC and everything is up and running. I have the new Windows 10 OS install from the USB which i got from the local shops. When i turn on my PC, i enter into the BIOS settings and change the boot options so that it
 boots from the USB first. I even try overriding the boot and making it boot from the USB. It then starts to do something with a dash in the top left corner, and then the dash quickly flickers from that position to another position on my monitor a few times,
 and then just returns to BIOS. I can't even see the windows logo or anything. My computer is recognising the usb with the windows 10 on it but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an ASUS h170 pro gaming motherboard. Any help with this issue would be much appreciated. Post a response if you need any more details regarding my build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: This is a brand new PC that i just built, so it's a clean install and i have had no previous OS on the system.</p>

            Could you provide some details, such as the name of application? <br />
<br />
Some of my devices and applications are not working, what should I do?<br />
<br />
A: If your internet connection is working in Windows 7, I suggest you try obtaining the drivers through Windows Update. Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Windows Update &gt; Turn on Windows Update. A list of available updates will then be downloaded, you will have
 the option to view them, do so and check off the appropriate drivers or software patches you need and click Install. You can also check the manufacturer’s website for patches, updated drivers or to simply find out about Windows 7 support for the particular
 product.

    <title>Installed program list - wrong install dates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrypinvg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed program list - wrong install dates</h2>
                    <p>Is this another consequence of the recent flawed Win 10 update(s)?<br />
<br />
In my list of 214 installed programs (Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features)&nbsp; about 150 are shown with install dates of 21/1/2018. That's the date I installed version 1709, including buggy KB4056892, which I later uninstalled.<br />
<br />
Same wrong data using Revo Uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to restore that valuable information please?<br />

            Exactly. that update was basically a new install and shows this in that location.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you go to the programs or programs(86)&nbsp;folders and look at some of the folder properties, they will show the actual date the folders or programs were installed.

<p>Are you referring to installed windows updates or installed apps in this location,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to say that I have seen this happen many times, but in time, eventually the correct dates will show. Or missing installed date and other info will appear. You do have view mode on "DETAILS" correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding C:\Program Files and PF(86)&nbsp;to indexer may help restore the dates faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verify that folders are&nbsp;ready for indexing in folder properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it is odd. I wondered about it long ago after major Windows update or creators pack&nbsp;when my installed dates, versions and publisher, etc&nbsp;were missing or incorrect dates. Then eventually the were all there and correct.

<p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change in the install dates is tied to the Feature Upgrade when the version 1709 was installed on your computer. This feature is by-design in Windows 10. However, if you want to have the install dates of the program lists retained when performing a feature
 upgrade on Windows 10, we encourage you to submit your query using the Feedback Hub. You can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new issue. When you submit a feedback item, we gather additional details and information about your issue that will
 help determine what’s causing it and address it. Feedback items regularly receive Microsoft responses on the submissions in the Feedback app so you can see what we are doing about your feedback. Please revisit frequently to see the status of your feedback
 items.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On a Windows 10 device, search for “<strong>Feedback Hub</strong>” in <strong>
Cortana </strong>search, then launch the app.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Feedback </strong>in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</li><li>Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking <strong>Begin monitoring
</strong>(or <strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form; <strong>Stop monitoring
</strong>when you’re done.</li><li>Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>My feedback </strong>at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).</li><li>Open the item you submitted, then click <strong>Share</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Copy </strong>link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/&lt;unique link&gt;).</li></ol>

            Thank you for your response. Some programs have to be reinstalled by Windows, after a major version upgrade. Therefore, will the install date reflect this. Were you able to post this to our Feedback Hub?<br />

Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

 you guys do anything about and ban their console, or their account, or a IP ban? Like WTF? You guys do nothing to fix the problem and I have called 10+ times about this. You guys do NOTHING ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>The enforcement team does take care of people like that. Otherwise there wouldn't be a suspension forum -
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It's also up to the developers to fix their games so people can't do things like that.</p>
