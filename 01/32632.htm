<h2>            Aprils Punchcard completion</h2>
                    
<p>I have completed all the punchcards but under points pending, bonus rewards, and VIP rewards I have nothing pending. I know it is supposed to take anywhere from may 15th to the 30th to actually receive the rewards but I was under the impression that my rewards
 should show up as pending. Anyone know if they should be pending or will they just show up in my account on the 15th later this month?</p>

<p>Remember the Live Rewards program is managed by a different company, and not Microsoft.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That's why there is a different support forum if you have problems/questions.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Right from the Punchcard FAQ:</p>
<p>+ I completed a Punchcard! How do I claim my Reward?</p>
<p>A. If the Reward is Microsoft Points, <b>they will appear under Pending on your MyRewards page by the 15th of the following month.</b> If the Reward is anything other than Microsoft Points, an email will be sent to your contact email listed here with instructions
 to redeem your Reward. The Rewards for completion of a Punchcard will vary with each Punchcard offer. Rewards will not be provided during the Punchcard offer period.</p>
<p>-</p>
All i can say is sit tight for and see what happens around the middle of the month.

<h2>            Printers &#40;FAX and HP Universal PCL6&#41; showing offline after reboot for about 2 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 1 of 10 times all of the connected printers (FAX and HP Universal PCL6) are showing offline for about 2 minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already disabled SNMP for the HP driver and set service "Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode Driver Framework" from Manual to Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is be used in an environment where the user will print a report soon after startup of the system. When
<span><span>the</span> <span>printer is offline</span><span>,
<span><span>the</span> <span>printer is offline</span><span>,
</span></span>this will confuse the user (it is a device used by users without good PC knowledge).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your feedback!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Glad to know that it is working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can set it to manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Font Cache Service optimizes performance of applications by caching commonly used font data. Applications will start this service if it is not already running. It can be disabled, though doing so will degrade application performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways you are not stopping the service from running so it if fine until&nbsp;if you are not facing any issues with any programs or apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In future, if you have any issues related to Windows, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            D&#58; drive full, but no files found.</h2>
                    I've been searching for a solution for this problem for a while now and can't quite find what i'm looking for. Every now and again I receive notifications that my D: drive is full and that I need to clear some space. The problem is that when I go to clear
 space and solve the problem, there is nothing there already. I then went into settings and storage to see what exactly was taking up all of this space, but when I click on the "other" folder, there are no files to be seen. I've already tried cleaning and clearing
 up space but nothing seems to work. Any help would be tremendous.

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and we’ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive D is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove.  In this example, you would type: remove letter=D
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.

            Try this fix by DaveM:
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal: 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />diskpart 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />select volume X 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />remove letter=X 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and the problem will be resolved . . .

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; 711 Remote Access Service Manager could not be started</h2>
                    <p>Hi Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dependent services mentioned here before, as telephony, plug and play, are started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not running are the</p>
<p>- Remote Auto Connection Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remote Access Connection Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>which I am unable to start "1068 dependency service or group failed to start"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled avast to no avail, and reinstalled it meantime.</p>
<p>Yes, it might be some Program (virusscanner, netmanager) or whatever which may have caused the trouble in the first place, though, its surprising that no fix has been provided yet by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an online worker and need to have this fixed asap, otherwise I need to buy a new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be a joke, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response from our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The common dependency service for "Remote Access Connection Manager" and "Remote Access Auto Connection Manager" is "Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service".</p>
<p>2. Make sure which ever service you are trying to start; check the properties of that service and then go to the dependency tab and make sure that the services listed under "This service depends on the following system components" are ale started.</p>
<p>The following are the dependency services of "Remote Access Connection Manager":</p>
<p>a. Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service</p>
<p>b. Telephony</p>
<p>c. Plug and Play</p>
<p>d. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</p>
<p>e. DCOM Server Process Launcher</p>
<p>f. RPC Endpoint Mapper</p>
<p>Make sure the above services are started.</p>
<p>Make sure you try to start the dependency services of Remote Access Auto Connection Manager Service as well.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Error code 80073AFC after attempted installation of win vista service pack 1</h2>
                    <p><span>I have not been able to install win vista service pack 1 on my pc (via
</span><span>KB936330). The error code that I get after a failed installation process is 80073AFC. After consulting the help page for this error, I did what was recommended. First, I ran :</span></p>
<p><span>Cmd /c ren %systemroot%\System32\Spupdsvc.exe Spupdsvc.old</span></p>
<p><span>After that, I used Microsoft Fixit to verify that everything is fine with the windows update process.</span></p>
<p><span>After these changes, I tried to install the service pack again. In vain. The installation process appears to be OK, until I am prompted to restart. Now, halfway during the update process, I get a message that the installation
 failed and that the changes will be reverted again.</span></p>
<p><span>Would appreciate any help and tips on what I should do now.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Disclaimer for disabling or uninstalling Antivirus:</span></u></b><b><span>
</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable

    <title>I do not have an administrator account on Windows 10 home only have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howard_35_78  say:</h3>
<h2>            I do not have an administrator account on Windows 10 home only have Guest account witch is password protected</h2>
                    <p>HI I am have a small issue the other night I was trying to find a way to hopefully not have to login into windows 10 so I typed in my search box&nbsp;&nbsp;Netplwiz and pushed enter. &nbsp;I took the check mark out of the box that had something like password has to be
 put in account and then I pushed apply and ok and then a message came up saying that their was only two ways to login into windows 10 local account and administrator so then I pushed ok and closed the window and shut down my windows 10 computer for the night.
 &nbsp;Then the next day I restarted my computer and logged into windows and noticed when it got to the desktop that my volume icon in the lower taskbar had an x on it so then I went to device manger only to be greeted with a message saying that I cannot make any
 changes because I am only a Guest &nbsp;and I need to be an administrator to make changes to device manager. &nbsp;I went to user account in control panel and I only have one account on my desktop computer and it is the Guest account witch is password protected. &nbsp;I
 did try going through settings and Recovery and went into advanced and their I was able to type my password for administrator and go through that way. &nbsp;I should mention that when I go to install an application I get the uac pop that says do you want the application
 to make changes to your pc. &nbsp;I cannot click on the yes button because it is grayed out and the no button is the only button that I can click on. &nbsp;on the uac it says that I have to type an administrator password. &nbsp;I do not have an administrator account or password
 currently. &nbsp;thanks.</p>

            <p>HI I just wanted to update everyone on this continuing issue. &nbsp;I did start the sfc scannow and push enter but I did not finish this procedure because I had to leave so I exited out of the sfc window and went to power and shut down my desktop computer out
 of safe mode. &nbsp;When I got back home I started my windows 10 home desktop and my computer did not go to the desktop now it only goes to the administer lock screen below Administrator it says account has been disabled. &nbsp;Please see your administrator. &nbsp;When I
 push the ok button the screen flashes several times and if I keep pushing the ok button the white spinning wheel will start rolling and the word welcome will come up the white circle will go around for a few minutes and then the ok button will come back with
 the words your account is disabled. &nbsp;Please see your administrator. &nbsp;I should also mention that their are no icons in the left or right corner of the lock screen. &nbsp;I cannot get into safe mode any longer and I have tried lots of commands with no luck at all.
 &nbsp;I am hopeful for any help offered please Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks Microsoft community.</p>

            <p>HI Jessen P in my case I could not go back into the built in administrator account what would happen is that I could get to the built in administrator account screen but I would only get the message below the administrator it would say that this account
 has been disabled. &nbsp;Please contact your administrator. &nbsp;The little small circle would turn but then it would never get back into administrator account or into safe mode at all. &nbsp;I did take my hp desktop back to the store and the tech guy told me that he would
 have to do a complete reset of the computer and go back to the factory settings and the operating system that came with the desktop but the tech guy did tell me he would reinstall windows 10 back on my computer for me.</p>

    <title>What license are Windows XP icons under&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>   say:</h3>
<h2>            What license are Windows XP icons under&#63;</h2>
                    I know a few "open-source" DOS desktops (intended for use with MS-DOS or FreeDOS) that use ripped icons.
<div>SEALsystem.sf.net - SEAL desktop</div>
<div>SkyfireOS.blogspot.com - SkyfireOS uses OpenPine, a derivative of SEAL</div>
<div>oZone - awkward GUI with its own application API</div>
<div>There might be others, too.</div>
<div>So, what license are XP's icons under? (you can get DOSbox if you want to run any of those desktops, SkyfireOS "Windows Native" version is OpenPine with DOSbox.</div>
<div>In oZone, folder icon was recolored - but not in SEAL.</div>
<div>Should I report those desktops for some action to be taken by MS?</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
ID41 with no Bug_Check - The main cause of this issue as you have described is hardware related :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2028504/windows-kernel-event-id-41-error-the-system-has-rebooted-without-clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2028504/windows-kernel-event-id-41-error-the-system-has-rebooted-without-clean</a>
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Over-Clocking -&gt; <strong>best to reset ALL to the defaults especially while troubleshooting</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Memory (check thoroughly as indicated below).<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Power Supply (see below to ensure you have enough power).<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Over-heating - even if the overall temps are with-in specs a single component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat and fault at a lower temp. Try adding a fan blowing into the case to reduce the effects of heat even more
 than the cooler usually does. Of course ensure all built-in fans are running.<br />
<br />
====================================================</p>
<p><br />
After checking determining the wattage of the power supply you will then need to check the requirements of the motherboard and devices. Usually, the video card is one of the&nbsp;major power users.<br />
<br />
How do I determine how big my power supply is?<br />

<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Pues amigo, los parches se aplican automaticamente siempre que tu tengas suficiente capacidad en la tarjeta de memoria o disco duro, y siempre que tu aceptes la actualizacion, si no se aplican automaticamente, ve a bazar de juegos, selecciona F2010 y ahi
 busca "Complementos y extras" seguramente encuentres ahí el parche.</p>
<p>Espero haber servido de ayuda. un saludete.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Pixel format not accelerated&#34; and unable to update Video card on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to get Minecraft on my computer, but fortunately I decided to try the demo first. I tried to play it, but when the launcher tried to start the game, I get an error message: "&nbsp;Pixel format not accelerated"</p>
<p>I've tried to update the driver with the Settings&gt;Windows Update method, but it says that all drivers are up to date. I then uninstalled the driver, as some Windows site suggested, and that would force the Windows update app to download the most recent one.
 It did not work, and I have any ideas as to what to try next.</p>
<p>I recently updated from Windows 7, running on an Hp Pavilion a6157c TV PC. In the picture below is my system info:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/071a8faf-77bb-4e93-86ae-96d9dc6e9731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/071a8faf-77bb-4e93-86ae-96d9dc6e9731" /></a></p>
<p>This is essentially all I know, if more info is needed to solve this problem, please ask for it and I would gladly provide it.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Check 0x7F: UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>0x00000008</strong> , or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be handled serially,
 and in this situation the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A kernel stack overflow. This overflow occurs when a guard page is hit, and the kernel tries to push a trap frame. Because there is no stack left, a stack overflow results, causing the double fault.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A hardware problem.</p>
<p>First, please update you network card driver:</p>
<p>Image path: \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\<strong>yk62x64.sys</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image name: yk62x64.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mon Feb 23 16:02:27 2009</strong></p>
<p>If this doen't solve it, it may caused by ZoneAlarm. I can see that you have it installed, so remove it please. If you still get crashes, configure your Windows to create a kernel dump [1] and upload the zipped dump (C:\Windows\memory.dmp) to your SkyDrive.<br />

            <p>Hi Bill,<br />
</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>2. Have you updates all the drivers for the PC?</p>
<p><br />
Follow these methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Make sure no programs are running in the background when you trying to rate the computer.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 2:</strong><br />
Also, update graphics card driver.<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 3:<br />
</strong>Temporarily disable any antivirus that are running in background and check again.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></font></p>
