<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 10 and no longer seem to have an operating system</h2>
                    <p>I foolishly decided to upgrade my perfect-working computer from Windows 8 to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Started it off, got about 40% complete and left for lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came back, it seemed to be in 'sleep mode', monitors were shut down, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I clicked the mouse
 and the monitor lights came on, and I had a cursor and nothing else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I can see a cursor and move it around, clicking any button on the mouse has no effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The keyboard has zero affect no matter what I press.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only option was to shut down
 the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it goes to boot, I get the Alienware logo and can get into the&nbsp;bios part of it, but can't ever get to the part of the boot where I can choose windows safe-mode or anything like that (F8, F12, ,tried all of the F#s individually.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never see a windows
 logo or any messages at all after the bios, but the blank screens stay there and a cursor eventually appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't a clue in the world what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm begging for help from anyone at all.</p>

            <p>Method 1:&nbsp; This was an upgrade and there was no installation DVD or USB with Windows 10 to boot from.</p>
<p>Method 2: Check disk did it's usual nothing at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use a recovery disk that came with my Alienware to reinstall 8.1 (obviously losing all programs and everything).&nbsp;&nbsp; That installation does not reboot the computer, so the operating system comes up and appears to function normally.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if I reboot
 the computer, it will not boot at all, but acts exactly as it's acted since the moment I tried to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happens every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm convinced that Windows 10 ruined my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's one year 2 months old, and from Alienware, and it had no issues whatsoever until the day I tried to use the upgrade that I was notified was ready now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was actually looking forward to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm looking forward to the Apple computer I'm going to be forced to buy.</p>

            You can get your computer working again if you want to.&nbsp; You could use a boot disk to back-up you files to external media first but then you might have to restore your computer to its factory state or re-install Windows 8.1; that's the option of last resort.

            <p>The recovery disk I used essentially did restore the computer, but then it still won't boot. &nbsp; &nbsp;It installs 8.1 and the computer appears to come up and work fine.....but as soon as you reboot, it goes past the bios and simply stops attempting to boot and
 you see nothing but a blank screen. &nbsp; Windows did something in that upgrade to stop the computer from being able to boot from the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i haven't lost my files because I'm able to copy everything to an external drive. &nbsp; I just can't reboot, or install patches or upgrades or programs that require reboots</p>

<p>Then you were not upgrading it properly.&nbsp; You would get this situation if you boot from bootable media and try to install Windows 10 that way, but that's not an upgrade, that's a clean install&nbsp; - and a clean install won't activate on a machine that has not
 previously been upgraded.</p>

<p>I literally took the machine out of the box, hooked it up, finished setting up Windows 8.1 (giving it your email, etc), then got a message FROM Windows telling me I could upgrade, went to their site and started the upgrade from their webpage where it spent
 a long time downloading files and doing setup stuff....right until it stopped to tell me that my copy of Windows 8.1 was not activated, and asked me for a product key. Dell tells me they stopped sending product keys years ago as they are no longer needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no bootable media involved and I don't have a copy of Windows 10. &nbsp; This was an upgrade done properly, and a bug in the Windows upgrade. &nbsp; Dell had heard of it happening before when I talked to their tech support. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured I had a much better chance of a clean upgrade from a brand new machine. &nbsp; Wrong.</p>

            <p>Like all major manufacturers, Dell activation is linked to the 'BIOS' so there isn't a key as such.&nbsp; Had you checked your copy of &nbsp;Windows 8.1 it should have shown as activated and your Windows 10 should have activated after the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probability and certainty are different things.&nbsp; I'm sure you had a better chance of a clean upgrade from a brand new machine but manifestly it wasn't a certainty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Dell Support cannot instruct you on how to reset your computer to its as-supplied state then you will have to return it under warranty and get them to do it for you.&nbsp; It could be a hardware fault after all.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            media player dvd decoder</h2>
                    Windows Vista Business (x86 SP2, Toshiba laptop) Media Player requires DVD decoder to play a small DVD burnt on Windows 7 (PC), yet Windows 7 Media Player plays the same video file burnt on the same type of DVD disc on the same Windows Vista.&nbsp; And my other
 laptop running on Windows 7 plays both of the DVDs fine. <br />
Is Vista Windows Media Player lacking the DVD decoder that Windows 7 already comes with?
<br />
Is a DVD decoder a 3rd party software that works with Windows Media Center?<br />

are Home Premium and Ultimate.<br />

See the following link:<br />

<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>Always, hide labels</strong>. </em></span><em><span>This is the default setting. Each app appears as a single, unlabeled button, even when multiple windows for that app are open.</span></em></li><li><span><em><strong>When taskbar is full</strong>. This setting shows each window as an individual, labeled button. When the taskbar becomes crowded, apps with multiple open windows collapse into a single app button. Tap or click the button to see a list
 of the windows that are open.</em></span></li><li><span><em><strong>Never</strong>. This setting shows each window as an individual, labeled button and never combines them, no matter how many windows are open. As more apps and windows open, buttons get smaller, and eventually the buttons will scroll.</em></span></li></ul>

            <p>I don't refer to combining tasks. Even if are not combined, tasks of the same app are grouped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"you cannot take just one task out of a group."</p>
<p>That is the answer.</p>
<p>And should be implemented an option to ungroup tasks.</p>

            <p>you can reorder the groups on the taskbar by dragging them, the tasks within the groups are in the order that they were opened, (as far as I know) they cant be reordered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rey Cam's advice to use the feedback hub to suggest it to the windows development team is your best bet, maybe they will build the function into future builds.</p>

<p>7+ taskbar tweaker</p>
<p>with this little app you can change the position of a task in a group or ungroup all tasks of the same application</p>
<p>Microsoft should learn from this app</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Maintenance in progress never ending</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time posting here so forgive me if I don't include all the neccesary information right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As the title says I'm using windows 8.1 64 bit on a brand new Lenovo yY50 laptop. I've upgraded to a Samsung EVO 840 SSD and 16GB of ram and have since been having my Windows Maintenance constantly in progress. I'm talking for days, it just doesn't end.
 I eventually give up and restart or shut down my laptop because I don't want to have it on all the time. I had initially problems with updating windows to the latest update (KB3000850) as well as the maintenance never ending, so I did a full refresh which
 solved my updating problems, but the maintenance forever in progress is still ongoing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've googled for answers to this and found most people just saying to disable the automatic maintenance, but I'd rather try to figure out what the problem is first. If anyone has any insight in to troubleshooting this problem that would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>If you're still reading this thread, I want to be as much help as possible because I don't have the strongest feeling Windows 10 is going to fix this issue since it's framework is essentially Windows 8, from what I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few things from what I posted and got feedback. Reading some posts I noticed that, even if you disable those in the Task Scheduler by any means, Windows overrides the settings and enables them again. What I did, as well as a few others, was exported
 Idle Maintenance and Regular Maintenance making a backup of both individually. Then delete Idle Maintenance and restart your PC for the changes to take affect. Making a backup of Regular Maintenance is necessary due to the changes when the PC is restarted
 after the other is deleted. This will ensure that when your PC goes idle, maintenance won't go in a loop and keep running. Everything else will go according to plan if you have maintenance scheduled, and it will run as normal.</p>

    <title>Windows not asking me for log-in credentials when mapping network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deetree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows not asking me for log-in credentials when mapping network drive</h2>
                    <p>So I have an annoying problem with accessing a drive attached to a router. Here's my set-up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 PC (SMB 1 installed)</p>
<p>2. Router with hard drive attached</p>
<p>3. Nvidia Shield TV running a Plex Server</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way my Windows machine can access the drive is if I have the SMB share on the router set to "allow guest access." If I don't have that setting on, Windows cannot map to it or access it. It doesn't show a credentials popup, so there's no place to
 enter login info.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be okay if the Nvidia shield could access the drive while it's in guest mode. It can't the only way Shield can access it, if I have guess access set to off on the router. But of course, if I do that, I can't map or access the drive on my Windows
 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you see my dilemma. The question is, how can I get Windows to show the login popup when I try to access the network drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts/ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:</p>
<p>* I've added the router's IP info to the Hosts file which got me as far as being able to access the drive at all (when set to guest access on the router)</p>

            I dont know, but maybe look in the control panel,&nbsp; Credentials / Windows Credentials for your drive login/password... perhaps you will see something / perhaps delete it there and then it might pop the question for the router/drive login/password.

            Nice idea: never knew about the credentials management panel. Unfortunately, deleting relevant entries didn't work. Think I'm just going to return the Nvidia Shield and give up this quest.&nbsp;

<h2>            Please wait while we install a system update</h2>
                    I found a bunch of system updates like firmware, video etc. I had Windows update download them and it said to restart. I did and now it's stuck on the screen that shows the white Windows logo with a progress bar under it. It's got a tiny sliver of red
 showing barely any progress. Below that we see "Please wait while we install a system update" It's been this way for over an hour now. How long should this take and if it's stuck, what can I do to fix this?

<p>Hi Kapurcell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sometimes the logo stays on the screen while Surface updates are installing. Large updates may take up longer than expected, so you may need to wait while they install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's more than an hour and still the device does not boot in to Windows, force shutdown the device.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10 seconds), then release the power button.</li><li><span><span><span>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Microsoft logo.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If that doesn't work, use this shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.
</span></span><span><span>Press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this takes about 20 seconds), then release the power button.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If force the device to shut down does not work. Try to force shutdown the device again and restart.
</span></span></span></span><span>After two consecutive failed attempts to start Windows, the Recovery menu will appear.</span><span><span><span><span>Then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>See advanced repair options</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.
 Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Go back to the previous version</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup / Automatic repair.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If <span><span><span><span>Startup / Automatic repair does not work, choose <strong>
System Restore. </strong></span></span></span></span><span>This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might be causing the problem. Restoring from a restore point won‚Äôt affect your personal files.

            To help understand your svchost.exe Processes and what is running beneath them, read this article and you will be smarter than the average bear:<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial129.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial129.html</a><br />
<br />
You might be able to get some clues using about what is going with your svchost.exe Processes using Task Manager and maybe figure it out.<br />
<br />
You will always be able to figure out what is going with your svchost.exe Processes if you use Process Explorer.<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer so you can see what is "really" running on your system, especially behind those multiple svchosts Processes you see running in Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a><br />
<br />
You'll like Process Explorer when you get the hang of it.&nbsp; Process Explorer is the Windows Task Manager on steroids.
<br />
<br />
Process Explorer installs nothing so it will not slow your system down since it only runs on demand.
<br />
<br />
Process Explorer may look a little intimidating at first since it presents so much information, but you will start to get to like the way it works when you are looking for performance problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can even tell PE that you want it to be your new default
 "Task Manager" from now on.&nbsp; You can still run the original Task Manger too.<br />
<br />
Once you get Process Explorer running, expand the columns, drag the corners of the display to make it bigger, etc. so you can see the most information as possible in the window.&nbsp; Now you can really see everything that is running on the system.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of my poor system when I use Process Explorer:<br />
<a href="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/2567/processexplorer.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/2567/processexplorer.png<br />
</a><br />
The CPU column is usually the most interesting to get started with performance issues - who is using the most?<br />
<br />
It is okay and normal to have multiple svchost,exe Processes running.&nbsp; Important XP Services are actually running under the svchost.exe Processes. Sometimes there is just one XP Service running under a svchost.exe Process, sometimes there are several XP Services
 running under a svchost.exe Process.<br />
<br />
Sometimes malicious software will hide behind a svchost.exe Process since the malicious software knows you will not be able to spot it in Task Manager.&nbsp; It will hide behind a svchost.exe Process to fool you, but you can outsmart it.<br />
<br />
Malicious software can also disguise itself to appear to be a legitimate XP Process or it could hide under/behind other Processes that you see running in Task Manager so you cannot see it running.<br />
<br />
The malicious software would like to fool you into thinking that you need to use a System Restore Point, perform a Repair Install or reinstall your XP from scratch when you really don't have to.<br />
<br />
When looking at the display in Process Explorer, you would like the most CPU to be associated with System Idle Process.&nbsp; That is the "free time" on your system so the more free time it has, the better.
<br />
<br />
If you look at the performance graphs and see red spikes (or not) double click the graph in the top left corner to display the usage graph.&nbsp; Hover the mouse over any spikes to see what causes them.&nbsp; Even if the spike has already scrolled past in the display,
 you can still hover the mouse over the spike to see what caused it.&nbsp; You can also just wait for a spike to occur and then see what caused the spike.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think one of your svchost.exe processes is out of control or run amok, understand that some malicious software will hide itself as a process behind one of your several svchost.exe processes.&nbsp; All you will see in Task Manager is a svchost.exe process
 that has run amok.<br />
<br />
The malicious software knows that you will not be able to see it in Task Manager.&nbsp; The malicious software hopes that you will do something drastic like a use a Restore Point, perform a Repair Install, or even reinstall your XP from scratch.<br />
<br />
No matter what you are using for malware detection and removal do this first:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />

<p>I suddenly got the same problem. Not sure why it suddenly started happening or what the fix is. I've gotten all the latest updates, including drivers (which caused bitlocker to trip out) and it is still doing it.

<p>That was my plan as well but first I just wanted to apply the latest updates from Microsoft, just in case it was a but they noticed and fixed in the mean time.</p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What‚Äôs the model number of the computer?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have Windows 8 Developer preview, and want Windows 8 Pro, ready to clean install. But while browsing this form, found that I can't upgrade/install to Win 8 pro from Developer preview. But when I installed Win 8 upgrade assistance, it is allowing me to
 place order for Windows 8 Pro for Rs 1999.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also the ordering window is showing another check box for "Windows DVD" for Rs 1060. Does it mean Rs 1,999 doesn't contain installer that I can re-use for&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;in future??</div>
<div>Can you resolve my confusion?</div>

Buy a full version of an OS. For Windows 8 - you might get the OEM (I think thats 99.99 USD) licensed copy.

            Couple of things to check.
<br />First check your screensaver timeout, see link below.

<br />
<br />Second check your sleep and hibernation.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If your Power Options settings are set correctly at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power Options, then the next suspect is the screensaver which is mysteriously setting a 1 minute timeout to blank Screensaver when some Themes are chosen.  Check that now at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings.
<br />
<br />Otherwise it might be in the monitor so check it's settings buttons. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    My dad is running Windows Vista 32 bit Home Premium with email program Windows Mail<br />
When he opens Window Mail he gets the error<br />
<br />
<p><span>The message could not be sent. The authentication setting might not be correct for your outgoing e-mail [SMTP] server. For help solving this
 problem, go to Help, search for "Troubleshoot Windows Mail", and read the "I'm having problems sending e-mail" section. If you need help determining the proper server settings, please contact your e-mail service provider.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rejected e-mail address was 'mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'. Subject 'ref.nnnnnn/xxxx xxx', Account: 'pop.tools.sky.com', Server:

<br />
I have checked the Windows Mail Outbox and there is nothing in it<br />
<br />
He gets the error when he opens Windows Mail and he then just clicks Hide to continue<br />
Once he has opened Windows Mail he can send/Receive emails normally<br />
<br />
When he closes Windows Mail it asks him if he wants to send the emails in the Outbox but there are none<br />
<br />
Is this email still in a Windows Email file somewhere and how can he stop getting the message?<br />

<br />Click your Start Button, type charmap and hit Enter, that should find it
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />
<br />Scroll down the Aphabetical list of Applications on your Start Menu to W
<br />
<br />Expand Windows Accessories
<br />
<br />You should find that there
<br />
<br />For ease of access in the future, right click Character Map and choose 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />Then you will have a tile on your Start Menu for the Character Map<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75c79f64-139e-469a-8e3c-473497f6a56a?upload=true" />

                    <p>Ok so my controller won't let me use a mic. I have tried to use several different mics and none of them have worked. The reason I know it's my controller is because it makes the noise when you plug it in but it still wont work. I don't really want to buy a new controller because then it's an even bigger deal when that controller doesn't work. Has someone been in the same situation and been able to fix it. Thanks&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Hello I&nbsp;am sorry your controller is not working, does your controller have a built in audio jack or an adapter? If it is the internal audio jack you can contact xbox support here&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-broken-wont-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-broken-wont-work</a> to see if you can repair or replace your controller. Sometimes its just as expensive as buying a new one though so you'll just have to find out how much it is. If its an adapter you can simply buy a new one and see if that works better, most stores have adapters for sale and they are fairly cheap.</p>
