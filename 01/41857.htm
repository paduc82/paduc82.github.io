<h2>            System Restore error 0x80042329. Help.</h2>
                    <p>HI i have a bit of a problem that i think has to do with a update a few days ago.</p>
<p>When I restarted my computer after the update it took like a hour to boot up then another half hour to login. at first the screen was black with the mouse courser. Then slowly the icons and all that stuff started to appear. One problem though, when I tried
 to click on stuff the screen would freeze up for a min or two then take 15 min to start what ever i wanted to start up. When I tried going into my control panel it took about 15-20 min to load whatever I typed. So I decided to restore my computer to a week
 before this problem. when the restore started it took about 2 hours then a message showed up saying this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings were not changed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Too much time elapsed between freezing a transaction manager and thawing the</strong></p>
<p><strong>transaction manager. (0x80042329)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could help me fix this so i can restore my computer to where it was that would be great!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience and I will be happy to answer your query. There could be several reasons for this cause including any third party software conflict, system files missing/corruption etc. I appreciate the effort made towards the fixes. Let's
 try a few more and check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3: </strong>Run System File Checker tool</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, type <span>Command Prompt</span> or <span>
cmd</span> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><div><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Most of the older version games don't support windows 7. </p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Download the Windows Virtual PC software and the windows XP mode from the official microsoft download center. Then install the Windows Virtual PC software and open the windows XP virtual machine and install the game through that.
</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>practical one :-)</p>
<p>search the installation CD for a crack file and then copy and paste it to the game's system folder.</p>

<h2>            Security update failed, wireless printer install failed.</h2>
                    Having a couple of problems.&nbsp; Don't know if they might be related.&nbsp; Made the choice of topic difficult.
<br />
<br />
Security Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB2847559) failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Code: 0x663
<br />
This update failed on several attempts.&nbsp; Tried the advice given with windows update.&nbsp; Windows repaired something, that is how the other failures were corrected.&nbsp; This last two times were manual updates.<br />
<br />
eMachines W3506 running Windows XP home SP3<br />
Automatic updates set to notify only.<br />
<br />
Second problem.&nbsp; Failed printer install.&nbsp; Attempting to install HP Photosmart 7520 All In One wireless printer on this computer.<br />
The printer works on the network, it works with other computers on the network, and the eprint function works.&nbsp; It is recognized by the install process, but then fails to install because it is not connected.&nbsp; I can access it through through a web browser using
 the IP address.<br />
I have tried all advice I have found on the internet regarding this issue with HP printers, but most of it does not apply because it works, except for this computer.&nbsp; The other computers are Windows 7.<br />
<br />
eMachines W3506 running Windows XP home SP3<br />
Netgear WNR1000 wireless router.&nbsp; Lan between computer and router.&nbsp; Wifi between router and printer.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            Usually, its best to install HP wireless printer by running the install program on the CD enclosed with the printer.<br />
<br />
If that's not available:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Download the driver from HP, extract it, and make a note of the folder where the installation files are located.<br />
</li><li>Log on as a user with "computer administrator" privileges</li><li>Go to Printers and Faxes and start the Add Printer Wizard</li><li>Click Next to get past the Intro screen, then select the radio button for "Local printer attached to this computer."&nbsp; UNcheck the box to "Automatically detect my Plug and Play printer." Click Next.</li><li>Select the radio button to "Create a new port."&nbsp; From the dropdown list, select "HP Standard TCP/IP Port" (if available) or "Standard TCP/IP Port." Click Next<br />
</li><li>Read the Intro page of the Add Standard TCP/IP Printer Port Wizard and click Next</li><li>Enter the IP of the printer in the "Printer name or IP Address" box.&nbsp; You can leave the "Port name" box blank; it will be filled in automatically.&nbsp; Click Next</li><li>Read the confirmation page and click Next</li><li>You'll be returned to the Add Printer wizard where you select the Manufacturer and Model.&nbsp; You can scroll through, but I doubt you'll find an entry for the Photosmart 7520, so click "Have disk" and point the installer to the folder where you extracted the
 driver installation files, select the *.inf file and follow the rest of the on-screen instruction to complete the installation.<br />

            Using an administrator account I first attempted to install using the HP install CD.&nbsp; It installs, what kind of connection, search for printer on network, choose printer found, install continues, "Unsuccessful network installation"&nbsp; "The printer was unable
 to be installed over the network"<br />
<br />
Check network connections, router settings including router reboot (Netgear router) and printer settings, and update printer firmware.&nbsp; Self test ok.&nbsp; Test page from printer ok.&nbsp; ePrint settings ok and tested.&nbsp; Router accepts printer settings and assigns valid
 IP.&nbsp; Printer working good across network, except for this one computer.&nbsp; I can use the IP address to access the printer console, check settings, check ink levels, etc.&nbsp; But the computer and set up cannot communicate.<br />
<br />
Windows update to find and install all updates.&nbsp; <br />
Downloaded full install HP suite from HP.&nbsp; Installed.&nbsp; Again with failed install.&nbsp;
<br />
Download and attempt to install basic drivers for printer direct from HP.&nbsp; Still failed.<br />
Full virus scan, Malwarebytes full scan including rootkits scan, and SuperAntiSpyware full scan.<br />
Attempt printer install again.&nbsp; Failed again.<br />
Backup and clean registry using CCleaner.<br />
Attempt install again.&nbsp; Failed again.<br />
Remove suite and all traces of HP related programs using REVO uninstaller.&nbsp; 700+ orphaned files and unused registry entries cleaned up afterward.&nbsp; Back up and clean registry again.<br />
Attempt to install full HP suite from scratch again.&nbsp; Still fail. <br />
Remove and attempt to install basic drivers again.&nbsp; Fail.<br />
Manually add printer using TCP/IP and IP address.&nbsp; I now have basic functionality. for documents anyway.<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is be able to install this printer and use its full functionality.&nbsp; I have installed many HP printers over the years for myself and others.&nbsp; Even the occasional stubborn install.&nbsp; I have never had a problem like this where a fully functioning
 network printer has issues with, and refuses to install on one particular machine.<br />

everything seems normal.<br />
<br />
Can you perform other network operations from the problem computer?&nbsp; For example, can you access files on another of your network computers from the problem computer? Can you access files located on the problem computer from one of the other computers?&nbsp; A misconfigured
 -- or unknown -- firewall could be causing your problems.&nbsp; Going back to your original post ... what advice did you follow after the problem with Windows Update?&nbsp; What (as exactly as you can recall) did you do to get things working again?<br />
<br />
What happened after you followed the directions I provided?&nbsp; If the procedure failed, where did it fail and with what error message (complete text, without paraphrasing, please)?<br />
<br />
What does<br />
<blockquote>Manually add printer using TCP/IP and IP address.&nbsp; I now have basic functionality. for documents anyway.
</blockquote>
mean?&nbsp; If you have "basic functionality," what don't you have?&nbsp; Do you mean that the printer is installed but the HP software package isn't installed?<br />
<br />
Do all the failed installs fail with the identical message, i.e., "Unsuccessful network installation.&nbsp; The printer was unable to be installed over the network"?<br />
<br />
One thing to be aware of ... merely uninstalling a printer and then reinstalling often does NOT result in the installation of a new driver.&nbsp; If there was a problem with the previous installation, it often is propagated into subsequent attempts to install.&nbsp;
 The way to get around this is described in <a href="http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Article One </a>... particularly Step 4.&nbsp; If you suspect driver corruption, you need to remove the old drivers using the File &gt; Server Properties before installing a new driver.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<span>Windows installs hardware devices using INF files.&nbsp; These are located in %windir%\inf.&nbsp; In reality, the previous statement is incomplete.&nbsp; The first time a device is installed, Windows uses the INF file to create a corresponding PNF file located in the
 same directory.&nbsp; The PNF file is a "precompiled" version of the INF file and Windows setup actually uses the PNF file because it is "more efficient" to do so.<br />
<br />
If you download a new driver and only replace the INF file and do not delete the old driver files, when you "update" the driver, Windows setup looks at the old PNF file which points to the old files and uses them.<br />
<br />
Your use of a registry cleaner may or may not have </span>had a similar effect -- and may or may not have damaged your Windows installation to the point where the only solution is a clean reinstall of Windows.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm out of ideas.<br />

            Thanks for the responses LemP.<br />
The printer was set up on two windows 7 laptops and worked fine, although eprint was never properly set up.&nbsp; One of the laptops is temporarily not available.&nbsp; The other developed a broken power jack and dead battery.&nbsp; That is the reason this eMachines computer
 was brought back into service, to do some printing.&nbsp; Pictures and documents.&nbsp; It was taken out of service simply because the laptops were more convenient and faster.<br />
<br />
So, without the other computers available I cannot tell if I can access their files or not.&nbsp; I can tell you I have Teamviewer installed and can access the computer remotely, giving full access to all files, hardware and settings.<br />
<br />
The only firewall is Windows firewall.&nbsp; It has exceptions for the HP printer software.&nbsp; I turned it off during some of the testing just in case it might be the problem.<br />
<br />
The problem with Windows update.&nbsp; I made several attempts at downloading and installing.&nbsp; I allowed it to automatically install.&nbsp; I tried custom install.&nbsp; I tried windows help, and I allowed windows to repair it, as windows help recommended.&nbsp; It said something
 was broken and when it was finished it said it was fixed.&nbsp; I tried again with no luck.&nbsp; I can't help wonder if the security update failure is not a microsoft problem.&nbsp; One of the times I tried to install I noticed the file size, on the windows update screen,
 was 0kb.<br />
<br />
"&nbsp; What (as exactly as you can recall) did you do to get things working again?"<br />
The computer worked, and still does work just fine.&nbsp; The security update was never able to be installed.&nbsp; The printer function is only minimal as I can not use the HP software to operate it.<br />
Before coming here I gave up on the HP software and went through the control panel, printers and faxes, add a printer.......Originally I tried to add a network printer and following the instructions it failed.&nbsp; I then tried add a printer as a local printer
 and pulling the host ID and IP address from the control panel through the browser I was able to get Windows to find the printer.&nbsp; After waiting a while for it to try to find the right drivers, and the right printer, I was eventually asked for a install cd
 for the .inf files.&nbsp; I successfully printed a test page, from the computer before finishing the install.&nbsp; My attempt at printing a picture failed when it printed on plain paper instead of picture paper.&nbsp; Now that a connection was made to print I tried to use
 the HP software, but still failed to find the printer and install as before.<br />
<br />
Yes all the install attempts failed the same way.&nbsp; Early on as I watched the installs it would ask what kind of connection, I checked wireless network, it would search the network for printers and list the one I am trying to instal.&nbsp; I click on it and then
 it would tell it could not find the printer, then fail with message above.&nbsp; I attempted to retry, to get help with the printer, and using the built in diagnostics tools.&nbsp; Using HP printer and network diagnostic tools from the computer as well.&nbsp; No luck yet.<br />
lNo I have not been able to follow your instructions, bt they seem quite a bit like what i did last night to get the functionality I did.&nbsp; It is too late to to have the printer making racket right now, so I will check it tomorrow. and reply with step by step
 as you requested.<br />
<br />
I am aware that uninstalling does not always remove old drivers, and .inf files.&nbsp; That is why I after backing up I remove programs with REVO uninstaller.&nbsp; To get all that left over stuff.&nbsp; I did take a look in the
<span>%windir%\inf folder and all the files are only duplicates, .inf and .pnf.&nbsp; An interesting observation is</span> that most writing was blue, while a few files were black.<br />
<br />
The registry cleaning did not harm the computer.&nbsp; The problem existed before using the cleaner, and no additional problems have developed after its use.&nbsp; I always back up the registry before doing a cleaning and mostly clean orphaned and broken entries.&nbsp; I'm
 pretty careful about how I use those.<br />
<br />
Anyway, tomorrow I will work on it some more.&nbsp; I will follow your step by step and give you the detailed answers you asked for.&nbsp; Sorry I could not give better descriptions earlier, but after so many hours of trying and failing it just all blurred together.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Here's my take, for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
It seems that you're able to print OK using native Windows programs.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you mean by your "attempt at printing a picture failed when it printed on plain paper instead of picture paper," unless your printer has the capability to select from different
 paper trays (which I didn't think it did).&nbsp; If you want it to print on photo paper, don't you have to manually load the photo paper instead of the plain paper?<br />
<br />
From what you describe, I think you've already done what I suggested.&nbsp; All my procedure does is get the printer connected to the computer.&nbsp; It doesn't install any of the HP software.<br />
<br />
I have no clue why the HP software won't install.&nbsp; That seems to be a separate issue from installing the printer.&nbsp; In any case, it's usually not necessary to use HP's software (which is why
<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=5286642&amp;prodTypeId=0&amp;prodSeriesId=5199461&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=1093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP offers</a> a "Basic Driver" download as an alternative to the "Full Feature Software and Drivers" (31 MB instead of 78).&nbsp; If you really need the HP software, I suggest getting in touch with HP support.<br />
<br />
As far as the Windows Update issue is concerned, my suggestion is to uninstall Silverlight completely (from Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs).&nbsp; Silverlight is Microsoft's attempt to compete with Adobe Flash, and as far as I know, the only web sites were
 you'll find videos that require Silverlight are Microsoft web sites.<br />

<h2>            50,000 Reward points for One X Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>hello, i am asking&nbsp;about the 50,000 rewards points for upgrading to the one x.&nbsp; first i just want to say i have been a long time xbox gamer, for about 9 years. i owned and played a 360 and a xbox one for many years and recently upgraded to the one x when pre orders were available, getting myself a one x scorpio edition. In&nbsp;the new microsoft rewards app, i noticed a reward of 50,000 points for upgrading to a one x, i have previously upgraded from a One to a One X, forking over almost 700$&nbsp;for the new system and never got 1 single decent bonus. people all over the country and the USA got codes for gears of war ultimate edition, among other codes for free games and all i got was a free trial for 1 month of game pass that i couldnt even use, for paying alot of money and getting there early for the scoprio edition. just wondering why this is? and if i am eligible for the 50,000 rewards points as i think i should be.</p>

<h2>            Two Consoles Same Network, both have open NAT&#63;&#63; Am I missing something&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Recently bought a second Xbox One both connected to the same network and both show open NAT and pass the multiplayer diagnostic test just fine. The problem is streaming and playing games online. When streaming, videos freeze about
 every 5-10 minutes. Online play, a match of Halo 5 Warzone will disconnect at 00:22 every time. Even if I unplug one console the problem persist, note this never happened before. If both consoles are connected trying to play a halo match I get the "Can't connect
 to data center" error. Im thinking of just buying a new router?</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in?&nbsp;<strong>United States/Texas</strong></p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number:&nbsp;<strong>Motorolla SB6121</strong></p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number:&nbsp;<strong>Asus RT-N56U</strong></p>
<p>Things you have tried: Re-set router as new. Power cycle( shutting down modem and router.</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown:&nbsp;<strong>YES</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT? <strong>
OPEN</strong></p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: None?</p>
<p>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)?<strong>&nbsp;Xfinity/Comcast 56mbps</strong></p>

<p>Are both wireless or wired ? or one of each ?....seams like one should be strict or moderate (maybe one really is )....does each one have its own ip assigned ? &nbsp; If you go the new router path I think Netgear has the most 2 Xboxes friendliness deal as their
 UPNP seams to work really well ....if you can get one from a store and try make sure you can return it if it dosent help you...</p>

<p>yes , did you manually give each xbox one a static ip , &nbsp;they may be fighting over ports &nbsp;....are things close enough to hardwire them or at least could they be for test purposes ?...im not even sure you need a static ip anyway as that is mostly for port
 forwarding , which will be no help using two Xboxes...I think a good gaming router that supports multiple consoles is gona be a must here... sometimes a wired connection has a lot less issues than a wireless one ...

<p>No I did not manually give them a static IP,</p>
<p>The rooms they are located are far from the router, but i have tested them individually by connecting directly to the modem and no problems, so yes i could hardwire for test purposes. But the new router seems like my best bet i guess.

            Hello Ceraxtmeke,<br />
<br />
If you've configured and set up the password and fingerprint scan through HP ProtectTools Administrative Console then its possible that this is the reason why you're getting the pop-up.
<br />
<br />
You would need to disable Smart Card Plug and Play in local Group Policy. To do this, follow the steps I've listed below:<br />
<br />
1. Click <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>gpedit.msc </strong>in the <strong>
Search programs and files</strong> box, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
2. In the console tree under <strong><em>Computer Configuration</em></strong>, click
<strong>Administrative Templates</strong>.<br />
3. In the details pane, double-click <strong>Windows Components</strong>, and then double-click
<strong>Smart Card</strong>.<br />
4. Right-click <strong>Turn on Smart Card Plug and Play service</strong>, and then click
<strong>Edit</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Disabled</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />

<div>Hi <strong>HelenK</strong>,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />
You can try running a program from Microsoft website that automatically diagnoses and repairs problems with printing, installing a printer, connecting to a network printer, and other related errors. To do so, click this link and follow the instructions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Open the Printer troubleshooter</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
We will try to uninstall the drivers for the printer from the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Refer:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Find and install printer drivers<br />

<div>&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Here you may visit this below link and download the complete version of the drivers for the device.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div>
<div><a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=501045&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=501044&amp;taskId=135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=501045&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=501044&amp;taskId=135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
After downloading the driver you may install it and check if the issue gets fixed as the Windows 7 software for the Model is available and can download the same.</div>

    <title>Canceling a restart during an update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azheng1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canceling a restart during an update</h2>
                    <p>So I was installing some Windows updates, and restarted the computer to finish them. However, when I did that, it told me that there was an application called "Program Manager" still open that was preventing the restart. I waited a bit, but this application
 would not close, so to be safe, I hit cancel (I didn't want to potentially mess up the updates by forcing it to restart). However, after cancelling (which I assume is supposed to stop the restart and bring you back to the desktop), the restart/update process
 kept going. The updates installed just fine as far as I can tell, but now I'm curious about a couple things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Can a restart during an update be stopped, or is it designed to go through with the restart no matter what?</p>
<p>2) What would have happened if I had clicked "Restart Anyway" instead of "Cancel"?</p>
<p>3) If the restart happens no matter what, what's the point of informing me about open applications and letting me click on things?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Whenever you're installing a Windows Update, it will require you to restart the computer to ensure that updates will take effect. Since the Windows Update were already downloaded, the update will automatically installed the next time you restart the computer.
 Feel free to post back if you have further questions.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello! See if you can boot into the Advanced Startup mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC isn’t loading Windows 10 and you don’t have the operating system installation files, you can use the following trick.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer and follow the POST, when Windows should begin loading, press the power button to shutdown your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat the previous step twice, and in the third restart the operating system should enter into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), where a number of diagnostics will be performed to try fix any booting issues, but you will also get an option
 to access the Windows Startup Settings</p>

            <p>Hi, Rajeev.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you have used the Mangal to type text in Hindi, Marathi or some other language that is written using Devanagari writing. If so, your issue is similar to the one described in this thread — except that case involved Tamil:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/installing-tamil-fonts-in-windows-10/ac5b087a-1b5d-463c-b3dd-1474a8c29ac5"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Installing Tamil fonts in Windows 10</span></a></p>
<p>The Mangal font is in an optional font feature, "Devanagari Supplemental Fonts", that can be installed manually or that is automatically installed if you add a language such as Hindi or Marathi into your language settings.</p>
<p>See the information I provided in the Tamil discussion at the link above; you should be able to adapt it to your case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps. Let me know if you need additional help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Carte de calibrage Kinect</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>J'ai contacter une de vos collaboratrice du chat en direct qui m'a dis de voir avec vous mon problème.</p>
<p>J'ai un capteur Kinect depuis sa sortie, seulement à l'achat il n'y avait pas de carte de calibrage dans la boite. Jusqu'à maintenant ca n'était pas un problème car je vivais chez mes parents et j'avais l'espace de jeu largement suffisant.</p>
<p>Seulement maintenant, j'ai ma maison et je n'ai pas l'espace suffisant et je dois calibrer mon capteur Kinect, qui me reclame la carte de calibrage que je n'ai pas.</p>
<p>Serait-il possible qu'on m'en fasse parvenir une que je puisse calibrer ma console.</p>
<p>Merci à vous</p>

<p>PS: je ne peux pas emprunter la carte à quelqu'un car je n'ai personne dans mes contact qui possède également un capteur Kinect</p>

<h2>            Changed Mail adress</h2>
                    When i started my xbox and it tried to log in automaticly like allways, the contact information for my account had been changed. So now it is an email account that i have no idea what it is. So i guess my account have been hacked. Now i cant change it

<h2>            Xbox S 4gb to 250gb</h2>
                    
<p>Hellow, heres the deal.</p>
<p>I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Xbox S </span>with the 4gb hdd which filled up fast.</p>
<p>but mainly with dlc such as halo reach defient and heroic map pack (4gb gets you nowhere), borderlands save files and a few other games where the content is saved directly to the hdd not the profile</p>
<p>recently purchased a 250gb hdd, for 90 $ or w/e.</p>
<p>heres my question, is there a possibly way to transfer the content off the 4gb to the 250gb so that i can have both my borderlands saves,&nbsp; so i can install dlc from GOTY edition, and also have my halo maps and dlc from reach also on there too?</p>

 can't dispatch any tabs period. It also fails to power down. I haven't downloaded anything and dell checkup is fine with no bugs either. If the powershell programs are of importance I'm going to have to find an answer.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Windows PowerShell is a command line interface and might not be the reason for the issues you are encountering.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the same issue is not encountered in safe mode with networking follow the steps to configure your computer to clean boot state and check which
 of the third party application is causing this. To configure your computer to clean boot follow the link given below.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Saldo da conta simplesmente sumiu</h2>
                    
<p>Boa tarde.</p>
<p>Bom pessoal, eu possuia $81.00 dolares na minha conta US.</p>
<p>Hoje pela manhã entrei nela, e reparei que simplesmente todo o saldo não estava la, marcando 0,00. Entrei pelo site do xbox para consultar por lá, e também aparecia 0,00. Fui até o histórico de compras para ver se talvez alguma outra pessoa tivesse gastado,
 mas não foi o caso.</p>
<p>Eu queria a ajuda de vocês pra saber qual uma possivel explicação para que meu saldo simplesmente sumisse..&nbsp;</p>
<p>O unico meio que vou recorrer por enquanto será ligar ao suporte pra ver o que irão falar..</p>

<p>mancada minha mesmo.. lembram daquela promoção do ano passado da gamestop, que ela dava $5 a cada facebook que você logava e resgatava o código? pois então.. como se tratava de códigos promocionais eles tem um tempo de validade, onde expira em 1 ano.. e
 o meu no caso expirou dia 11.07.2015.</p>
<p>O suporte da ms mandou eu entrar em contato com o suporte da gamestop pra ver se eles poderiam fazer algo em relação a isso, mas acho dificil..</p>
<p>não estou p<span>µto porque foi algo "de graça",</span>&nbsp;mas mesmo assim era dinheiro kkk'</p>

    <title>Two Identical backups - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardp001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Identical backups</h2>
                    <p>I made a system image backup and then turned on File History which began backing up my data files.&nbsp; So I now have two identical backups of my date files, one in the system image backup and the other in file history backup, is that correct?&nbsp; If so what genius
 created this space wasting backup system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I erase the file history backup directory and fool the file history system into thinking it has already backedup up the files that were in the erased backup directory so it only backs up files that were created after my initial backup?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>These two backups are not in the least identical.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Backup</strong>. This backup file contains a complete image of your system drive. You can use it to restore Windows in case your hard disk fails. You create a new image maybe once a year.</li><li><strong>File History</strong>. This backup contains your personal data files. You can use it to restore any of your files in case you lose or damage them. This backup is updated continuously.</li></ul>
<p>It seems that the genius who designed this system did have his thinking cap where it belongs, on his head. You could, of course, argue that the image backup should not contain user data. Indeed, but this shakes the whole foundation of storing user data on
 the system partition. I keep it elsewhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your tolerant and helpful response.&nbsp; Alright, I'm a doofuss, but not because I equated the data backups included in my system image backup with the data documents backed up in the File History, but for not creating a different hard drive partition
 for my data, separate from system and program files.&nbsp; If I had done this, the image backup for the system files would not have included my data files which are now included on the same drive partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone can help me correct this situation:&nbsp; I think I may be stuck with what I have.&nbsp; I do not want to reinstall all my programs in rectifying&nbsp; my situation because I don't have all the original program disks or install downloads, but I am afraid
 that is what I would have to do.&nbsp; I think that if I want to re-partition my hard drive so that I have a separate partition for my data files I will have to reformat the disk to start over.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; Okay, if I re-partition the drive I have to leave
 enough room on the system partition to restore the entire system backup I have made which will include all my data.&nbsp; Even if I move this data to the new data partition I have created I will still have this wasted space in my system partition left over from
 the data files.&nbsp; I will however have created more space on my backup drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could erase all the data on my current drive and just leave the system and program files and then create a new system image.&nbsp; Then my new system partition could be much smaller to receive the newer system image backup.&nbsp; I could restore the data files from
 my file history to a new data partition.&nbsp; Whew! that's a lot of work, and more importantly time.&nbsp; It took over 12 hours to create the system image I have now--about 550 GB.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabytes is cheap, time is not.&nbsp; I guess I will just buy a new hard drive for my data and leave a bunch of space on my existing drive after I transfer my data files from it.</p>

<p><em>I don't have all the original program disks or install downloads</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This is risky. Robust data processing requires all installation media, keys and purchasing details to be kept in a safe place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I think that if I want to re-partition my hard drive so that I have a separate partition for my data files I will have to reformat the disk to start over.&nbsp; Is that correct?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; No. Free tools such as Aomei let you repartition your disk non-destructively.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If I re-partition the drive I have to leave enough room on the system partition to restore the entire system backup I have made which will include all my data.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Correct, until you create a new and tighter image.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>It took over 12 hours to create the system image I have now--about 550 GB.&nbsp;</em><br />
-&gt; My system drive images are usually around 30 GBytes and take 30 minutes to create, using Acronis True Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Gigabytes is cheap, time is not.&nbsp; I guess I will just buy a new hard drive for my data and leave a bunch of space on my existing drive after I transfer my data files from it.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; In your case this is probably the most effective solution.</p>

            The trouble shooter did not provide any help - however, after a second reboot the mail suddenly worked again. No idea if it is related, but at least I can access it now

    <title>Cannot capture from Canon Optura 50 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> texas.kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot capture from Canon Optura 50</h2>
                    I'm trying to set up video and audio capture from a Canon Optura 50 on a new Acer Aspire AX3400-U2012 running Windows 7 64-bit. (This computer does not come with FireWire ports by default, so I added a PCIe FireWire card specifically for this purpose.)
 I plug in the camcorder and it *does* show up in the Devices &amp; Printers listing, but none of the video editing programs I've tried (Windows Live Movie Maker, Nero Vision 10, Ulead Visual Studio 11) recognizes the camcorder as a capture source. Windows 7 is
 fully patched and both the FireWire card and the camcorder installed without any manual driver installation, so I'm at a loss to explain what's going on. Please help!

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp;texas.kelly,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Are you trying to use the camera in Windows 7 for the first time or was it working fine before?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to download the software for DV messenger and run it in Windows XP compatibility mode and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the following Windows article:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since there seems to be no Windows 7 drivers available, I would recommend you to check with the manufacturer of the camera regarding
 this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

    <title>MM 2.6 only video no audio after save movie file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manofthehoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            MM 2.6 only video no audio after save movie file</h2>
                    I'm using my dad's travel computer, and I'm having problems finishing making a video for a school project. I'm running Movie Maker 2.6 on a Toshiba NB305. The video files are .avi and the music files .wma. I've finished putting together this 8 minute video,
 and while I was making it I had no problems seeing the video and hearing the audio as I put it together besides the expected lag from the fact that this computer is pretty crappy.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem happens when I save the movie file. I've tried three times now, and each time it saves a movie file, it takes a long time, but in the end the file has no video. The audio plays fine, the file is 8 minutes long, but there is just a black screen
 where my audio should be.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is for a school project that's due in 9 hours, so I really need help ASAP. I can't use any newer version of Movie Maker because this computer is so prehistoric. Thank you!!</div>
                </div>

==========================================<br />
Are you running Win 7 or Vista?<br />
<br />
Try converting the AVI to the WMV format before importing<br />
into&nbsp;Movie Maker.and you should have a better result:<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...some <br />
free...some retail.<br />
<br />
The following freeware converter is just an example:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest download)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup296.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screens)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag &gt;FFSetup296.exe&lt; out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
If you still have problems...try going to...Tools / Options / <br />
Compatibility tab and uncheck all the filters / OK.
