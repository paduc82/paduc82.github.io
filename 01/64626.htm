<p>Hello xolomn,</p>
<p>The file <strong>QtGui4.dll</strong> is a legitimate component of Adobe Photoshop Elements. Do you have Adobe Photoshop installed on your computer?<br />
Do a search for the QtGui4.dll and then check the path of the file. It may be malware if not in the correct path for Adobe.<br />
Download Microsoft Security Essentials and scan for malware from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Or use any other virus scanner to check and verify your computer is not<br />
infected.</p>
<p>You have installed several games that if downloaded may contain a virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business always automatically opening up a window</h2>
                    <p>I have just downloaded a series of applications with a college student account and skype for business was an app that I could not opt out of downloading. After downloading this series of apps everything seamed fine but now, I have discovered that every time
 I power up or restart the computer, Skype for Business opens a window that I have to exit out of every time. also, every time that I exit out of the application, an error pops up to tell me that the computer was in able to fully exit out of the app and that
 I have no choice but to allow it to stay operating in the background. When I try to uninstall just skype for business, I can't, if I want to uninstall it I need to in install the other apps too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I keep it from showing the window on start up?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First off, sorry for sounding confrontational, just a bit annoyed with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue affects my Surface RT, as well as the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>No updates, refreshes, registry tweaks, toggles, or anything has fixed the issue thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the original SP3 via the Microsoft Store because of other Wifi/BT issues, this unit is brand new from a retail box, opened: tried to connect without any updates applied, and experienced the same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then applied all windows updates and firmware updates, and experienced the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried connecting through both the Modern or Win32 control panels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to connect other devices to the SP3, such as mice, keyboards, the phones, other computers, etc. Despite some intermittent connection issues with the mouse, everything is able to connect fine. I am also able to establish connections with the SP3
 in reverse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the previous poster eluded to, I see the device, and the computer connects to the device, but it appears as a headset and not a speaker. Once connected, (with Windows 8.1 Update 1 installed) it used to just say it was connected then disconnected, and
 constantly toggle that status (also the light on the souondbar kept flashing, indicating that the soundbar itself did not recognize it as connected despite windows saying it was connected). As of Windows 8.1 "Update 2" it stays connected, but still appears
 as a headset, with no audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting through Win32 Control Panel and looking at the devices, I can see the headset. When I look at the properties I see the services it provides as "Audio Sink" and "Remote Control". When I try clicking on Audio Sink, I receive an error saying
 the parameter is incorrect (which I would imagine is due to it being detected as a a headset versus a speaker).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a comment:</p>
<p>No, the device does not appear in the compatibility center, but I also take issue with that. This is a basic soundbar, with no special features, very basic functionality from a well known brand (Klipsch/Energy). I actually find it somewhat interesting that
 it is not listed, but I also don't see any reason why it /shouldn't/ work, especially considering this is
</p>
<p>a) full Windows, with an incredibly new BT module/stack and</p>
<p>b) literally every other device I own, as well as anyone elses' devices which have tried to are able to connect.</p>
<p>

            I see they split your comment into a new thread. It also worth pointing out that Windows 7 PCs have no trouble connecting to these devices. Maybe this weekend, I'll go to the MSFT store and have them bring a pile of tablets to the Best Buy or Bose store
 so they can appreciate the issue.

            I want to be more upset with Energy since they must be using some stupid bluetooth profile, but I'm also annoyed that, seriously, literally, EVERYTHING else can pair to it just fine, except any surface tablet. Even my WP8 phones don't have issue....<br />

            I hear you. I have corresponded by e-mail and phone directly with the Klipsch support engineers. They said this back in May:
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>"We have still be trying to work this out with Microsoft. The SB-120 works with all windows 8 phones we have tested with."</span></span></p>
<p>They mentioned a possible issue with the aptX implementation, but that was just added with WP8.1 and it worked fine before then. I've tried my Surface 2, a W8.1 laptop, and a W8.1 desktop using a third party aptX enabled USB BT
 adapter. No luck. With any luck, another forum moderator&nbsp;or MVP will give us another troubleshooter to run...</p>

            Yeah, and I was under the impression that the com stacks between WP and Windows 8 were one of the more shared aspects between the OS's, that's what makes the fact that the phone connects without issue, but windows 8 tablets will not so strange. The issue
 must be on the Windows 8 side of things, wouldn't you say?<br />

            It absolutely is an issue with Windows 8. There are dozens of posts in this forum from people who had no issues with Windows 7 PCs, then upgraded those machines to 8 and could no longer connect.

            I&nbsp;took my Surface 2 to Target and tried connecting with the various Bluetooth speakers on display. I had no issues with Bose or Sony. Jambox and JBL were not set up for customer pairing. The issue is definitely specific to Windows 8 and definitely specific
 to Klipsch products.

            <p>When playing audio through the devices speakers or through hardwired headphones, there are no audio issues. However when i connect the device via Bluetooth to say my Onkyo receiver, or to another stereo device such as a car stereo system, or bluetooth headphones,
 the audio is sped up to a ridiculous rate. Its probably several times faster than what the chipmunks sound like.</p>

                    <p>I have repeatedly tried to install this update, either via the update download website, or from the media tool and each time it fails with varying error codes, or just with "something went wrong" which is even more infuriating than the error codes which
 are not particularly helpful.</p>
<p>After around a dozen attempts to get this thing installed I'm at the point of giving up.</p>
<p>I have tried ALL the recommended "solutions", although I cannot rename catroot2 as I just get access denied, when the media tool is used to update this computer it fails with error 0x80070057 - 0x2000A, "The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with
 an error during PREPARE_FIRST_BOOT operation and if I use the download from the web site I repeatedly get 0x80004005 error, have had a couple of others, but end result is that the update appears to be unusable and the error messages useless.</p>
<p>As I said I have tried ALL the suggested "fixes" to no avail.</p>

<h2>            downgrade to windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have bought a new laptop, which came with Windows 8 installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having tried out the new&nbsp;operating system I find it&nbsp;is slow, and the user interface is horribly ugly and cumbersome to use on a non-touch device.&nbsp; How can I "downgrade" to Windows 7?&nbsp; Do I have to buy a Windows 7 CD?</p>

<p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>
<b>
<p>Additional information:</p>
</b></span><font><span>
<p>Since you want to downgrade to Windows 7 to meet the business requirement, you may refer this article and check if it helps.</p>

 downgrade rights</span></font></font></u></b></a></p>
<font><span>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).</p>
<p>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</p>
<p>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</p>
<p>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</p>
<p>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</p>
<p>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade
 rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</p>
<p>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</p>

<h2>            What is going on in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have found something interesting...I just got a "security" update (quotes because of what happened) from microsoft. I restarted the computer and I lost the notification icon and the start button. I then decided to install the video drivers that have caused
 this in the past. Installing the video drivers, I double clicked on the downloaded file for the most recent video drivers...It extracted all the files...It checked for compatibility....I then did a custom install to do a clean (remove previous versions) install...It
 didn't restart like it used to...Then I ran around windows 10 and the start button and notification icon were working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened? Will this happen again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't see a place for windows updates or the like so I put it into the hardware and drivers area.</p>

<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner<br />
and their supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation <br />
and&nbsp; drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows (10, 8/8.1, 7, Vista, and XP)<br />

Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<p>have tried all the rest of the advice on the community site and none of it works,</p>
<p>the only difference i can see is that in the Print Spooler properties</p>

            <p>Hi after going through&nbsp;your suggestions none of which worked, I decided to revert back to win7,</p>
<p>However a few days later I received notification from Microsoft that certain troublesome areas had been looked at and there were now new updates, after installing these I have now reinstalled win10, which has also been upgraded,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and&nbsp;guess what&nbsp;the spooler is now working ok.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi, Janices,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a question for Google or Ebay </p>
<p>Picasa Help </p>
<p>Upload picture to ebay store</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/PicasaGuide/browse_thread/thread/07dad3dc0d99a2c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/PicasaGuide/browse_thread/thread/07dad3dc0d99a2c5</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't upload ....</p>
<p>When you're at eBay (or any site, really), in your web browser, if you do a right -&gt; "Save" on a photo, you're saving the photo to SOME folder on your hard disk.<br />
<br />
You need to be sure that Picasa is configured to be looking at that folder. <br />
In general, if you save the photos in your My Pictures (or "Pictures") area, Picasa will see them. And if you save them in a new folder that is nested in your My Pictures or Pictures area, Picasa will see them.
<br />
<br />
First, make sure Picasa is set to "Scan Always" on the folders where your photos are saved.
<br />
In Picasa, do a Tools -&gt; "Folder Manager..." menu choice. <br />
Make sure the right folders (especially the folder(s) where you're saving photos in your web browser) are set to "Scan Always".
<br />
<br />
Second, if the photos are smallish, Picasa may ignore them. <br />
You can tell it to not do that by doing a View -&gt; "Small Pictures" menu choice (put the check mark by "Small Pictures" in that menu choice.
<br />
<br />
One of those will probably get you going. <br />
Otherwise, read through this: <br />

<h2>            Automatic Repair won&#39;t let me log in</h2>
                    <p>Im having an issue with Windows 10 in which whenever I boot up my computer, Windows goes into the automatic startup repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that whenever I try to enter my password to get past the startup repair screen it keeps saying that my password is incorrect. I have changed my password about 5 times to combat this, but everytime i change it it keeps saying it is incorrect.</p>

            HiJamesStewart98 ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you using Windows 8/Windows 8.1 DVD?</span></li><li><span>How did you install Windows 8.1? Is it through upgrade or clean install?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can occur if Windows Boot files are corrupted. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Normally, if you are unable to boot the Windows 8.1 to its Start Screen, the Automatic Repair will check for the errors which is preventing Windows from booting up and
 will fix it. If this does not happen, then when you may need to run the Automatic Repair by booting the computer to Windows 8.1 installation/recovery disc and then it will fix the issue if the issue with any startup files required for Windows 8.1 to boot up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Boot the computer from the disc and then try the following method to perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8.1 installation disk.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the “<strong><em>Windows Setup</em></strong>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on “<strong><em>Repair your computer</em></strong>” from the lower left corner.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the “<strong><em>Choose an option screen</em></strong>”, click on “<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click “<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>” screen.</span></li><li><span styl

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

            <p>Thanks, I didn't wanted to refresh my pc, but did it anyway (it took 6 hours).
</p>
<p>I'm really baffeled by integrity problems of windows shell (explorer). It heavily relies on windows registry, and it can misbehave even with just single change, I know that's how it's meant to be, but it should be at least a bit fail safe, since registry
 can be changed at any time, by anything, and that can screw up your day (or weak if you have older pc).&nbsp;

            <p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for future reference, if a change is recent, you can do a system restore.</p>
<p>But you can't do a selective restore to a particular date as you say that you deleted a lot of files at the same time.</p>
<p>And that was why I suggested the SFC to fix System files as that is where the problem was..</p>

            Hey Jude.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Cortana cannot be uninstalled.  Dell Assist and other Dell bloatware must be removed in Setttings &gt; Apps and Features.  
<br />
<br />See Steps here for managing storage drives:

<br />
<br />If this is for Fall Creators Update Version 1709, you can install Media Creation tool on another PC to create the bootable media or download ISO, transfer to target PC, open media or click on ISO to Mount it, right click Setup to Run as Admin.
<br />
<br />If any problems then follow these steps for Overcoming Upgrade Hurdles:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Hey there Alkapone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good question!</p>
<p>Typically, you cannot start subscriptions like Game Pass or EA Access without a payment instrument that can be set up for auto-renewal. You should be able to buy most games and in game currency though.
</p>

<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - How can I force a rescan of system before trying upgrade again</h2>
                    <p>A clean upgrade report was received but the upgrade process fails as now shows an incompatable app. Fixed that issue (I believe) by uninstalling the app. But need a clean rescan to be sure the upgrade process will move forward as it always reports the same
 problem exists and then fails yet again.</p>
<p>So can I rescan to see if the problem is still showing before wasting time attempting the upgrade</p>

<p>Yes, I am referring to the "get Windows 10 app/process" to upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10.</p>
<p>When the scan first ran it shows all hardware compatible and no issues with installed software or data and files.</p>
<p>Drivers, updates, etc. are all current. </p>
<p>Existing system runs fine. </p>
<p>When upgrading... Anti-virus is disabled, usb external devices are disabled and physically disconnected.</p>
<p>During the upgrade, it stops on the need "to uninstall these apps during the upgrade", listing only Nero- Burning Rom" as the only software it detects as not compatible with Win 10.</p>
<p>This software, which is completely updated and current from the vendor, was uninstalled to meet the upgrade requirement.</p>
<p>The upgrade failed. Was restarted with the same result even though the Nero application suite is completely uninstalled and all files refering to Nero anything have been removed from all file systems.</p>
<p>I think the upgrade software does not check the complete system again and fails again because it thinks the problem still exists.</p>
<p>I know I can rescan again but why if it really doesn't really rescan from scratch.</p>
<p>I note from previous Microsoft support answers on the forum that &nbsp;the upgrade system pre-check only runs from MIcrosoft remotely (not locally run software) just once a month (although the resulting report is apparently stored locally).
</p>
<p>So in frustration I will wait a month and see if the report results change. </p>
<p>But I think the upgrade process is flawed and a waste of my time.</p>
<p>I followed the link you noted but I do not see a clear description of how to run a "clean" update report that doesn't report on "not compatible software" that doesn't now exist.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>the /showplaces command line no longer seems to work on my desktop version of skype version 7.40.0.151.&nbsp; &nbsp;when I type it in it returns the message "you have 0 online endpoints".&nbsp; &nbsp;It returns this same message on both my android tablet and android phone.&nbsp;
 Just three days ago it would show my 3 connected devices when I typed in the command.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Does anyone have any sort of explanation for this?</p>
