<h2>            Windows 7 Fails to Boot - &#34;autochk program not found, skipping autocheck&#34;</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
I'm completely lost with this problem and the internet is not helping so I figured I'd post here in the hopes that someone can help me.<br />
<br />
A couple weeks ago, I bought a new 7200rpm hard drive for my laptop to replace the 5400rpm one it came with. Cloned the disk, stuck it in. This laptop had a Windows Vista 32 bit partition, a Windows 7 64 bit partition, and an extended partition with several
 Linux ext3 partitions. I had kept Vista around in case I needed to use something that didn't have 64 bit drivers (mostly just TI connect), but now that I had two copies of it (I haven't yet reformatted the old drive) I figured last weekend that I'd delete
 the Vista partition on the new drive and extend my 7 partition backwards to reclaim some space. I knew that some of the boot files were on the Vista partition, and sure enough it didn't boot after deleting that partition so after I deleted it I ran the Windows
 7 system recovery to install the boot files to the 7 partition. Rebooted, so far so good. Then I tried to extend the partition leftward to fill in the space that the Vista partition used, but after rebooting I keep getting this error:<br />
<br />
"autochk program not found, skipping autocheck"<br />
<br />
After which it seems to bluescreen for a split second before rebooting. The files are more or less all there, from what I can tell. I've tried using system recovery from the 7 install disk to no avail. It just says no problems found. Any ideas what could be
 causing this problem? A lot of results online mention security software like Norton causing this problem, but I've never used any of the programs mentioned. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Worst case though, I'll jsut reclone the old hard drive and
 then copy over the documents I edited in the intermediate two weeks.

<p><span><span><span>Hi Ibrahim Awwal,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try to run a check disk for the drives and let it repair them.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp; Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp; At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chkdsk /R X:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: In this command, X: is a placeholder that represents the drive letter of the volume that you want to check.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp; Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.&nbsp; Close all applications, and then restart the computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then Windows starts.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.&nbsp; After the computer restarts, repeat steps 1 through 4 for the other volume, and then rerun the backup operation.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

 that helps.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>For your ISATAP adapters<br />
You can safely ignore this error message. This error message does not indicate a problem with the adapter. The adapter will continue to work correctly. If you cannot connect to the internet, you have another problem, perhaps your wireless adapter needs updating.</p>
<p><br />
See this:<br />
On a Windows Vista-based computer or on a Windows Server 2008-based computer, the Microsoft ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in Device Manager, and you also receive an error message<br />

<p><br />
For your DVDRAM:</p>
<p>What is the device's status? Right click the device, Properties, General tab.</p>
<p>What's the problem you are encountering with the drive? Can the drive read and write in medias?</p>
<p>Is the drive appearing in Windows Explorer?</p>

References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays

    <title>Erase Personal Data off of Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lockedgazelle13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erase Personal Data off of Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am planning on selling my old 360 soon but I wanted to make sure all of my personal data was cleared first. Even without a hard drive attached, it still shows my PC's name when I go to the picture library or video library. Is there any way to remove this?
 Perhaps some type of system wipe/re-format? I can't find anything for the system itself - all I can find is how to reformat hard drives.</p>
<p>Help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>To my knowledge there isn't a factory reset on the Xbox 360 system.&nbsp; So it may not be possible to remove your PC name from the console.&nbsp; Not that it matters anyway, the Xbox 360 can only access files from a PC over a local area network.&nbsp; Rest assured,&nbsp;the
 next person who gets your old console will not be able to access your PC videos and pictures.</p>

<p>Reformatting the hard drive like Cyber Monkey316 said,&nbsp;should bring it back to the factory default or whatever. I've never done it, though I probably should have when I sold my old 360 to gamestop years ago. Oh well, it seemed to be fine.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update to 1809 has caused computer to NOT sleep.</h2>
                    <p>Puzzled as to why my PC no longer sleeps.&nbsp; If I try to put it to sleep via the task bar sleep power button or the power configuration default timer... it starts the sleep... pauses a few seconds and then wakes up.&nbsp; This started somewhere between the1809
 update going in and the the New Year.&nbsp; since 1809 their were the .net updates and then the last security update KB4483235 on Dec 20. I suspect it was around this time this started.&nbsp; When I ask if updates are pending it says the machine is fully uptodate.&nbsp;
 The only other thing that was installed around this time was Spotify from the Microsoft store which I have since removed but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run powercfg -requests I get this :&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXECUTION:<br />
[SERVICE] \Device\HarddiskVolume3\Windows\System32\svchost.exe (InstallService)<br />
Windows Update is installing apps or updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to fix this would be appreciated.&nbsp; I can system restore to dec 20 when the last security update went in but I have no idea if this is the cause.&nbsp; It says installed successfully though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any input.</p>

            Hi Ed
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit 
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />You likely need to update your BIOS, Display Driver, Chipset driver if the above does not work.

<p>the system sku line is blank.&nbsp; this machine is an Acer Aspire xc-704 running&nbsp;BIOS Version/Date&nbsp;American Megatrends Inc. R01-B3, 2017-03-23.&nbsp; and SMBIOS Version&nbsp;2.8 and has been flawless till this point.</p>
<p>It has 8 GB ram and an Intel J3710 cpu.&nbsp; Happy to supply any other missing info. My documentation shows that the unit has Acer Part number is&nbsp;<span>DT.B3YAA.001</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your command is accepted by the unit.&nbsp; running -requests again right after shows no power requests.&nbsp; I then put the machine too sleep manually from the task bar.&nbsp; 15 seconds later it wakes up.&nbsp; As soon as it woke up I reran Powercfg -requests and it said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PERFBOOST:<br />
[DRIVER] Legacy Kernel Caller<br />

<p>
</p><p>3 minutes later i rerun requests and there are NO requests active. Put it to sleep again.&nbsp; this time it wakes up in about 4 seconds not 15. -requests repeats cycle shown above.</p>

            Hi Ed
<br />
<br />I noticed there is a BIOS update for your computer from July 2017. Try applying that:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/BIOS/BIOS/BIOS_Acer_R01.B3_A_A.zip?acerid=636358558461220362&amp;Step1=DESKTOP&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE%20XC-704&amp;OS=ALL&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/BIOS/B...</a>

<p>Puzzling.&nbsp; Why are you recommending that I install the same firmware that the data I supplied to you and you requested shows as already being installed on this system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is generally much simpler than the line of thinking you are on imho.&nbsp; It probably has more to do with either the last security update&nbsp;<span>KB4483235</span> from Microsoft being borked again... or a problem with the Spotify app in the
 Microsoft store that I put on about the same time having a bug or a hidden virus that keeps the computer awake while communicating with botnets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to block internet access to this computer's IP and see how that changes the behaviour..right after I trace all the IP connections it makes after booting. &nbsp; but I think the simplest course of action at this point is to remove&nbsp;<span>KB4483235
 and see if that changes anything.&nbsp; I see system restore can put me back to the state I was in before that update went in... so I will go with that and let you know if it worked.&nbsp; Thanks for your suggestions.</span></p>

<p>Ok so the system restore is done. The sleep problem is resolved.&nbsp; <span>
KB4483235 is removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This system restore I understand has removed any changes done by the Microsoft store app Spotify and the earlier Microsoft update
<span>KB4483235</span><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>As removing just the Spotify did not solve the problem there must be a bug in
<span>KB4483235 that prevents sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your input.&nbsp; I will monitor this unit for the next little while and see if it comes back.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. There is a possibility <span>that some third-party software products causes Explorer.exe to crash repeatedly. We would like to verify if the issue also happens in clean boot state. We recommend to follow the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to start your PC in clean boot, it will load Windows </span>by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope to hear from you soon.</span></p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "answer" above is one of the "not so smart ones", and the information that you provided doesn't help at all. And is it a human beeing or a computer that suggests to post this question in a Windows 8 Technet forum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Two factor authentication" is nothing that is exclusive to Windows 10 Enterprise. It's a feature that is advertised for all Windows 10 Versions.
</p>
<p>Can you please tell us if "two factor authentication" is available today (as advertised from Microsoft), or if it is just vaporware at present?</p>

<h2>            The Windows 10 Update menu is blank. The dots keep scrolling forever.</h2>
                    Windows 10 Pro. <br />
<br />
The Windows Update menu is blank. The dots keep scrolling forever. When I move my mouse over the empty space the cursor changes to ahand when it moves over an area where there should be a button, but nothing is visible. I tried letting it sit for hours but
 when I got back to it the only thing that had changed was that the dots had stopped moving. The system works fine otherwise and I'm able to install updates manually (for example the Intel CPU weakness update).<br />
<br />
I have tried the Windows Update toubleshooting app several times with no luck. Rebooting doesn't help, obviously. I guess I may have to just wait until MS updates their Windows Update App.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Skype stores all of your contacts centrally in our cloud so you can access them when you sign in on any device or platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign in to Skype but don't see any of your contacts appearing, it is most likely because you're signed in to a different account. As a suggestion, please sign out of Skype, then sign back in using your correct Skype Name, email, or phone number.
 For more information why contacts are missing in Skype, please visit this support article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34814/why-are-my-skype-contacts-or-credit-missing?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Why are my Skype contacts or credit missing?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Calling phone numbers in Skype requires users to have Skype Credits or a calling plan on their respective accounts. Once you have found your account with your contacts, you need to simply call them on their Skype accounts and not their phones to make sure
 you'll not be asked for Skype Credits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further help.</p>

            Absolutely. &nbsp;I'd speculate that you have a program in your Startup folder that runs every time you turn on your computer. &nbsp;This program probably created that log file and placed it there because that's the folder the program is in. &nbsp;So every time you turn
 on your computer, that log file is opening.
<div><br />
<div>It's 100% safe to delete.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>To keep the problem from happening again, I'd ask: &nbsp;do you indeed have a program in your Startup folder that is running every time you turn on your computer? &nbsp;if so, move that program somewhere else, then put a
<i>shortcut</i>&nbsp;to it in the Startup folder instead. &nbsp;Then any log file will be created somewhere else, away from the Startup folder.</div>

<h3> perplexed user99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing a recycle bin on an external drive</h2>
                    <p>I have an external drive that I keep plugged into my Windows 10 desktop. It is the drive I use for my Windows Back up. It seems that the back up&nbsp;programme 'deletes' files to the hidden recycle bin folder on that drive. I know there are files on this drive
 because my virus scanner scans them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want these files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to configure a recycle bin on my external harddrive so that is a) has zero space or b) is bypassed. See image:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b490883-4a97-4ab0-ae81-bf19deda3bfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b490883-4a97-4ab0-ae81-bf19deda3bfb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing if I choose the option by selecting properties in the recycle bin on my desk top, this will apply to all deleted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that I can unhide systems files to see $recycle.bin and Recycler on the external drive, but I cannot delete them without a lot of playing about. I would really like to bypass this activity and just delete the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternative would be for the files to show up in the main recycle bin, but they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your external hard drive has its own recycle bin folder where the deleted files from it are stored. In order to delete those deleted files, we need to access first the recycle bin folder of the external hard drive. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>At the top menu, click <strong>View</strong>.</li><li>On the right pane, click <strong>Options &gt; Change folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>In the Folder options window, click the <strong>View </strong>tab.</li><li>Under the <em>Advanced settings</em>, tick or select <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Hide protected operating system files</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once saved, try to access your external hard drive. Its recycle bin should now be visible. You may then open the recycle bin folder and delete the files inside it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I know how to do this, but would rather not have to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus the deleting part is very onerous as I have to (in no particular order) change the access from 'read only', log in as the administrator, turn off the application that is using the data, then I can delete. Then I have to reset all the settings, as I
 want the application (File History) on and I&nbsp;don't want to see protected operating system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, I am afraid I do need further help, please</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. Is your external hard drive detected as a local drive? If it's detected as a local drive, you may be able to run a disk cleanup to clear the deleted files on your recycle bin. Just right-click the specific drive, then click
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>. Once in the <em>Disk Cleanup</em> window, check
<strong>Recycle Bin</strong> in the Files to delete, then click <strong>OK</strong>. Please see the photos below:</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive does show in the system cleanup app, but shows the recycle bin as empty. Hence my original question: is there a way of configuring a recycle bin on my hard drive so I can delete the files in the $recycle.bin folder.</p>

<p>Since the disk cleanup shows the recycle bin is empty, there's a possibility that the deleted files are no longer available and that the bin it is really empty. One way to verify that is by unhiding the system files and manually check the deleted items in
 the external hard drive's recycle bin.<br />
<br />
With regard to the option shown in the photo below, the changes will only apply to the deleted files in that specific drive that you modified.</p>

<h2>            Command Prompt Randomly Opens and Closes</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for the past month(?), at between midnight and 1:30am, the command prompt pops up for an instance and then disappears almost instantly. I've looked at the event log and can't find anything linked to those times. There aren't any suspicious programs running
 and I check the task manager everytime this happens. It has me paranoid that there is a virus on my computer but I did a full system scan with Bitdefender 2016, Latest version of Malwarebytes, adwcleaner, Spybot Search and Destroy, etc, all of which pop up
 nothing. So either this virus is very sneaky or it is a natural process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what could possibly be causing it as it seems to have started randomly, I've check the task scheduler and these tasks are linked to around that time:</p>
<p>Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser,</p>
<p>RacTask</p>
<p>BackgroundUploadTask</p>
<p>Maintenance Configurator</p>
<p>Those seem to be the only 4 that fit the criteria of running at those times but I don't know what these do nor whether they open the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea what on earth is happening and how to fix it that would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

<h2>            Mail app&#58; How to remove email addresses from Favorites list</h2>
                    <p>While trying to help someone understand the different manifestations of "users/contacts" between mail, phone contacts, Skype, etc., I managed to inadvertently add some accounts to my Favorites in the Mail App and do not see a means to manage that list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repro:</p>
<p>1. Mail configured to connect to Hotmail</p>
<p>2. In left pane of Mail App, select People. Flyout with 'Favorites' and 'Frequent' overlays on top of the inbox view of messages.</p>
<p>3. Magic happens here...I do something that I cannot recall or repro...vague&nbsp;recollection is that I clicked on a couple of the accounts for friends from the 'Frequent' list and they end up in the Favorites list&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. There is no obvious way to remove users from the Favorites list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to the People app, all of the users in my Mail app's Favorites list do *not* have the Favorites icon lit up. Selecting and De-selecting the Favorite icon in the People app does nothing to my list of 'Favorites' in the Mail app. What notion of&nbsp;contacts
 is this app synching to???</p>

            <span>Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
When you pin a person to your Start screen, that person's profile picture and their Facebook status updates and Tweets will appear as a tile on Start. Tap or click the tile to get to their contact info. You can then quickly send them a text message or an email,
 or call, chat, or get on a video call with them on Skype.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link on how to add/remove favorites from people app.<br />
<br />
People app help (Pin people and add/remove favorites)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/people-app-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/people-app-faq</a><br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
1.On Start, tap or click&nbsp;Mail app;&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>2.Tap or click the person you want to remove from favorites.</span><span><br />
</span><span>3.Tap or click Favorite. When you go back to the home page of the&nbsp;mail app, you will no longer see this person under your list of favorites.</span><span><br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

    <title>Black screen after logging in to domain account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catnapped  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after logging in to domain account</h2>
                    Ok, this is making me nutty and I don't know what to do.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Setup: Domain controller running SB Server 2008. &nbsp;4 connected client machines, 2 running XP, 2 running Vista Ultimate SP1. &nbsp;XP machines are running fine (of course). &nbsp;Vista machines are in the tank.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both Vista machines are approximately 2 weeks old, with the only modifications to the factory install being Office, Norton 360, and printer drivers. &nbsp;Both machines are exhibiting the same symptons at the same time:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) After reboot, each Vista machine spins for exactly 10 minutes saying "Please wait..." before presenting the "Hit Control-Alt-Delete" screen. &nbsp;Booting into Safe Mode works normally. &nbsp;Examining the eventlog, I see entries about running a startup script
 of some kind that took 600 seconds (10 minutes). &nbsp;This is obviously coming from the Domain controller. &nbsp;What is it and how do I get rid of it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) After finally logging on, attempts to log in to domain account ("domain\name") result in a "Welcome..." screen, followed by a black screen with a mouse cursor that is movable. &nbsp;This is a permanent condition. &nbsp;I have let the machines sit overnight and
 nothing changes. &nbsp;I get an occasional popup on the black screen from Norton saying that it is running background tasks, and that's it, so I know the machines are running. &nbsp;Hitting Control-alt-del does *not* bring up the security screen. &nbsp;It does nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note that logging in to a *local* account ("machinename\name") works fine. &nbsp;I get a desktop, icons, everything. &nbsp;I even logged in locally and did a "Switch User" to a domain account, and now the machine is stuck again dead at a black screen with movable
 mouse.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both machines were running fine for two weeks. &nbsp;When I reboot to Safe Mode and remove the machine from the domain, everything works fine, probably because I'm just logging in to a local account again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made *no* changes to group policy. &nbsp;The server is operating with all default settings wrt updates, etc. &nbsp;I have not made any system mods to the clients other than joining them to the domain.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched online, and I see other people have this problem, but I cannot find a definitive solution. &nbsp;I have tried rebooting using Last Known Good, but I think the system believes that the last logon was successful so that does no good. &nbsp;Going back
 to the last Restore Point does no good. &nbsp;Both machines tanked at the same time which implies a domain-wide problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please don't tell me I have to spend $200 and a day online with product support to get an answer to this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.</div>

            Hi Mr. Bob,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />The most likely cause of unexpected shutdowns is your hardware. Indicates a dirty/improper shutdown. Appears in the log when the previous shutdown was unexpected, e.g. due to power loss or BSoD (Bug check).
<br />
<br />Suggest you start with basics.
<br />
<br />Check your disk(s).
<br />Try Hard Disk Sentinel (trial) - excellent, else HD Tune Health and Error scan tabs and post the (GUI) results. HD Tune also has a portable version. Both ok for SSDs.
<br />
<br />If your system disk is ok, please run
<br />chkdsk c: /F
<br />from an admin command prompt.
<br />Your PC will need to restart.
<br />
<br />Waiting to hearing from you       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for your reply&nbsp;<span>Leocadia&nbsp;</span>- I understand your suggestions thank you.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is our Win 10 Pro v1803 computers, log Event ID 6008 when an unexpected crash happens. However we have Win 10 pro v1809 machines that crashed when the power failed and did not record an Event ID 6008 so I was not able to tell
 when the power actually failed, only when they were rebooted. - so my question is :- is this a bug in the 1809 release or by Microsoft design and has anybosy else experienced this situation ??</p>
<p>thanks Bob, IT Manager, Henry Riley LLP.</p>

<p>Summarising from that, it looks like the recent update is borking the Twitter connection. I used this link&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.live.com/cid-27a6342ef735cc0f/Services/?view=manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://profile.live.com/cid-27a6342ef735cc0f/Services/?view=manage</a>&nbsp;to
 delete my Facebook and Twitter profile connections (my Google connection is still ok). The People app started working again after a reboot. Hopefully MS will fix it soon so I can have the Twitter connection back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ORIGINAL ISSUE BELOW THIS LINE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built-in People app on my Surface Pro 3, running Windows 8.1, won't load today (30 June 2015). Was working recently. Now when I try to open it I get the usual splash screen, then it vanishes and goes back to the start page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I assumed it was me, as I recently installed Outlook 2013 so I could import a contact file that was emailed to me and sync it to People. I also recently switched to Google two-factor authentication, which is also connected to People. But I note
 from the Windows Store app that the&nbsp;Mail, Calendar and People app was updated yesterday and that a few other users are giving 1 star reviews which state People broke for them too (4 reviews dated June 27 to June 30, for example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account at People.live.com seems to be OK though, as are the contacts on my Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can read the minidump files yourself with the FREE utility from Nirsoft below.<br />
<br />
The main likely causes for this error are hard drive issues, memory and/or malware infections
<br />
though there are others. Read through the troubleshooter here and look in the Event Viewer,
<br />
check the 2nd parameter of the BBCode with the BlueScreenView utility and when you get to
<br />
the various suggested repair methods check the next message for more details for each.
<br />
Remember to report back here the info from Event Viewer and the BlueScreenViewer.<br />
<br />
BCCode: 77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000077<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>If the first parameter is 0 or 1, the stack signature in the kernel stack was not found. This error is probably caused by defective hardware, such as a RAM error.
<strong>Your parameter is 1.</strong></p>
<p>If the first parameter is 2, the driver stack returned an inconsistent status for the read of the page. For example, the driver stack returned a success status even though it did not read the whole page.</p>
<p>If the first parameter is any value other than 0, 1, or 2, the value of the first parameter is an NTSTATUS error code that the driver stack returns after it tries to retrieve the page of kernel data. You can determine the exact cause of this error from the
 I/O status code (the second parameter). Some common status codes include the following:</p>
<strong>&lt;!----&gt;</strong>
<ul>
<li>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources. This status code indicates a driver error in the storage stack. (The storage stack should always be able to retrieve this data, regardless of software resource availability.)
</li><li>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.
</li><li>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk drive.
</li><li>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.
</li><li>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.
</li></ul>
<p>&lt;!----&gt;</p>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that might be returned, see the
<em>Ntstatus.h</em> file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a bad block problem:</em> If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs automatically and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore.</p>
<p>If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the system because the error, use the Recovery Console and run
<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the integrity of your
 hard disk drive from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of the Windows operating system.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a defective hardware problem:</em> If the I/O status is 0xC0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a failing RAM problem:</em> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p>Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p>If the preceding steps fail to resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a virus infection:</em> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.<br />

This is my generic troubleshooter and can probably give a little more specific help when you give the
<br />
BCC codes.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info
<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error
<br />
information such as STOP&nbsp;codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party

keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><span><span>Hello LoriMT,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since when are you getting blue screen errors on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer before getting this error?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are getting errors related to Disk inconsistency, I suggest that you run CHKDSK on your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you run CHKDSK on your computer, if there are any bad sectors on the hard disk. Click on start and type CMD, Right click and
 ‚ÄòRun as Administrator. At the command prompt, type: <br />
<br />
chkdsk [drive:] [/p] | [/r]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>[drive:] Specifies the drive to check.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>/p Check even if the drive is not flagged dirty, bad.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>/r Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information (implies /p).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disclaimer: Performing this task could cause loss of data on your computer. It is recommended that you back up all the data and files prior to performing
 this.</span></span></p>

<h2>            error 0x0000185 Acer One 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer One 10 I bought last summer and have maybe only used it a handful of times since I didn't much care for it. &nbsp;Tonight I tried to start it and once it ran the "Acer" start up screen, it won't go beyond it other than to go to Aptio Setup Utility,
 or it gives me the "Windows failed to start..." and the error code 0x0000185. It also plays a screen that shows "Recovery" at the top ...recommending I use the recovery tools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss...I do not have my Windows 8 disc as I did not receive one for this tablet...so what can I do? &nbsp;Can I download what I need from Microsoft on another computer (though my laptop is only running Windows 7)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to boot the computer. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The error message&nbsp;you are getting is clearly&nbsp;mentioned that the boot configuration of your computer is missing or&nbsp;corrupted so I would suggest you to perform an Automatic Repair and check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Automatic Repair can detect corrupted System Files and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the Windows 8 installation disc to perform an Automatic Repair. If you don‚Äôt have a Windows
 8 disc, I would suggest you to download the Windows 8 installation files from another computer through this link and choose to create an installation media when the upgrade assistant prompts.</span></p>
