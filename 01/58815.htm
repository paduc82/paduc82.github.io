                    <p>I've reproduced this multiple times and can find no explanation for it. Cortana works like a charm

<p>OMG! Are you serious? So there isn't a tiny woman buried in all the millions of units Windows shipped since 8/1/2012, all bound together by some form of quantum entanglement, and I've just been&nbsp;anthropomorphizing all this time? Wow. Unfortunately, this doesn't

            Hi Roy, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like some of the files behind Cortana may have corrupted, or some Cortana related settings aren't correct.
<br />
<br />You can usually fix these issues by reinstalling Cortana manually through PowerShell.
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions you can follow:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/96116-reinstall-re-register-cortana-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/96116-reins...</a>
<br />
<br />Reboot, then let me know if you need further help after try this!

<h2>            Bing 404 error, cannot use &#33;bing for search</h2>
                    
<p>If I go here, <a href="http://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bing.com/</a>&nbsp;I get a 400 error. If I try to use bing or bing live from my tool bar I get a 400 error. I use bing as a search engine on my website and it often won't load. My wife's computer, side by
 side with mine, loads bing just fine.</p>
<p>Is this some kind of anti-bing virus?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Can you get to other search engines such as Google? What is malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

    <title>Wireless comfort Keyboard 5000&#47;Win7x32&#47;some keys not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbydrake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless comfort Keyboard 5000&#47;Win7x32&#47;some keys not working</h2>
                    I just bought the wireless comfort kb and mouse combo.&nbsp; The mouse worked perfectly right out of the box but the kb has not.<br />
<br />
Most of the keys work except for q,w,e,a,s,d,k, . , the space works sometimes.&nbsp; I noticed when I toggled F lock on and off the e key would work sometimes but then stop soon after.<br />
<br />
I have read every post I could find here.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling after un installing and reboot.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling under the generic term "Wireless comfort keyboard" leaving out the 5000 part.<br />
<br />
I tried taking the batteries in and out.&nbsp; I didn't see any reset buttons on the USB part or the kb itself so it led me to believe it's hard wired to the reciever.&nbsp; I disconnected and unplugged my router completely so it isn't that either.<br />
<br />
I tried different USB ports, I tried putting the KB as close as possible to the USB receiver.&nbsp; I tried everything suggested on this site so far or everything I could find.&nbsp; I checked the settings in control panel and in the comfort section.
<br />
<br />
The item is brand new I just got home from the store with it.&nbsp; Needless to say this is frustrating after fighting boxing day crowds.<br />
<br />
My pc is an AMD Ath IIx2 4000+, 2GB RAM, ASUS MA785-m MB, ATI radeon 3870 GPU, Nothing special.<br />
<br />
I dont want to take this back as I like it very much and the mouse works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Oh It's a Wireless Comfort Keyboard Model number 1394<br />

            <p>Hi BB -</p>
<p>Start by going to <strong>start - settings - personalization </strong>and choose 'lock screen'. In the dropdown box below 'Preview' - deselect Windows Spotlight and select 'Picture' - if you do not want one of the pre-installed images you can select one
 of your choice by&nbsp;clicking on 'Browse'. Exit from the lock screen settings. If you want to try 'Spotlight' again at some point simply reverse the process - de-select 'Picture' and choose 'Windows Spotlight'.</p>
<p>Cheers - Ric.</p>

<p>It just says that my codes are invalid. But, I already know the problem; my live account billing was set to UK and the prices of Uk Ms points are different than the prices of America. So, what I did was just to make another live account(free) and just set
 the billing to US, then I tried redeeming the codes again and they worked.</p>
<p>I just wanted to get toy soldiers anyway.</p>

<h2>            Pictures do not display as thumbnail preview</h2>
                    <p><span>In Windows 7, I can't get pictures to show as thumbnail previews. I've tried three different methods suggested on this site. Why is this so difficult?__</span></p>
<p><span>The three methods I've tried are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open the folder in Windows Explorer and click the
<strong><span>down arrow</span></strong> next to <strong><span>Views</span></strong> at the top.&nbsp; Choose
<strong><span>Medium icons</span></strong> and see if the thumbnails start working again.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If not, click on <strong><span>Organize</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Folder and Search Options</span></strong>.&nbsp; Click the <strong><span>View tab</span></strong>.&nbsp; Make sure that "<strong><span>Always show icons, never thumbnails</span></strong>"
<strong><span>does not</span></strong> have a check mark next to it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Control Panel. (Classic View). Click on the System icon. Click on the advanced system settings link. Under Performance, click on the Settings button. In the Visual Effects tab, Check "Show thumbnails
 instead of icons.”</span></p>

<p>Not sure where these answers were going but to simply make your pictures show in thumbnail mode in win7 simply open your pictures folder, click tools, folder options, view, then uncheck "Always show icons, never thumbnails"</p>
<p>Don't forget to hit apply!</p>
<p>That should do it.</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

                    have a friend who has (or had) this partially installed on her laptop. using remote assistance to alleviate her troubles. her laptop is a dell, bought refurbished and the system image (when installing a fresh copy of windows) contains a PARTIAL install
 of eset nod32 and personal firewall miniport. help removing these would be greatly appreciated. they are interfering with her wireless connectivity, and are unnecessary as she uses mse as anti virus/spam.

            Can you try installing the driver with compatibility mode (using Vista)?<br />
<br />
1. Right click on the .EXE (installer to install) and select Properties<br />
2. Compatibility tab -&gt; "Run the program..."<br />
3. Select Windows Vista, and click OK<br />
4. Try running the installer.<br />
<br />
You might also want to visit and post your question in the TechNet forum since this might be better suited for your needs.<br />

<p>Once you have access to a large data storage format like CD-ROM on your computer, however, you would also like to have the ability to write data to those discs yourself. The two CD formats for writing to CD discs are CD-R (Recordable) and CD-RW (ReWritable),
<strong>where recordable discs can be written once</strong>, and rewritable or re-recordable discs can written, and then re-used by erasing and writing again.&nbsp; Actually, while CD-R Recordable discs are write-once, you can write to different areas on the disc
 at different times, so you can write a portion of the disc, and then later append more data to the disc. In CD terminology, this is described as keeping the disc open, then writing multiple sessions, and then closing the disc when you are done with it. These
 days, you do not need to use a special application to write data to a CD, but instead can install an operating system extension that lets you drag and drop to copy individual files to the disc.<br />
<br />
But CD-R discs are not just for data; you can also burn music files to CD-R discs in CD-Audio format that can be played on CD audio players. To do this, you use a audio authoring tool to prepare the songs you want to record in the audio data proper format,
 and then burn the disc in one operation with the song data and other control information required for CD-Audio playback. Now that lingering compatibility problems with early generation CD drives have been overcome, you can expect to be able to read and play
 any retail CD audio disc on any PC CD-ROM drive, and also be able to take CD-R discs that you burned on a PC and play them on a CD audio player. Compatibility has been more of a problem with CD-RW discs, but they should work fine with recent players.<br />
<br />
The point here is that a CD-R can only be written <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
once</span>.&nbsp; What you want to do requires a CD-RW.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure why you can't delete the folders exactly as you did the files (in fact, I'm not really sure how you were able to delete the files), but it may have something to do with the fact that it
 is a CD-R and not a CD-RW.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Just purchased Windows 10, Shows I purchased it, Not showing up on my content</h2>
                    I just purchased windows 10 (digital + key) in the store, got through the entire process and charged on my credit card.&nbsp; Under the store Order History and Digital Content its saying I didn't purchase anything.&nbsp; If I go under my Microsoft account (https://account.microsoft.com)
 it says I purchased it and shows me where it was purchased today.&nbsp; Where can I get the link to my download and key?&nbsp; Nothing was sent to me in the email and every time I try to call customer support the robot just redirects me and hangs up on me.

I visited the website you posted here, the first link. <br />

                    Hi, I have just completed a clean install of Vista ultimate 64 bit.&nbsp; My system also had xp and windows 7 installed.&nbsp; I have removed win 7 but when i startup it still shows up in the list of operating sytems to boot.<br />
<br />
I know i need to go at it through a DOS prompt and BCDEDIT but i cant figure out how to then remove the windows 7 entry completely.<br />

Any help would be appreciated.<br />

Take a look at the following KB article.&nbsp; The subject of the KB may not be what is happening on your machine, but it gives detailed steps how to rebuild the boot load options using BCDEDIT.<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi theshite,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Which operating system is installed on your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Yes, you will need driver software for the device to work with your computer. You may refer to the below provided
 link and check for product FAQ’s and troubleshooting steps. You can also check for compatible driver software at the manufacturer support website -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.nyko.com/customer-support/product-support.html?platform=PC&amp;name=AirFlo+EX+for+PC%2FMac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.nyko.com/customer-support/product-support.html?platform=PC&amp;name=AirFlo+EX+for+PC%2FMac</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Also I would suggest you to check if the product is compatible to be used with the operating system installed on your
 computer. You may also contact the manufacturer support for further assistance on the issue -</span></strong></p>

            Hi Dannyboy65
<br />
<br />Check in your Recycle bin to see if that file is there
<br />
<br />If not, you will need a 3rd party utility to try to bring that file back, try the free version of Recuva:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1-If you lost or deleted files from your Windows 10 desktop, you can try to restore them from the recycle bin. You can open the recycle bin, choose files inside and right-click them by choosing "Restore"
<br />
<br />
<br />2-If you can't find any files in the recycle bin, you may try this method. Create an exact same file with the same name of lost files. Check "Properties", choose "Previous Version" and select the right file version to restore. It requires you to remember all the lost files names. And this may not work for restoring some media files like videos or audios. But if you want to restore document files, this will help.
<br />
<br />
<br />Good luck....       
        </p>

            If a file is deleted in Windows 10, it goes into Recycle bin.
<br />
<br />Can you look into Recycle bin and see whether the file is there or not? If yes, restore from there.
<br />
<br />If this is not in Recycle bin, you can try free version of Recuva to recover the file (note - it is not always successful, hence you require some luck also)

<p>On all other versions of Windows, your response <em>(<span>If a file is deleted in Windows 10, it goes into Recycle bin) would be great. However, I have never been able to find the Recycle bin, even when I follow the directions for settings.</span></em></p>
