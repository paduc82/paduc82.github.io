<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Missing Sleep option in Power menu is usually caused by outdated or corrupted device drivers. For us to better assist you, we would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>When you check the Power options in Control Panel, did you mean that the Sleep option is not displaying in the Shutdown settings?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't check the Shutdown settings in Control Panel, we suggest to do so and make sure that the Sleep option is enabled. To check the Shutdown settings, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Cortana </strong>search, type <strong>control panel</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the list.</li><li>Click <strong>System and Security</strong> and select <strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong> in the left pane of the window.</li><li>Under <strong>Shutdown settings</strong>, put a tick in the <strong>Sleep </strong>
box and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the Sleep option is already enabled and it still doesn't appear in the Power menu, we recommend that you keep the device drivers up-to-date. For your reference, check this article on how to

    <title>Windows 8.1 Free Upgrade&#47;Install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Free Upgrade&#47;Install</h2>
                    <p>I get getting a pop up that said to upgrade to 8.1 for free. I do not want to upgrade to 8.1 certain things I do are NOT compatible with it so I have always clicked the "remind me later" button. Wish there had been a "reject" button instead. Only recently
 did this pop up change. Somehow it downloaded this 8.1 upgrade and was now asking me when to install it. I got choices of "now"&nbsp; in "1 hour" in "2 hours" in "4 hours" or "remind me later" as before I clicked the remind me later. Eventually this choice was
 taken away from me. At one point I'm in the middle of something and suddenly I'm having to scramble to get to the windows store as it's installing windows 8.1 which I was able to catch it and cancel when it was at 50%. Sadly at some point I'm not sure how
 but it finished installing and now tells me I have to restart to basically finish the upgrade. Once again I DO NOT WANT TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8.1. Since last night, which is when it finished I have not restart or shutdown my computer. I cannot continue to
 do this and do not like to do this. So my question is there away to keep my Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into this "KB 2871389" whatever though there are two numbers that are often given this being one and I don't remember the other. Either way the two numbers I see is not the one I have. I have "KB 2565063" but I don't know if this is right or changed
 or what. If I delete this will it cancel this install I have or am I just stuck have to upgrade and then try and figure out how to get back down to Windows 8 hoping to god it doesn't royal mess up my computer? Please an answer would be greatly appreciated
 and quickly.</p>

            <p>I find this highly unlikely simply for the fact that they still support windows 7 if they were going to fade out Windows 8 I would figured 7 would be gone first and 8 only recently came out. Not to mention that 8.1 is far more "buggy" then windows 8. Not
 to mention there are still many people using windows 8 so I do not buy this "Windows 8 is being faded out" BS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is indeed true find me an article from Microsoft that indeed says so and then I will believe you until then no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Also if this was indeed true why the heck are there other threads on how to stop the download and pop up of going to 8.1? I'm sorry I just don't believe it. So please prove me wrong find me that article</p>

            I don't know why you think the updates are buggier than the non updated version. We've been using 8.1 for more than a year in our entire enterprise environment. If you want me to research for you you can check my website for my prices and hire me. Otherwise,
 enjoy.

            <p>Okay first of just because it's NOT being sold in stores anymore does not mean that they quit supporting that system so please learn the difference between when a system is actually dropped/faded and when it is simply not sold in stores. There is a HUGE
 difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I feel it is kind of your responsibility as you are the ones here to supposedly help me with a question. There is no verification to back up for false statement that they will stop handling Windows 8 except in the fact it won't be sold in stores anymore.
 This does NOT mean that they are going to stop patching the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Shawn...Apparently you do different things with your 8.1 then I do and you've probably been lucky so I'm happy for you. Though I think more maybe you're being paid off or just won't of those people that always has to get the latest and greatest thing
 even if it's not. Really you're going to make a comparison like that? First off a Ferrari is very different and so many ways you can call that out, but this is not a forum for that so I will not get into that. Good day.</p>

                    The computer turns on fine and everything, but then it automatically displays "Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\msspi.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and the try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click
 Search". This computer was just randomly given to us, with nothing but the tower. I was just going to clean it up by removing unwanted programs and such, but everytime I click Add or Remove Programs, it says 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe Application not
 found'. So then I tried to do a system restore, but I don't know if it's possible without a Windows CD (which we do not have). And everytime I try to open Firefox, it says Open With: Recommended Program, etc... so I click Firefox and it prompts me to save
 an exe file to the Local Disk which I do but it doesn't open. Whenever I try to open any MSWord files or MP3, JPEG files that are saved on the computer, it basically tells me they don't exist. So obviously this computer can't do ANYTHI

            <p>The file msspi.exe is surely a malicious file that once resided in your system32 folder. Did you recently have an infection and run an anti-malware program? If so, you are experiencing the after-effects of the infection. (Of course, it's possible there is
 another infection on your PC as well.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have backed up all your data (ask if you need guidance), you can re-establish your associations, etc. First if all, follow the directions here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://filext.com/faq/broken_exe_association.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filext.com/faq/broken_exe_association.php</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need a working PC that is online and one of those USB flash drives to transfer the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The XP reg file referenced on the above page is the same one here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(That would be the ninth link "EXE File Association Fix.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are other associations may be broken. Those fixes can be found here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://technorati.com/technology/it/article/remove-after-effects-of-virusesmalwarespyware-and/page-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technorati.com/technology/it/article/remove-after-effects-of-virusesmalwarespyware-and/page-2/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You really should run a complete scan with the latest version of MalwareBytes Anti-Malware:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(There is no need to activate the full version when given the choice. This way you will get it for free. The free version should be all you need.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, if you TRULY want your PC to have its "fresh out the factory state" (possibly not necessary but a valid choice), you need to follow the directions the manufacturer provided. If you need guidance, let us know the make, model, and model number
 of your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heh. Just re-read the post. Since this PC was given to you, you really should flatten and rebuild so it returns to its original state. I will leave these instructions for others to follow (assuming their PCs aren't used). You really do not want to take any
 chance with a used PC (e.g., a PC that is part of the "botnet," spewing forth tons of spam, keylogging programs that track your financial identities, child pornography, etc.).</p>

    <title>Software &#40;SlingPlayer&#41; will not launch properly. When I try to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hk_jhuang155  say:</h3>
<h2>            Software &#40;SlingPlayer&#41; will not launch properly. When I try to relaunch the software, I get a &#34;application already running&#34; message. How do I get the software to run properly&#63;</h2>
                    I updated my SlingPlayer software and tried to launch it after it installed. I could not get any of the page to load on my screen. I tried to relaunch the application but I got a message saying that another instance of the software is already running.
 I have tried to uninstall and reinstall 5 times already with no effect. I have searched SlingPlayers FAQ and Microsoft's FAQ on launch issues in Win7. I also encountered this issue using iTunes, but was able to roll back to an early time to successfully launch
 the app. Of course all my work done before the roll back was lost.<br />
<br />
Any idea why I can't launch the app? Am I missing a registry file or something? I cannot roll back to an earlier date than for my iTunes and now I am either going to have to reinstall Win7 or someone on this forum can give me a solution. Please help.

<p><span>Hi hk_jhuang155,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the SlingPlayer website I found that the software’s compatibility is currently compatible with Windows Vista and Windows XP.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you’ve uninstalled and re-installed the software multiple times, let’s give it a shot one last time. This time, let’s install the
 software in Windows Vista Compatibility mode. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To install the software in Windows Vista Compatibility mode,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click the installation file and select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Compatibility mode,
check the “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” option.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Select either Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) or Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) from the available options.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click Apply and OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information on compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you may also create a new
<strong>test</strong> user account and try installing the software and check what happens.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following article for more information on creating a new user account:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To create a user account</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If in the new user account, you’re able to install and run SlingPlayer without any problems, it indicates that your old user account could have
 gone corrupt. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to repair the corrupt user profile:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fix a corrupted user profile</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you continue to face issues with SlingPlayer, I’d suggest you to contact Sling Support:</span></p>

<h3> planetf1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 network - too frequently get red X and adapter disappears</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 4 with m3-6Y30. SMBIOS is 3.1, bios is 107.1741.768 13/06/2017 currently</p>
<p>I've had the system since around Jan 2017, but am finding that fairly often the network drops out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently my Marvell AVASTAR driver is Band=auto,coalesce-enabled, wake=enabled, wmm-ps=optimized with driver 15.68.9114.29 dated 09/02/2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going back to the factory image, as well as fast forwarding to the latest insider build, but across the spectrum the behaviour is consistent</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I open the surface to find the network status icon just showing a red cross</p>
<p>sometimes this happens after a little period of trying to connect (networks with a *, then lines showing connected, then cycling)</p>
<p>Usually the device manager shows the adapter as not present after this occurs</p>
<p>
</p><p>The kind of errors I see in the log include:</p>
<p>Connectivity state in standby: Disconnected, Reason: NIC compliance</p>
<p>Miniport Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller, {45f9c8af-4ce3-410e-9981-9887eccf0128}, had event Fatal error: The miniport has failed a power transition to operational power</p>
<p>Miniport Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller, {45f9c8af-4ce3-410e-9981-9887eccf0128}, had event Fatal error: The miniport has detected an internal error</p>
<p>Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller : Has determined that the network adapter is not functioning properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also seen</p>
<p>&nbsp;- 'This device cannot start / This device does not exist' in device manager (probably when I left the UI open)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gather the same chip manages Bluetooth, but this seems to work -- for example the surface pen will continue to work perfectly even when the adapter is missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a issue occurs a reboot will fix it - without moving the device etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been thinking that surely this is a driver issue, but now wondering if it could be bad hardware</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also relate to my personal config/networking, though there are two other identical SP4 and they don't appear to suffer this issue, the only difference I can think is my logged in userid - and precanned wifi config that gets pulled in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Any debug/tracing I can do on the adapter that might help? Any new firmware/driver levels? Any offline diagnostics? Or am I looking at sending in for repair/replace?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nigel.</p>

<h2>            Serious External Hard Drive Issues for Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Since the update I have been trying to use an external storage device for gaming. I was able to successfully install and connect my external drive to my xbox. Formatted it using the xbox and moved my games over no problem. I have noticed when playing randomly
 my games will crash and a notification will pop-up saying “My external device is Ready”. It would seem my xbox/EHDD are losing connection to each other? Or is this a known bug? Has anyone else who currently is connected with an external experienced similar
 problems? Through research of my own I am having a similar issue to this on the PC:&nbsp; http://blogs.msdn.com/b/usbcoreblog/archive/2013/11/01/help-after-installing-windows-8-1-my-usb-drive-disappears-or-file-transfers-stop-unexpectedly-r-a-post-title.aspx</p>
<p>This thread is more to help my troubleshoot so any input from the community is welcome.</p>
<p>My exact hard drive: Seagate Barracuda 3 TB HDD SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive (model: ST1000DM003)</p>
<p>My enclosure: StarTech 3.5in USB 3.0 Model SAT3510BU3</p>
<p>As you will note both Segate and StarTech are listed on that MSDN blog post, even though that blog post is for kernel 8.1 and the Xbox is based off a modified 8.0 kernel...</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As far as I know this isn't a known bug, I personally haven't seen this issue before.</p>
<p>Is it possible to change the usb cable you use to see if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply WPAK. Unfortunately another USB cable showed similar results. Going off my hunch I've placed an order in for an updated enclosure unit that supports and defaults to the newer USB 3.0 USB Attached SCSI instead of the older Bulk-Only Transfer
 (BOT) protocol which appears to have issues with certain devices in windows 8 (I am still toying with this being related). I'll report back for google purposes if this direction of thought fixes my issue. The lack of information and discussion on the internet
 means I am probably one of the few with this issue for the Xbox. I'll open a ticket with Xbox Support as well to at least put this on the radar. Thanks again!</p>
<p>(Though if anyone has other ideas do feel free to post!)</p>

<p>I have a WD MyBook 2TB and I have yet to see this. &nbsp;I'm not sure what causes it. &nbsp;It could have something to do with that BOT cable, I know I've had issues on my new HP Envy at home with the other external I have, but after updating to a new 3.0 cable I
 haven't had any issues. &nbsp;Definitely let us know if that fixes it. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>you can only connect the external hard drive to the usb 3.0 port on the left side of the xbox unless there is a update to support the standard usb 2.0 in the back of the xbox also are you on the xbox update preview beta or the standard regular updates there
 is a big difference because you will get a update first about a month eariler if you are on the beta preview. there will be a ton of issues with new updates so make sure your not on that unless you are ready to test updates.

<p>TL;DR - Having problems also. I give specific examples and troubleshooting I did. I'm stuck now.</p>
<p>I'm having the same issues with an external drive not working properly on the Xbox One. I was getting irritated with the tiny built-in drive, so I decided to add one of my externals to the system and see how it works. I plugged it in, formatted it, all seemed
 well. I marked a few of my games to move to the external drive. During the copy procedure, the drive would disappear from the Xbox only to reappear after a delay and a popup notification. It appeared as if the drive was being reset (just as if you had cut
 power to it or unmounted/remounted). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to cancel the moves to the external drive - and therefore had to endure the several hour copy process for the games I had marked to move over while the drive kept disconnecting over and over
 and over.</p>
<p>I happened to have a Charge &amp; Play cable plugged in to my controller during these issues (since it was taking forever due to the problem), and I noticed that each time the drive seemed to reset there was a pulse from the light on the controller as well.
</p>
<p>I tested without the charge and play connected and still had the same problems. It seems like the Xbox is sending a panic/reset signal to USB for some reason. Not that it should matter, but I have my external drive plugged into the top-rear USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p>I didn't have these issues with this drive or enclosure over the past week (had been using the same hard drive to move some files back and forth between a new computer and several older ones) and the drive doesn't disconnect or reset when plugged into my
 computers (has been moving/copying files between 3 different machines). I would give a 98% confidence level that the drive is fine and has no issues.</p>
<p>I was going to try doing a clone of the drive to another external I have in order to 100% rule out problems on the drive, but it appears the drive format is now encrypted or otherwise hidden with the patch that allows externals? I've seen videos of the original
 partition scheme, but when I plug the drive into a computer and use disk utilities to check partitions, etc... it shows as having none. So, no further troubleshooting for me it would appear.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I took the time to copy all of my data from the original external drive to a new higher quality and capacity external drive with a much higher quality enclosure that has a large heat sink for the drive. This drive and enclosure have also been used repeatedly
 over the past few weeks for file transfer, etc... and they work great. After the copy, I removed the original drive I was testing with yesterday so it wouldn't interfere.</p>
<p>I started playing a game from the new drive. While this drive seems to fail less often and is therefore infinitely more usable, it still fails in exactly the same way and did so three times in an hour and a half. And when it does, it makes sure to not save
 (obviously, the drive reset/disconnected) and would lose any progress in any game you are playing.</p>

www.dropbox.com/.../extreset_comments.mp4</a></p>
<p>So, that's two separate known good drives and enclosures. A Seagate 500GB and a Western Digital 750GB. Both fail in the same way for no apparent reason, both only do this with the Xbox One. What's the best way to submit a bug report to the developers for
 things like this?</p>

            <p>Groove is the new Music Service from Microsoft, however, Windows Media Player is a way more powerful software to manage your music library. Windows Media Player is known for decades as a great response for media demands such CD Ripping and audio converting,
 CD burning, soft equalization, visualization effects and much more. However, Windows Media Player is not an universal app, so Groove is what makes possible to stream your music on other platforms such as Windows Phone and Xbox.</p>

<h3> kaanhw  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have bought a Lenovo laptop with OEM Windows 8.1. How do I perform a vanilla re-install of Windows to remove all the extra software what came with the laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Lenovo laptop with OEM Windows 8.1. Unfortunately it comes with a host of applications and installations that I don't wont or need.</p>
<p>I have bought an SSD for the laptop and when I install it I want to install a clean version of Windows 8.1, i.e without all the pre-added software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary, I just want a clean install, with a single partition, that doesn't come with any pre-added software that I don't want.</p>
<p>I've found my OEM product key for Windows but because it's OEM and not retail Windows won't allow me to create a bootable USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrating, especially as I have a legitimate version of Windows 8.1 that I have paid for but don't seem to be able to re-install. I also don't want to use the Lenovo refresh option as that will just install the bloat-ware, and I've spoken to Lenovo
 and they don't provide any method for a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help hugely appreciated.</p>

            <p>Download a .ISO file of your Windows edition, download Rufus or Wintobootic (if its windows 8.1). Use WintoBootic to flash the .iso to a USB or sd card. You now have a recovery USB for your Windows 8 OS. In order to locate your serial key or Windows 8&nbsp;product
 key (located within the Windows Registry).&nbsp; There are several tools that do this but Belarc Advisor reportedly does this moderately well. Magic Jelly Bean Keyfinder works extremely too, but thats only my experience. Once you have the software key for Windows
 8 and any other proprietary software (Microsoft Office, etc). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;remember, this method is only legal if you own a LEGAL copy of Windows 8 and only intend to switch computers, components or hard drives. You cannot use the key on multiple computers at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you intend to get the software key to install Windows 8 on another machine then sell your old machine under the premise it has Windows 8, that would be illegal. Additionally, taking that old hard drive and selling it as a "registered Windows 8"
 hard drive would be illegal.</strong></p>

<h2>            Unblocking Windows Update</h2>
                    We are getting error 800072EFE when trying to connect to Windows Update on our workstations. We realize that this may be something to do with our firewall. So what are all the domains we have to add to our firewall as exceptions so Windows Update can do
 its work?<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Install onto a old computer with no OS</h2>
                    <p>For a while I have been trying to bring old life into a old hp PC to turn into a gaming PC. I have been having a issue installing windows 10. I select the boot device from a USB with the windows 10 set up [Same USB I used before on my personal PC so its
 works, I also put a fresh media creation tool on it.] After I save changes to the bios and attempt to load the media creation tool. It freezes on the windows 10 logo with a black background. The computer specs are above the requirements yet are old. The important
 specs are below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Intel core 2 Quad q6600</p>
<p>
</p><p>-4gb ddr2</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-360gb hdd [works I tested installing windows 10 onto on another PC after I had this issue, It worked fine then I wiped the drive and I am having this issue again.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option for safe boot in my bios so I can not try that. [As far as I looked there is no safe boot but I'm sure there isn't.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before it freezes at the Windows 10 Logo with a black background. So there is no error code to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To finish this up if anyone could help me or has had issues like this before please give me a hand.</p>
<p>

 any "fix' for this problem I noticed that it has been a problem with MANY foks over the years.&nbsp; Would like to get this cleared for me so I can get the updates as required.&nbsp; Just about each and every update that failed to install has a differnt error code.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best I can figure the error code&nbsp; 0x80070490&nbsp;&nbsp; is the main problem.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Jenni,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Run built-in Windows Store app troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>a. Click on Start search and&nbsp;type troubleshooting and choose 'Troubleshooting'</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>b. Click on 'View All'.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>c.&nbsp;Run the Windows Store apps troubleshooter.</span><span> (Right click on the built driver file.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>d. </span><span>Click/tap on
<strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong><span>. And check if it helps.</span></span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Clear the cache from Windows store</span></span></strong><span>
<span><br />
This command resets the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps. It’s a system and hidden file. WSReset.exe is usually located in the %SYSTEM% folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please follow the steps given below.<br />
<br />
a) Press "<strong><span>Windows</span></strong>+<strong><span>R</span></strong>" key on the keyboard to open Run window.<br />
b) In the <strong><span>Run </span></strong>window type "<strong><span>wsreset</span></strong>.<strong><span>exe</span></strong>"
 and then click ok it will clear all the cache in Windows store</span></span></p>

<h3> brandonmendoza  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t update xbox music app</h2>
                    <p>I down loaded all of the updates for the native apps, but the music app won't allow me too update it. Now, i can't even see the app on my start screen.
</p>
<p>When trying to update, the messages says the app failed to update and gives me the following code: 0x80073cf0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a brand new (32 gig) surface tablet, so this is frustrating. Music is so important for tablets/laptops/smartphones.

 4 TB western digital Black Caviar drive.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with these drives as when I test them there are Zero errors and zero bad clusters.</p>
<p>please tell me what I can do to open my files, they are still in the same place with the sam name and size etc it's just they won't open?</p>
<p>Chkdsk on both occasions started up after boot while I was taking a shower (I am freelance, home-based) by the time I realized on both times they were well into the recovery of thousands&nbsp;&amp; thousands of&nbsp;orphaned&nbsp;files. &nbsp;This is my work my disks are/were fine
 as were the files. CHKDSK has corrupted them period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what can I do to get them to be recognized again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hello Hugh :)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm terribly sorry for the situation. Let's see what we can do about this.<br />
<br />
I would first strongly recommend to start storing backups of your important data on a separate drive, preferably detached from your motherboard (external drive, NAS, Server, Cloud Storage, etc.) in order to be safe in such cases. I'd suggest backing up the
 rest of the data as soon as you can! If you need specific suggestions of ways of backing up data do feel free to ask!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could you specify the model numbers (NOT the serial numbers, this data shouldn't be posted publicly) of both drives? Have you run
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=zVfjqc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic</a> as see if the drives pass both the quick and the extended tests? This should give you an answer if the drives work properly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would also check the raw values of the S.M.A.R.T. status of the drive and see what they would tell. If you have troubles reading them feel free to post them here and we'll help you out.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All of this should tell you if the drive is the cause of the problem or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Morris asked some good questions and gave you some good info so I'd check that too!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Post back with some more info!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.<br />

            <p>Sorry for my lateness Morris but I didn't get any notification that I had replies.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>As for what happens when I try to open my files (either jpg or the CR2 file) for the jpg's the message varies depending on what I use to try&nbsp;to open them - (on a windows 7 x64 system)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Windows photo viewer states - 'Doesn't support file format.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photo Gallery states - 'unsupported, damaged or corrupted.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>photoshop stated - 'unknown or unsupported&nbsp;jpeg marker'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for the .CR2 file opening in photoshop stated - 'could not complete request as it's not the right type of document'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all the folder names and types are correct, as are all the file sizes correct and the dates and modified dates, what I did find out though was that when opening the files and using a hex editor and comparing them to healthy (working files) was that they
 seem to have all the information there but it was just scrambled up!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Yes I was using the default windows image viewers as well as professional third-party image viewers, including photoshop</li></ul>
<p>I will try to do a recovery to an earlier time but not sure this will help as the files were changed in checkdsk when it stated that it was recovering the orphaned files (still haven't found them or the .chk files)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the files were jumbled up (internally) by chkdsk&nbsp;and that all the file information is still there but just scrambled, but how do we get it unscrambled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, it was not the c: drive that was affected it was the n: drive a 4tb drive partitioned in two on the 1.7 tb&nbsp;(only 50gb) was corrupted. On the other 2 tb partition nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps and will not try the disc restore recovery until you state that it's safe to do so. (just in case by doing so it impeded my chances of a successful recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your experience time and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincere regards.</p>

                    Hello! Yesterday by this time, i had shut down my computer but it had restarted. After i logged in i was able to shut it down. But today I couldn't shut it down after more tries. I've read that it might me some sort of blue screen error but i don't get
 any. I also unchecked the box "automatically restart "in start up and recovery and i still don't get the blue screen. I also read that it might be something about hardware but i didn't do anything.&nbsp;How can i solve this problem?&nbsp;

<p>What exactly happens when you "try and shut it down"? And how do you go about shutting it down? Close the lid, hit the power button. click start&gt;shutdown? Try and be as specific as possible, like, "I click start&gt;shutdown, then the screen goes black but the
 computer stays powered up, even after leaving it for *minutes." Factual information about the exact situation is far more helpful then random thoughts on whatever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: See Vijays response. A copy/paste answer to an unknown problem. "there can be several causes" Right. To what though? Before going through all that "one size fits all" canned response, lets see if we cant find out what the actual problem is first.</p>

<h2>            Poor call quality</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>In Skype for Business admin center I can see that some users have a different location (see picture).</span></p>
<p><span>We have a few users in NL and some in the US, the US users are complaining that the have a poor call quality.</span></p>
<p><span>I see that some US users have the wrong location, does that mean that the connecting to a NL server instead of a US server?</span></p>
<p><span>And how can I change the location?</span></p>

<p>Hi SharronBA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you wanna get the poor call quality resolved. I'd like to clarify that the call quality issue has nothing to do with the connected server or location, it depends on the network connection/environment, audio and video devices, hardware drive updates
 and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the poor call quality issue in Skype for Business, you can refer to steps in the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2386655/you-experience-poor-audio-or-video-quality-in-skype-for-business-onlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2386655/you-experience-poor-audio-or-video-quality-in-skype-for-business-onlin</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the location query, the <strong>LOCATION</strong>&nbsp;info in Skype for Business center is based on the
<strong>Active users' Location</strong> in Office 365 admin portal. We can change it via&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/users</a>, then click the problematic
 user &gt; <strong>Product licenses</strong> and choose <strong>Edit</strong>. You will find that there is a
<strong>Location</strong> field above the license section. See the picture below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb64e19b-fae2-4c49-bf62-7bc424beca8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb64e19b-fae2-4c49-bf62-7bc424beca8d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change user's location via the steps above, but it doesn't affect the call quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

<h2>            Money in my account is missing&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my account has ran out of Gold membership. Its been about 2 months since. On the last day (October 29th), I checked how much money was in my account and at the time I had roughly 15 dollars or 1200msp. I checked again yesterday and I now have $6.51,
 but I dont know how. The last item I had bought was the Apocalypse DLC for Call of Duty Black ops 2. How can I lose money?! Especially points that have already been redeemed.&nbsp;My brother has an account but hasnt bought anything because he only has $1.50. Can
 someone help me? Ive had this account for almost 4 years and this is the first time this has happened. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
