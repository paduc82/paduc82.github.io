<p>I dont want to type Snip every time i want to use this and then add it.</p>
<p>It was showing on my Most Used List which made it easy to find, but then right after using it, it disappeared from Most Used. &nbsp;I dont think the Most Used list is working right. &nbsp;I know it ignores pinned apps ,but why did it show the Snip It App and then
 right after using Snip it , it disappeared from the list. &nbsp;It shouldve moved up the list , not off the list.</p>

            Thanks. I will try that tonight. &nbsp;I thought i had done that, but maybe i clicked the menu instead. &nbsp;The menu didnt have the option to pin to start. i shouldve tried right clicking. Rookie mistake i guess. Will close this out after i try tonight. &nbsp;Right
 now i am on a windows7 machine so i cant complete this.

            <p>Ok, this worked. I was right clicking from the actual tool and that is why i had no option to pin to taskbar.</p>
<p>Right clicking the tool doesnt provide any way to pin to taskbar.</p>
<p>Never knew you could right click on results from the search and pin them. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This app seems to act differently than the others. The others can be dropped to desktop and stay there. This is only on desktop while you use it.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes at random times, and often</h2>
                    Hello. My computer has been freezeing recently, at completely random times. It all happened it a week ago, when I was browsing the internet. The computer randomly froze. The computer completely locked up, so I had to hard reset it. Since that day, my computer
 has been freezing at random times. Sometimes it would be after a half hour, sometimes it wouldn't freeze for an entire day. One time the computer even blue screened, which means big trouble.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to do, as it's very annoying having to hard reset my computer. I think something inside my computer is breaking down, and I'm not sure what. The graphics card could be the biggest issue, because I know that it's old and crummy. The computer
 freezes when listening to music, playing games, watching Youtube videos, or even just surfing the web.
<br />
<br />
I've done a virus scan, and nothing was found. I've run the chkdsk, which did absolutely nothing. I set my bios settings back from ASUS-Optimal back to the normal, and that didn't help. Updating my graphics card driver managed to stop the freezing for a day.
 I'm all out of options here. I've checked the event viewer, and no discrepancies were found. I'd really appreciate the help.<br />

Actually - the damage the heat causes can be just as random (more so actually) than drive damage.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
With drive damage - you would need to access a given part of the damaged drive to cause the freeze - and that would be indicated (most of the time) by you doing some similar action or some similar action taking place in the background.&nbsp; Also - being Windows
 7 - there would be indications (most likely) over time in the event logs [could easily check the event logs for any failures detected.]&nbsp; Exceptions might be damage to the circuitry of the drive as opposed to the platters - but that damage would have either
 shown up early in the computers life OR been caused by some external force such as power surge or heat.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Heat damage (note the wording - not just over-heating) could happen anytime.&nbsp; It could be caused by slight overheating of some components over time and could be anything from bursting capacitors as the glue weakens on their tops to a CPU getting overheated
 as a background process the user doesn't even think about is occurring.&nbsp; The video card could also be the source - not an uncommon device to overheat and if its fan is also not working to par (and most people may have no sign of this other than the resultant
 freezes.)&nbsp; The power supply could even be the source - as it heats up slightly more than it should because of an assortment of issues it may not be able to supply the necessary power to the motherboard and the result may well look like freezing to the end-user.&nbsp;
 Even memory is not immune to the damage meticulous over-heating can cause.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Of course - drivers can be at fault - but it did not sound like that in this case (although I even suggested looking further into those in my last post) since the trouble was seemingly averted for a short period with a video card driver update.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Corruption in files can certainly cause this - and that COULD be attributed to all sorts of things (including hard drive issues) - and perhaps a SFC /SCANNOW could detect and repair such trouble.&nbsp; The OP is more than welcome to try this solution:

http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
However, having said all that, running a diagnostics on the drive is a good idea - make sure backups are completed before you do.&nbsp; Just get the drive manufacturer's diagnostics from their web page and run it - but do it carefully as some features found in these
 utilities can be damaging to your data.<br />

            I haven't checked for heat damage yet, but I have noticed something curious: there's a program I use, Steam, which is where most people download and buy games for PC. Without it open, the computer seems to be working fine. I've gone quite a few hours now
 without it open, and it hasn't froze once. The day before, it froze every hour. However, Steam is one of my most used programs, so I'd like to figure out if there is indeed a problem with that.
<br />

Still haven't checked for heat damage, but I will.<br />

New information - always good.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Uninstall Steam, restart the computer, run the cleanup steps I recommended and update the video card if that is not the one you already installed (and network device drivers too)... Then - after that - download and install the latest Steam client and restart
 - see if that helps.<br />

            Found another thing: I went through the event viewer, and there's an error that says, "driver atksgt.sys has been blocked from loading. That error usually happens when the computer crashes. Sometimes it doesn't happen at the freezing time, but most of
 the time it does. The driver appears to come from a program called Tages, which is a form of DRM (digital rights media) that are slapped on some games. It might be the problem, but I'm not sure yet. Also, I wasn't aware of ever having that installed, but I'll
 check. I'm gonna uninstall the program, and see what happens.<br />

<h2>            Why should I be using a Pin code to log in to my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    Not having a finger print scanner, I have still three ways to get onto my laptop: the good old, tried and tested 'password', 'face recognition' or using a 'Pin code'. Three ways, any one of which somebody can try to hack in with. For better security requiring
 two or even all three to get in is best. But W10 requires just any one of them. Searching for this question there are lots of answers how to manage the pin code. None that I can see explaining why I should have one in the first place. If I wish to choose between
 one or the other, how should I rank the three options in order of difficulty to hack?

<p>
</p><p>Password authentication is inherently insecure because the password is a shared secret. And, as everyone knows, a secret that is shared is no longer a secret.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Passwords can be given away, stolen or used for access to multiple external systems. Once the password is had, it can be used, by anyone, from anywhere in the world, for access to any external system you have access to. Username/Password combinations, when
 used as access credentials must be stored by the external systems being accessed. None of this is true concerning Public Key Authentication or certificate authentication, as provided in Windows 10.</p>

 edition of Windows 10 as part of the hardware certification program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, your corporate Active Directory or any other Certified Trusted Third Party Authority (see the FIDO Alliance) can and will certify the public keys and/or certificates generated by any Windows 10 device enrolled with them as world unique identifiers
 of the device that generated them. Again, you may want to delve deeper into this subject, it is beyond the scope of a simple forum and retyping of already provided documentation serves no good purpose.</p>

<h2>            How do I resolve a DirectX error involving GetDeviceRemovedReason&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing Battlefield 3 on Windows 7 (64-bit) for quite some time. A few weeks ago, I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro (64-bit) and experienced the below error four times over three weeks or so. I have been updating Windows and my NVIDIA driver when new
 updates are available.&nbsp; Windows UPdate has been pushing a lot of Windows Defender updates lately.&nbsp; Over the past few days, I have seen a huge increase in the frequency of this error occurring. I can no longer play through one game of Battlefield 3 without
 observing the error.&nbsp; It only seems to occur in this game, and only after upgrading to Windows&nbsp;8 Pro.<br />
<br />
I searched for and applied possible workarounds/solutions to this error, but nothing has proved conclusive.</p>
<p><br />
DirectX function "GetDeviceRemovedReason" failed with DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG: Device hung due to badly formed commands.. GPU: "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 590", Driver: 31090</p>

<p>Have you&nbsp;checked in their forums.&nbsp; Try contacting EA sports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; I did post in the Geforce.com and the Battlefield 3 forums for Technical Help on the Battlelog site.&nbsp; However, I did not contact EA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I no longer experience the error after selecting Google Chrome as my default browser. I'm not sure why, but at this point I'm not going to question it. Even when logged into Battlelog in Google Chrome, I still observed the error before. All I did was make
 it the default browser again and I'm fine. I've played three consecutive games in a row last night and three more tonight without issue. I couldn't make it through a single game without crashing before this change.&nbsp; It seems weird, but as long as it works
 I'm happy.</p>

    <title>Why cannot windows 8.1 open mdf files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why cannot windows 8.1 open mdf files&#63;</h2>
                    I just upgrade from win8 to win8.1. Every new feature is good, but I found that win8.1 does not support mdf files whereas wn8 file explorer can easily mount mdf. It is quite disappointing. I want to keep my PC neat and clean so I don't want to install
 so many assistant softwares in order to open many types of files. Can anyone tell me how to get the mdf support back in win8.1?

<h2>            Recovering Messages&#47;Call history after merging account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally created a separate Skype account for a job interview, but after merging Skype-only e-mail account with a Microsoft account, all contact info, message history and call logs seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to recover this? I did manage to find the old Microsoft Live ID tag associated with the e-mail-only Skype account if that helps in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lucas</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify,&nbsp;is the chat history you're trying to recover&nbsp;from&nbsp;your old Skype&nbsp;account or from the account you newly created? Also, is it the new account that got linked with your Microsoft account? Please provide those information so I can help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. <br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right, so I'm trying to recover chat history from my "old" Skype account which was only associated with an e-mail address (for interview purposes only), but after linking with another MS account that I'm guessing had other Skype history, chat logs and even
 contacts seems to have gone away from the "old" one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if I could recover old details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. To proceed, have you already tried to sign in to Skype using your old sign in credentials? I am referring to the credentials you used to log in before on your old Skype account. There is a possibility you are simply signed into
 a different account, that's why you are not seeing your contacts and chat history.</p>

<h2>            Asus vivobook x202e 11.6 touchscreen display does not work anymore</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I turn on my laptop, the display screen does not respond properly anymore. There screen is blank, with black lines going vertically and horizontally. Eventually, the entire screen fades into white. Overall, I don't think the screen doesn't work
 anymore. I've tried clicking on the mouse or pressing the enter key to see if the computer would respond, but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this laptop for about three years now and I hardly use the touchscreen until a few weeks ago. Does using the touchscreen have to do anything with the display not responding anymore?</p>

<p>Anyway, that's a bunch of B.S. (comment directed at Microsoft). This being a microsoft forum on microsoft.com, I hope people at MS read these. Should be able to change the download location. Due to the inability to TRIM RAIDed SSD's it's important not to
 load them up with junk like huge update files. Shouldn't be a new thing for a big company&nbsp; like MS to be aware of but I guess it is so hope others complain about this too.</p>

<p>I'm not questioning where the updates are installed, of course they have to be installed where the OS is installed. It's a matter of where the installation files are downloaded to by the update system. I can download an installation file onto any drive I
 want, be it local, network or whatever and then run it to install something on the OS drive. I can download the VS2008 SP1 update manually wherever I please, run it from there and update my installation of VS2008. Microsoft has the ability to change the update
 system so that I CAN CHOOSE where the update installation files are placed.</p>
<p>I appreciate the info but deleting them is not the issue. Writing over SSD cells over and over causes degredation, some temporary, some permanent. Constantly loading them up, whether you delete the files or they fall away on their own makes no difference.
 It still has a bearing on the performance of an SSD. With how large some software updates can be these days (a gig or more at times) is cause for wanting to put these files elsewhere. And since Intel has not seen fit yet to make TRIM available through the
 RAID hardware, it's a bit of a raw deal.</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware that the MVP's don't work for microsoft. My comment "This being a microsoft forum on microsoft.com, I hope people at MS read these" was as I said directed toward any possible MS people actually reading these forums. I'm sure they do occasionally.</p>
<p>I will consider your suggestion and possibly post a more performance related version of this topic on the performance forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, this forum doesn't work well in firefox (3.6 at least). The vertical blinking cursor bar often vanishes, so you have no idea where you're typing until you actually hit a key. This makes backspacing and using the arrow keys nearly impossible.
 I know this is a microsoft forum and they probably want and expect (incorrectly so) people to be using IE but it would be more considerate to at least test and fix this for other common browsers.</p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>

<p>J'ai récemment voulu essayer l'application xbox donner avec Windows 10, cependant, lorsque je fais "Activer" sur ma xbox one dans l'application, c'est long et ça me dit: "Nous ne pouvons pas démarrer votre console, assurez vous que cet appareil est sur le
 même réseau que votre console et que cette dernière est réglée sur démarrage instantané" alors j'ai regarder, puis j'ai vu que tout etait bien configuré mais ça me met encore ceci, le seul moyen pour que ça connecte, c'est que j'allume d'abord la xbox.</p>
<p>J'espère que vous pouvez m'aider, merci !</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Flash Cards and Function Keys not working after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite L675-S7113 running Windows 10.&nbsp; After updates last night neither the Flash Cards or Function Keys are working, so I can't adjust the brightness on my display.&nbsp; I know it was working before the updates because I've always had
 to adjust the brightness and have always used the Flash Cards.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; The display is too bright!

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Sheila.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to the Toshiba Support Downloads web page for your model to update the full set of drivers posted.  
<br />
<br />The Flash cards aren't really needed and are bloatware (unless you want them) but the hotkeys almost always have a driver posted, or it not try the latest chipset.  
<br />
<br />If you need any help post back the full model PC from the sticker on bottom.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Thank you.&nbsp; I went to the Toshiba website before posting here.&nbsp; I went to the support section, entered my complete model #, then a drop down list appears to select operating system.&nbsp; The problem is that Windows 10 doesn't come up as an option!&nbsp; How can
 I get a driver from their website then?&nbsp; By the way, I wouldn't mind doing away with the Flash Cards, even though I use them, IF the Function keys would work.&nbsp; The full model # from the bottom of the laptop is Satellite L675-S7113

            If there are no Windows 10 drivers, then check the Windows 8.1 drivers for your model number.<br /><br />Also look in the device manager access by right clicking the start button, for any devices that are in error and need to have a driver.

 it is Intel Graphics and used the link you gave, but I don't know which driver update to choose:</p>

            I know it's time for a new laptop but I just don't have the money right now.&nbsp; If I did I'd be throwing this one out the window lol.&nbsp; I didn't see any notices of any devices in error.&nbsp; I also went back to Toshiba support and tried Windows 8.1, but I'm not
 seeing anything regarding drivers for display, graphics, etc.&nbsp; Thank you for trying to help! &nbsp;

            Could they be in your Documents folder or your My Videos folder?<br />
<br />
If you know the format of the video files...&nbsp; .mov, .mpg, .avi&nbsp; for example...<br />
Do a search for that extension and maybe you will find the files.<br />

<p>Even when I do File/Exit or "X" the screen, when I come back, it no longer prompts me for an account/password.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand where you are comming from. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For you to be able to Sign out completely, you must need to manually click the Sign out&nbsp; button. You can find the Sign out button from your profile name (together with your profile picture)&nbsp;on the Home menu. Just click your name&nbsp;and you can find the
<strong>Sign out from Windows Live Mail.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, even you Sign out manually, File/Exit or click the X from the Live Mail Window, you will still be able to see the messages. This is because the emails downloaded from the web mail remains in the Windows Live Mail. This is the reason why you appeared
 to be permanently signed into the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't want this happening, you can remove your Microsoft account. Kindly visit this

<p>Easy. It took me a while bu5 i found the sign out option. Just click your icon profile button. The one that looks like a contact icon if you havent set a picture to it yet. Sign out pops up. Good luck. I cant believe they hide this stuff even in Gmail too.&nbsp;</p>

If the issue have stared recently, then I would suggest you to perform system restore to the date it was working fine.<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Press ‘Windows Key + r’<br />
b. In the run window type ‘rstrui.exe’ and click on OK<br />
c. Click on next in the System Restore windows<br />
d. Now choose the restore point of your choice, and try to restore your computer back to earlier state.<br />
<br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span>

<h2>            impossibile accedere col vecchio gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Salve provo a spiegare il mio problema anche se h<em>o i nervi a fior di pelle...ok partiamo</em></p>
<p><em>Non riesco ad accedere al mio primo gamertarg,con il quale ho voluto provare l'esperienza del live con l'offerta del mese gratis,mentre il secondo creato (non so perche) quando ho attivato il gold x 3 mesi mi va tranquillamente,peccato che non me ne
 faccio nulla visto che sta a zero di tutto.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Vorrei recuperare il primo profilo ma non ricordo la password e non mi fa accedere tramite l'email che fornisco,eppure nella casella ho ancora il codice a 4 cifre del</em><br />
Microsoft account.Si puo risalire alla pass tramite il gamertag e il codice o magari unire i 2 profili senza perdere i salvataggi del primo?</p>
<p>Vi ringrazio...help me</p>

<p>Grazie x la risposta.La cosa strana è che non riesco a farmi ridare la password,quando inserisco l'email dove ho le 4 cifre del codide account mi dice "L'account Microsoft non è corretto.Riprova"</p>
<p>Ho letto che non è possibile avere 2 account sulla stessa email ma sono sicuro di ricordare che l'indirizzo che roteava insieme al gamertag in alto a dx dello schermo è lo stesso che ho adesso.Non so che fare,io utilizzo solo 2 email,una mi porta a questo
 profilo e l'altra la rifiuta.Forse dipende dall'abbonamento gratuito?</p>
<p>Grazie in anticipo</p>

<p>Molto probabilmente, &nbsp;e dico molto ma molto probabilmente, tu eri collegato con &nbsp;due controller. Essendo la dashboard una sola ti mostrava l'account di un solo profilo, ovvero quello che era con l'avatar di Imback777IT. Mentre il secondo non era visibile
 fino a quando non sei tu a voler andare nella dashboard dell'altro profilo. Io direi &nbsp;che il tuo ricordo si basava su questa supposizione, sovrapposizione.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Come dicevi bene, non si hanno due gamertag collegato ad un unico account mail. Ma trovami anche un solo sito che ti permette ciò, se esiste è pura casualità, non dimenticare. :)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Per riavere il tuo profilo giocatore puoi fare la procedura password dimenticata. Ma devi per forza immettere la mail che corrisponde a quel profilo.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Se hai ancora il profilo sulla memoria, selezionalo e prova a compilare la parte dove ti chiede la password. Il primo passaggio ti mostra la mail. Ti basta questo e poi procedi dal pc per recuperare la password.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Non dipende dall'abbonamento gratuito, dipende soltanto da una tua dimenticanza. Gold o no è sempre un profilo giocatore, stai tranquillo che potrai recuperarlo.</p>
