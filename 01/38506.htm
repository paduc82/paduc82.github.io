<h2>            Windows 10 1809 update problem&#40;Windows could not configure one or more system components. to install windows restart the computer with error code 0xc1900101-0x30018&#41;</h2>
                    When the update was downloaded and prepared , it called me to restart the computer to install 1809 update . However, until 52%, it said that "Windows could not configure one or more system components. to install windows restart the computer." After it
 restore the system, i check out the update record and find that the error code is 0xc1900101-<span>0x30018</span>.
 What should i do?<br />
<br />
P.S. I have fix windows update errors by using the dism and system update readiness before.

<div>
<p>My solution:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I also had the problem with updating Windows 10 1803 (last version) to 1809 and the standstill at 52%, then rebooting and restoring the old version. I noticed in the logfile which I analyzed the part with "iissetup.exe" in connection with the abort. shift+f10
 for a console and possible repair with regedit during setup didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Therefore I proceeded like this:</div>
<div>
<p>In the software deinstallation (control panel) and with msicleaner (msicuu) i removed all old .net and visual studio parts. And then i reinstalled them with offline installer versions. there were still remains of old installations, but in the end they didn't
 solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Even with feature removal (control panel) and uncheck the box "internet information services" i couldn't get any further, because there were errors during deinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>***</p>
<p>The crunch point was the following:</p>
<div>I booted with ubuntu linux and renamed the folder "c:\windows\system32\inetsrv" (which also contains the "iissetup.exe") e.g. to "inetsrv.old". Additionally, under "c:\windows\winsxs" I moved all folders with the name mask "*windows-iis*.*" to another
 location.</div>
<div>Then i booted windows 10 again and restarted the update via the windows 10 update assistant.</div>
<div>Now it ran error free through the installation and the files/folders under "inetsrv" and "winsxs" were rebuilt with the current version.</div>
<div>
<p>***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my system is update correctly to the latest Windows 18 1809 build patch level. No further problems.<br />
</p>
<div>Hope this help, Ischte</div>

<p>Ischte - I could kiss you. Your suggestion worked for me! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than booting into Linux, I was able to rename the <strong>inetsrv </strong>
folder to <strong>inetsrv.old </strong>in Windows by:</p>
<p>1. Taking ownership of the folder</p>
<p>2. Stopping the <strong>Application Host Helper Service</strong></p>
<p>I then took ownership of the <strong>WinSxS</strong> folder in order to move the
<strong>*windows-iis*.*</strong> folders to a backup folder on another drive.</p>
<p>With these out of the way, I then used the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Update Assistant</a>
</strong>(rather than the ISO I had created), and updated successfully.</p>
<p>When the updater reached 52% - where it would normally create the error message - it instead went back to 46% for a moment, then jumped back to 54% and continued progressing from there. I'm guessing this is where it needed to rebuild the files I had removed.</p>
<p>Once the update was complete, I deleted the <strong>C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv.old</strong> folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is well, and I am successfully updated to 1809. Thanks again for your help!</p>

<h2>            Lanman server, IP Helper and IKE&#47;Auth IP problem</h2>
                    First off, a big sorry and a bigger thank you to 
Sathish S V who had replied to by previous question regarding svchost.exe problem. Had i not applied my "expert knowledge" of windows and instead took the advice of what someone who is more knowledgeable had suggested, this problem could have been over
 a long time ago (my only defense (shaky) is i thought he was asking me to start the system in "Safe Mode"..which i thought was the same as Clean Boot...and the lack of any solution in case i found the problem was running in Normal More and the suggestion of
 downloading the Safety Scanner frustrated me more coz i had already done that).<br />
<br />
Anyways, i had decided to reinstall my OS today and thought that i should give it one last go before finally taking that step. Downloaded a couple of hotfixes, downloaded software such as registry booster and PC health advisor, updated my system with the latest
 windows update, scanned my system once again with 3-4 different anti-viruses but once again without any success. Finally decided that i will run the system in safe mode and see what could be done. So i was very surprised to find that Clean Boot and Safe Mode
 were two different things...Identified the processes that were giving me the problem..one was a System Service (involving the shell hardware, server, background intelligence etc) and the other was a Network Service (telephony, cryptographic services etc) and
 a minor one was a Local Service (peer networking). Started with the System process and to cut a long story short, i isolated the problem to three services...Server, IP Helper and IKE and Auth IP Keying Modules. Now i have disabled those and there are no problems
 at the start and when i connect to the internet (the processes used to go crazy, taking up 100% CPU whenever i connected to the internet..i could have gone, boiled myself a cup of coffee and yet the problem wouldnt have settled down)<br />
<br />
My question is this...why did this happen? My system was going along nicely at least until the turn of the year...i checked my update history and my last update before the problem arose was
<span><em>KB958488 on Nov 11 2010.. Was there a problem with that update? My second question is...what should i do now...should i just disable the services and sit tight? Will there be any problems if i disable them (one thing i noticed was when
<span><em>KB958488 on Nov 11 2010.. Was there a problem with that update? My second question is...what should i do now...should i just disable the services and sit tight? Will there be any problems if i disable them (one thing i noticed was when
 i disabled them, my Firefox is hogging power...ie when i open a website, the CPU usage shoots to 90-95% but gets down quickly to 0 when the website is loaded) Are there any hotfixes for this problem?
<br />

<h2>            WD My Passport not recognized as External HDD on windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask if anyone experienced this and how the addressed the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a WD My Passport Ultra 1Tb and tested it on two devices (desktop at Win7 Ulti and laptop at Win7 Pro). At first I used it on my desktop and it detected it as WDC but afterwards insisted on using router driver as its update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I checked disk management and it is not there. </p>
<p>- I checked the device manager and it is detected as "Internet Access Server" (Might be the reason why a router driver was used).</p>
<p>- I tried to uninstall the&nbsp;"Internet Access Server" and restart the system to flush it out</p>
<p>- The desktop redetected the HDD as&nbsp;"Internet Access Server"</p>
<p>- I checked the BIOS and it is clearly detected as WD external HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of this i tried it on the laptop. No problems and did a reformat on the external HDD so that it can be detected as a fresh HDD by the desktop. Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Perry</p>

            <p>If by the 'incoming font' you mean the font used for messages you receive, then you may find that you have little control over it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In HTML messages, the font size will normally be specified by the sender in the HTML. You may find that you can&nbsp;change the size by using&nbsp;Ctrl-Scroll on your mouse, or (with an English keyboard layout) Ctrl + and Ctrl - . Ctrl-0 will revert to the default
 100% size.</li><li>You can specify the font size for reading plain text messages:<br />
When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options.<br />
On the <em>Read</em> tab, click <em>Fonts</em>. Specify fonts and font sizes for each encoding you're likely to come across. It will in most cases be enough to select options for
<em>Unicode</em>, <em>User defined </em>and <em>Western European</em>.</li><li>If you find that this is easier to read, you could on the same <em>Read</em> tab select
<em>Read all messages in plain text</em>. Then, to see a message in HTML, press Alt-Shift-H.</li><li>If you find that text is in general too small on your screen, it may be better to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
adjust the display parameters</a> to make text and other items bigger on the screen. You will then be able to adjust downwards in&nbsp;most programs where text size isn't a problem at the moment.</li></ul>

</p><p>You will note, of course, that the question referred to the font size for <em>
incoming</em> messages. The post you responded to refers to the font size for <em>
outgoing</em> messages (which is why the settings are on the <em>Compose</em> tab of program options).</p>

<h2>            Is there anyway to recover or fix an S HDD from the E68 error&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The E68 occurred to me yesterday when I was trying to log into my profile. At first, I thought my Xbox S was frozen or something since 5 minutes passed by and I was still logging in. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the ellipsis was still moving (the dot,
 dot, dot) and that my controller was not responding to any of the buttons. I also noticed there was a weird, strange clicking noise coming within my Xbox.</p>
<p>So I turned it off and restarted my console. The only difference this time is that I was now stuck on the Xbox starting screen and the clicking noise still persisted. A few seconds later, the E68 screen popped up, a red dot appeared, and I think the clicking
 noise is coming from the HDD itself, judging by the vibrations. The error will only pop up if I have my HDD inside, but without it, the Xbox works perfectly fine.</p>
<p><a href="http://oi68.tinypic.com/2vvlxkw.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2vvlxkw.jpg</a></p>
<p><a href="http://oi65.tinypic.com/2aaeefl.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2aaeefl.jpg</a></p>
<p>I also noticed there was a slight jagged, curved bit in the HDD. I'm not sure if that's normal or not.</p>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<p>Yes, my Xbox was working just fine a week ago</p>
<p>No, I usually don't take my HDD out very often and haven't done so in a while</p>
<p>No, the warranty for the HDD expired years ago</p>
<p>Is there some sort of way to crack open the HDD and fix it or at least recover the contents of it?</p>

<p>Reformatting the drive may fix the issue but if the drive is dying it will happen again.</p>
<p>As for the suggestion to get the transfer cable it is worth a try. &nbsp;But make sure that you're getting an official Xbox 360 transfer cable or it will not work properly and will make another official Xbox 360 drive act like a USB drive only</p>

<p>if you format the drive through storage on the transfer cable it will not make it compatible with the 360 internally. &nbsp;if you format it though the storage as an internal drive it would be compatible, but the ones i have only show up on the transfer cable,
 so that's not an option if it can't see it.&nbsp; as mentioned above, if it's dying then it's only a matter of time before it totally unusable, if it's not already.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not loading correctly. Apps not loading and not connecting to Internet</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title:</strong></em> Windows 10 not loading correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started to have a problem with Windows 10 starting up. When I turn on my computer, windows loads up and it seems to load correctly but when you try to open a program (app) it does not work. I does not even show the "timing"circle when you click to open
 a program. Also in some cases it does not even conect to the WIFI router. It is basically useless.</p>
<p>The only way to troubleshoot the problem is to turn off the computer which takes more than 2 minutes and then turn it back on. Usually the problem is fixed but if you let the computer rest (turned off) for a while the problem shows up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions in how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sergio.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with Apps not loading and not connecting to Internet. We will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the Proxy settings are on or If Windows firewall is blocking the apps to connect to Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Unfortunately, Modern UI apps including Windows Store will not work due to the proxy settings. You may have to disable and check with the issue. If disabling works, you may have to repeat this process in order to access the apps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to use the Modern UI apps as well as Windows Store without proxy settings. Follow the steps to disable the proxy connection:
<br />
<br />
a. Open<strong> Internet Explorer.</strong><br />
b. Click on <strong>tools</strong> and select <strong>Internet Options.</strong><br />
c. Click on <strong>Connections.</strong><br />
d. Click on <strong>LAN</strong> Settings.<br />
e. Remove <strong>check mark next to proxy server.</strong><br />
f. Click on <strong>OK.</strong><br />
g. Restart the <strong>browser.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Disable Firewall Temporarily and check if the same issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disable the Antivirus software temporarily and check if it helps.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 3: </strong>Run Windows Apps troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>

<div>Hi jimbospc,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may want to select the option (Since Safe Mode did not work) <strong>'Disable automatic restart on system failure'
</strong>from the below given link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Prevents Windows from automatically restarting if an error causes Windows&nbsp; to fail. Choose this option only if Windows&nbsp; is stuck in a loop where Windows fails, attempts to restart, and fails again repeatedly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</strong><br />

<div>Later, make sure your Windows Updates are upto date since most of the driver related issue is resolved when latest windows Updates are installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The text displayed for this error code differs depending on the type of device (legacy or Plug and Play).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If this device is a legacy (root detected) device, the following text will be displayed:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is either not present, not working properly, or does not have all the drivers installed. (Code 24)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have Windows detect whether this device is present or not, click Detect Hardware.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Run Hardware troubleshooter </strong>from the link and check what happens :
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If this is a Plug and Play device, the following text is displayed:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is either not present, not working properly, or does not have all the drivers installed. (Code 24)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try upgrading the device drivers for this device.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow the steps from the article given below:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. </strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the device still does not work, make sure the device is connected to your computer correctly. For example, make sure all cables are correctly installed, or that the adapter cards are properly seated in their slots.</div>
<div>
<div>There is no option to change IRQs in windows and there is no need for it since the inception of APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller ) and ACPI (Advanced configuration power interface) technologies.</div>

    <title>Windows Update freezes at 33&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickmoore13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update freezes at 33&#37;</h2>
                    Twice Windows has attempted to install the latest update and both times immediately after restart the update freezes at 33% for hours.&nbsp; Nothing will respond and the only thing I can do is power cycle the machine at which point it restores my previous version

            Hi Patrick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is the version Upgrade to Fall Creators Update Version 1709, What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If this is ordinary Windows Updates, then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.       
        </p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" do this multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<h2>            Howdo I to change permission on an external hard drive to get files&#63;</h2>
                    I put the hard drive from my old Windows XP computer in an external case to try and get files from it on a new computer. I can see the drive and file system in windows explorer but they all say permission not granted so cannot view. I am logged on as the
 administrator but cannot change the drive permission. I cannot copy the files to view either. How do I gain permision to view and change old files from this external hard drive? The Windows XP will not run on the old drive so this is why I am trying to save
 data. I have connected to a computer with Windows 7 and one with Windows XP and get the same warning on files. It does not work to look at file security tab and try to change. What do I try?

            Hi Kate,
<br />
<br />I'm not sure about dimming the screen but you can use Windows 10's built in feature called Night Light. Go to Start and type in Night Light and click on it. From there, you have settings on what temperature you should set it too as well as the timing.
<br />
<br />If you don't have it on your current feature update of Windows 10 and you don't want to update, no problem, you can get third party software like f.lux: <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://justgetflux.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other concerns.

<br />A side note, if you want to turn on Night Light without too many steps, hit Windows key + A to go into Action Center and click Night light. Hopefully it's in there.

            Hi<br />
<br />
<b>In xp yes, in windows 7 &amp; win 8 no.</b><br />
MS decided consumers only needed 1 output enabled per application and so that is what the subsystem is designed to do. You can specify different outputs for applications but not 2 outputs for the same application simultaneously. Even though the hardware is
 fully capable of doing it<br />
<br />
<p><span>Still you can try these options.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press Windows key + X.</span></p>
<p><span>•<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now click control panel</span></p>
<p><span>•<span>&nbsp; </span>Open Sound panel <br />
• Select Speakers as the default playback device <br />
• Go to the "Recording" tab <br />
• Right click and enable "Show Disabled Devices" <br />
• A recording device called "Wave Out Mix", "Mono Mix" or "Stereo Mix" (this was my case) should appear<br />
• Right click on the new device and click "Enable" <br />
• Right click on the new device and click "Set as Default Device" <br />
• Double click on the new device to open the Properties window <br />
• Go to the "Listen" tab <br />
• Click on the "Listen to this device" checkbox <br />
• Select your HDMI device from the "Playback through this device" list</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Connection to the network is taking longer than usual...&#34; but I can still use the internet&#63;</h2>
                    I've been connecting to the internet just fine, but I keep getting a message while connecting that my connection is taking a while to complete. During this time, I can surf the web, but it eventually finishes and tells me that the connection is limited.
 How do I fix this?
