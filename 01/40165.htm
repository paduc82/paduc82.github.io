<h2>            How long does Windows 10 trial last&#63; How many days do I have to try it before buying and activating&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7. I'm downloading the Windows 10 ISO with the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install Windows 10 and just try it a few days before buying it. If I like it and works for me I will buy it, if not, I will uninstall it and go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>I know my PC can run it because my PC is fairly new and I have a 64bit processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: how long does the Windows 10 trial last? How many days do I have to try it before buying and activating?</p>

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

<p><span><span><span>Hi, I am having issues with my desktop background and could really use some advice. For a couple of months now I have been unable
 to change my background picture through display properties/desktop/browse (I am using Windows XP Home), but although baffling (it was fine one day, not working the next) it was not really a problem as I could right-click in explorer and then select "Set as
 desktop background". Now, however, this option is missing! It is still there when I right click a picture on a website, but not in explorer! I really hope someone can help, it's such a minor problem and yet I can't figure it out at all! Thanks :)</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Class Action Lawsuit against MS BECAUSE... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamfnappi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Class Action Lawsuit against MS BECAUSE...</h2>
                    <p>True: we agreed to the terms of an agreement with MS regarding Win 10.&nbsp; HOWEVER:&nbsp; MS reported, in my case anyway, that WINDOWS 10 would run on my machine.&nbsp; They hounded me daily to upgrade.&nbsp; I finally caved in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've upgraded:&nbsp; I've had to manually install network drivers:&nbsp; been unable to work across my network: but WORST OF ALL: my PC crashes constantly now.&nbsp; I get the blue screen of death ALL the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be composing a Facebook post of some length for instance where your work isn't saved.&nbsp; Be 1/2 way through or better then zap.&nbsp; The Blue Screen of Death with the error message BAD_POOL_CALLER.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching this over &amp; over the most common cause of the problem is related to memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS Tech Support.&nbsp; The tech stopped reading the questions from my end at some point.&nbsp; Those people are maybe overworked?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; The girl told me she was helping other people at the same time as me.&nbsp; I'd asked because it kept coming up,
 "Sarah C. is typing"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would go on for a few minutes, then finally one line of text appeared on my screen and rarely did that line contain an answer to each corresponding previous question I asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was ridiculous.&nbsp; More wasted time and personally I'm sick of it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up: My PC keeps crashing and re-booting.&nbsp; I get the blue screen of death with the error message BAD_POOL_CALLER</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point?&nbsp; MS basically assured me that WINDOWS 10 would run on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the course of my lengthy waste of time with tech support, it was revealed that DELL did not test or develop drivers for my product.&nbsp; They decided to tell me that now.&nbsp; HOURS and HOURS of wasted time.&nbsp; HOURS.&nbsp; Work lost, and unrecoverable because my machine
 crashed due to a Win 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It bears worth repeating that MS gave me the go ahead to upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little help here, please.&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; 100% unacceptable.&nbsp; I want them to replace my PC that is the least they can do for the aggravation, the time, loss of productivity, being insulted by their tech support rep:&nbsp; At LEAST an hour of online
 chat and they want to presume they've been chatting with a moron.&nbsp; A complete moron?&nbsp; A clueless idiot.&nbsp; REALLY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to initiate a Class Action Lawsuit?&nbsp; I've got 100 that says I'm not alone in being or having been subjected to this horse sh^t and now I want compensation for the emotional distress if nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again: Anybody?</p>

            <p>MS is pushing Win10 <em>way</em> too hard. </p>
<p>- From the start they have seduced people into 'upgrading' machines that are only marginally suitable/compatible
</p>
<p>with Win10 due to lack of proper Win10 specific driver support. </p>
<br />
<p>And now people are getting caught out by an automated Win10 'upgrade' because they didn't get around to,</p>
<p>or never worked out how to tell MS to shove off with their Win10 freebie.</p>
<p>- I'm told that after 90 days from receiving the Windows up dates that deal with the promotion of the 'free'
</p>
<p>Win10 your machine gets 'updated' by default. An 'Our way or the highway' mentality.
</p>
<p>Preying on the unsuspecting non technical Windows customer base like this is shameful.</p>
<p>Of all the crass and callous corporate Bully Boy attitude from MS over the years this is one deserves
</p>
<p>a special applause.</p>

            <p>Thank you for venting your agreement of support of my concern.&nbsp; As you mentioned regarding the WIN 10 upgrade (to revert back to one's previous version, yes, all your info goes into protected sectors, it doesn't delete or overwrite that version until after
 90 days at which time, you older PC which if it was like mine that were running just fine, are now slightly better than garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem to switching to a Mac.&nbsp; Learning a new OS.&nbsp; Which now that i think of it, you basically have to do since WIN 8 if you've been with Windows since, in my case Windows 3.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem switching over.&nbsp; By one example, I have MS Office 2007.&nbsp; Do you see where I'm going with this already?&nbsp; I constructed a template for my credit cards in order to track each and every transaction I make.&nbsp; I have around 14 credit accounts...Do
 you see where I'm going with this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, in brief:&nbsp; I would have to start from a little better than scratch.&nbsp; Do you realize the magnitude of that task?&nbsp; It's so close to huge.&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; I REALLY have other things to tend to.&nbsp; This is not the only thing I have to do all day as I'm sure is the
 case with many, many people hence my wanting to get in or initiate a class action lawsuit against Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to end this message now before it is completely all for naught with a blue screen, a loud humming and the message BAD_POOL_CALLER&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>

            <p>In most cases: re: suing MS is a daunting task.&nbsp; I feel the public has a case though.&nbsp; For example, I bought a DELL VOSTRO 200 back in 2007 or so.&nbsp; It was running JUST FINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter the endless pop ups at the bottom right of our monitors about the FREE upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information on how, before long, Windows 7 and 8 would no longer be supported etc.&nbsp; Then the final blow.&nbsp; After not being able to rid yourself of that nuisance of a pop up, you cave in to the scare tactics...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You click the option to see if WIN 10 will run on your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You get the big thumbs up; all systems go they're just waiting for you to click ~"Download now."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the first PC I put it on, a DELL Inspiron purchased in early 2012 I believe, didn't load my network drivers.&nbsp; I did that manually.&nbsp; Fortunately I had the education to do so.&nbsp; I don't think most people can do that without contacting a tech support
 person personally. Either way.&nbsp; I get that mess cleaned up and connected to the internet, but my ability to print across the network that took some time to establish was no longer do-able.&nbsp; If I wanted to print I had to go to anothr room to use a PC I had
 to USB hardwire directly to the printer...so much for the convenience of the time I invested setting up that network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after tiring of those same messages on my VOSTRO 200 with the go ahead thatWIN 10 would run on it I downloaded it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since that day, I constantly crash from a BAD_POOL_CALLER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to download the latest update because I first have to free up 9GB of disc space.&nbsp; Maybe the fix is in there.&nbsp; I'll never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I contacted MS Tech Support.&nbsp; The girl I chatted with online did very little but further aggravate and infuriate me.&nbsp; An hour and a half to 2 hours of questions she didn't bother to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing she did do was get me to DELL's download page where it was then learned that DELL is not going to bother with driver updated for the VOSRTO 200.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't you think MS could have looked into this before telling me, for example, that it would be wise to NOT upgrade?&nbsp; I want compensation for my time, hours and hours and hours of time that could have been exerted instead toward productivity, not its opposite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want compensation for a lot of things as a result of the time I cannot get back: important posts that were never made because my PC crashed and ALL data was obliterated into nothing in electronic space...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm very busy with other things but this problem will remain.&nbsp; There's much more to be said about this and that's only from my own personal experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone doesn't beat me to it, which would be nice, I am going to seek out an attorney for help with this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to go now before I see a blue scree; a humming noise and the message BAD_POOL_CALLER :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens very VERY often.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.&nbsp; Don't be such a pessimst.&nbsp; Who knows, you may just be a member of this class if you've downloaded WINDOWS 10.&nbsp; More later most likely.</p>

            <p>Microsoft slammed me with Windows 10 today. I selected to turn notifications off for the free update offer then, all of a sudden my computer started doing Windows 10 UPDATES!!! I've been out of work for 2 hours so far... It's only on 16% now. Then if my
 hard drive survives this I'll loose the hours for the uninstall...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP DV6626 was built in 2006... Barely supports my Windows 7 student upgrade from XP... I have over $200,000 in student loans... I have aprox. $17,000 in CPA exam prep software (one registration) on this computer. I have been unemployed in STL for 5 years.
 I finally have a decent work from home job that gives me tasks on a first come basis. Irate is an understatement. I know I can and I will sue every member of the Board of Directors personally for knowingly allowing Microsoft to slam me! I'll start a new career
 lobbying against this MONOPOLY!&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this is a laptop (particularly, but not necessarily, Dell), it may be related to a bad battery.&nbsp; Read<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/49975-35-typing-keyboard-slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this thread</a> all the way through -- there are a few posts that suggest that
 the root of the problem is a video card driver that is looking for hot keys being pressed.</p>
<p>If it's not a laptop, or if removing the battery doesn't help, the problem may be caused by some application (e.g., malware) consuming most of the computer's resources.&nbsp; Open Task Manager and take a look while typing to determine what is using the most CPU
 cycles.</p>
<p>If you haven't recently checked for malware, download, install, update and run both of these free programs (don't run them at the same time; run each when you have something time consuming to do away from the computer -- doing a full scan of a large hard
 drive can take quite a long time):</p>

<p>Resorting to a complete reinstall of Windows as the first option ("to save your time") is typically the response of "techs" at BigComputerStore or GeekSquad types of outfits.&nbsp; It's also usually the wrong first step, particularly if a user has many applications
 installed (all of which will need to be reinstalled using their original install media and authorization codes).</p>
<p>Number (5) is simply bad advice and should not be followed in any event.</p>
<p>Number (6), on the other hand, is excellent advice and should be followed in all cases.</p>

<p>Sorry Pete999, installing a free firewall is still a better choice than standard Windows firewall. Since I am unaware of the present situation for question by CSOG, my suggestion is to install free firewall is most recommended to prevent malware installation.
 Of course, many people avoid firewall from Symantec/Norton and alikes&nbsp;either due to annual price between 9.99 to 79.99 for internet security suite.</p>
<p>I do not work for any of the outfits you have mentioned.</p>
<p>Finally, having reinstalled WinNT, Xp, Vista for over hundred of times in order to solve seemingly simple issue, I can say that either the problem re-menifests as other system\program problems or not solving the problem. I am not saying that simple registry
 tweak or other methods&nbsp; which could restore funtionality without wasting time should not be tried first. But, since the lack of user supplied information, partly due to lack of experience in troubleshooting due to age (too young, too old), or simply technically
 incompetancy, all I am making user aware of time input.</p>
<p>As you know, I would have suggested run Autoruns and then fix several of the explorer hookups or disable startup runs and isable services, you get bog down to dirth of information and plethora of incompetancies.</p>
<p>Of course, actual scenario might require more user input than simple incoherant and nebulous questioning which is more frequent than summer dog days.</p>
<p>No offence to you, but I stay to focus in getting problems solved -- the easy way.</p>

                    <p>I&nbsp;have been stuck in the "Avoid Me"&nbsp;Reputation for about a month now. I have had this xbox live account for 8+ years and have never been reported more than I&nbsp;have while playing Overwatch. I&nbsp;received over 20+ reports in the month of November, there is no way to dispute or file a case review, most of them are for Voice Communication, Or Unsporting Behavior, but I&nbsp;also received a handful of reports for "Cheating".&nbsp;Cheating because I am better at the game than most players, &amp;&nbsp;How can I&nbsp;have bad voice communication when 99%&nbsp;of the time I am playing with a team of friends in private chat... Regardless,&nbsp;I have been doing everything as directed by xbox live customer support as well as multiple forums/posts from other people who have been unfortunate enough to be dropped into the avoid me rep. On the XBOX&nbsp;LIVE&nbsp;Enforcement page, it shows my reputation level going from green in&nbsp;October (Good Player), to Red in November&nbsp;(Avoi

    <title>Intermittent internet outage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennynd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent internet outage</h2>
                    I hope this is the correct forum for this question. If not please advise.<br />
Over the last several months I've been experiencing intermittent internet outages.(usually on several days during the week-some days not at all)&nbsp;Sometimes these will last a few seconds. Sometimes it will be be several minutes. Sometimes the connection will
 be re-established by itself. Most other times I will right click the network logo in the system tray and diagnose and repair. The diagnoses may vary-usually I will reset the lan connection. Most of the time the repair will be successful. Sometimes I unplug
 the power on the modem and this has usually worked. I also have perfromed a test on the network card during an outage and gotten the result that there there is a problem with the tcp/ip connection.( with error message-discussed with HP)&nbsp;Of course the test
 passes when taken when things are ok.<br />
Solution history-Have talked to Comcast-they didn't find a problem. Have spoken several times to HP. They reset IE7 and performed tests and found nothing. I&nbsp;'ve since replaced&nbsp;my modem and the problems reoccured.<br />
Speaking again to HP in the past week they performed more tests such as pinging from the command prompt. The conclusion reached by the techie was that the network card was defective and since it is part of the motherboard, the mb had to be replaced.(under warranty).
 A call to schedule an in-home repair was scheduled. When I didn't receive that call,&nbsp;I called back. Another advisor now thinks it is a software problem rather than hardware. They are still going to replace the motherboard and if that doesn't work they recommend
 a re-format which I really don't want to do.<br />
What are your thoughts on this problem? Is it a&nbsp;hardware or a software problem? Possible solutions?<br />
I have an 18-month old HP media PC and run V. Home premium.<br />
Thanks Kenny

            Hello Kennynd,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;With the issue described that you are experiencing you started off with the first place I would recommend and that would be your ISP. (Comcast)&nbsp; They would first verify if there are any outages in your area.&nbsp; Also troubleshooting with IE7 was a good troubleshooting
 technique.<br />
<br />
The Network Diagnostics tool that is part of Windows Vista is designed to test the network connection for errors. The Network Diagnostics tool can also be used to determine whether network-related programs are working correctly. To use this tool to troubleshoot
 network connectivity problems, follow these steps: 
<ol>
<li>Open Internet Explorer, and try to access the Web page that causes network connectivity problems.
</li><li>On the page that displays an Internet Explorer error message, click the
<strong>Diagnose Connection Problems link.</strong></li></ol>
The Network Diagnostics tool will run. When the tool has finished running, it will report one of the following results:
<ul>
<li>It was unable to find a problem. </li><li>It has detected a problem. Additionally, the tool will provide guidance on the next steps to take to troubleshoot the problem.</li></ul>
<p>Below I have attached a link that gives other troubleshooting for this problem.&nbsp; If this has helped or resolved the problem&nbsp;please let me know.<br />

            Reporting to field that I did get Windows 8 64 Bit to warm up to my old ATI TV capture card.
<div>For anyone who has same difficulty, the solution, finally, was, from refreshed install, to install the video card driver first as per the latest that was available for W7 64. &nbsp;Then restart and use the driver update pointing to the folder where the W7 64
 diver was located. &nbsp;Windows found what was required and got it installed and I am again enjoying my media center&nbsp;experience&nbsp;including TV tuner on W8.&nbsp;</div>

            Hopefully it is not too late to comment here; I have an ATI 650 tv tuner, only Windows 8 x64 will not pick it up. It worked on Windows 7, does anyone know a solution?

Whatever version was around in 2006: In that case, I think it is an old one. Also, isn't one of the tuners a portable USB tuner; in that case, I have the internal, non-USB card.

            I just built a new HTPC, dual tuner.&nbsp; One card is the TV Wonder&nbsp;650 PCI&nbsp;and the other is the&nbsp;TV Wonder 600 PCIe.&nbsp; It definitely works.&nbsp; I added the TV Wonder 600 after the build and WMC recognized it automatically.&nbsp; The driver mentioned above works for
 both cards. &nbsp; It's windows 8.1 with WMC based.

<h2>            Upgrade Vista -- &#62; Windows 7. Cannot Unistall Intel Proset wireless WiFi Software</h2>
                    Computer: Toshiba Laptop Satellite A305<br />
<br />
I have the Upgrade Disk for Windows Vista, to upgrade to Windows 7. During installation, the message appears that Windows 7 cannot complete the installment, and I need to Uninstall the Intel Proset wireless WiFi Software.
<br />
<br />
I am using the Uninstall Programs utility from the Control Panel. When I highlight "Intel Proset wireless WiFi Software", there is no option to Uninstall the program. I tried using the Repair function, but the Windows 7 upgrade hangs at this juncture, insisting
 that I uninstall&nbsp; the&nbsp; Intel Proset wireless WiFi Software. I am therefore, stuck. Thank you for your suggestions. It is late here now. I will check back tomorrow.

            Update: Problem solved by a local computer whiz. He logged onto Intel, and following that visit, was able to uninstall the Intel Proset Wireless Software. Then the Windows 7 Upgrade finished installing, and is fine. The<i> new
</i>wireless software program was contained within Windows 7. That is why Windows 7 wanted the Intel program removed.

<p><span>Hi TykaW,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is possible that the Windows Live folder is corrupted that's why you are experiencing this issue. We recommend you reinstall Windows Live Essentials by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this, kindly follow the steps below:</p></span>
<p><span>1. Restart your computer.<br />
<br />
2. Optimize your Internet Explorer browser. We need to reset the settings to make sure the browser is working correctly. Follow this link:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/optimize-internet-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer browser
</span></a><span><br />
<br />
3. Disable your third-party security software. You may restore the service after&nbsp;installing Windows Live. Please also make sure Windows Firewall is enabled. It is necessary to have this up to avoid any errors.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Uninstall Windows Live.
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to uninstall Windows Live Essentials</span></a><span>.
 In case Windows Live Essential is not found on the<strong><span> Add or Remove</span></strong>
<strong><span>Programs</span></strong>, proceed to the next step.<br />
<br />
5. Delete the old Windows Live folder.<br />
5.1 Go to <strong><span>C:\Program Files</span></strong> (in case you are using a 64-bit Windows OS, go to (<strong><span>C:\Program Files(x86)
</span></strong>instead) and delete "Windows Live" folder.<br />
5.2 Go to <strong><span>C:\Program Files\Common Files</span></strong> (<strong><span>C:\Program Files(x86)\Common Files
</span></strong>for 64-bit Windows OS) and delete "Windows Live" folder.<br />
<br />
6. Install Windows Live by downloading the full installer first. Follow this link:</span></p>

            <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a "Bad Image" issue with WMASF.dll. I followed the suggested steps, as it seemed like the problem had the same source, but it was not resolved, I still recieve the below error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32\WMASF.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administratir or the software vendor for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error pops up when I try to run FFXIV.exe (Final Fantasy game). Replacing the individual .dll did not work either (I put the original WMASF.dll back after the new one didn't work). I have checked issues with the game community, which suggested that
 the problem was external to the game, but have been unable to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to see touch screen driver listed in Device Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I suspect that the problem might be with the&nbsp;incompatible&nbsp;touch screen drivers. Suggest you to check and install the latest compatible touch screen drivers for your device from Manufacturer website. You can search them using device
 Model number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're able to see the touch screen driver listed in Device Manager, then try the below mentioned troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Open run command by pressing
<strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> (without quotes) and hit Enter.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c). Right click on the driver and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>. When it prompts to choose an option
<strong>How do you want to search driver, </strong>then go with <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.
</strong>If you have a driver available on your PC, then select <strong>Browse my computer for driver software,
</strong>then select the appropriate location, where the driver located on your PC for updating it. (<strong>Ensure that PC is connected to Internet while performing this step</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same
 driver and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> then restart the system and let the system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong>Recommended step</strong>)</span></p>

<h2>            Mouse right click to drag and drop or rename folders and files is not working</h2>
                    
<p>For a couple of weeks now, I've had trouble with the right click feature to drag and drop folders and files, or to rename folders and files. This happens when I use windows explorer or access the computer and click thruogh to a feature. It does not happen
 to all folders and files, but many. I cannot right click on these folders or files to change sharing because explorer closes down and reboots to the desktop constantly with a right click. The error shows 'appcrash' as the reason. I have Norton Security suite
 installed and neither Norton or your fix program finds a problem.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>Have you installed or deleted/uninstalled any hardware or software or drivers since just before this problem began (if so, exactly what - name,&nbsp;version, device,
 whatever)?&nbsp; Has Norton caught any infections even if it says it cleaned them up since just before the problem began?&nbsp; If so, do you know the names of these infections?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; It's been a while so I'm not sure you have an old enough restore point but it is possible - I hope so.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Are these files and folders in your user profile?&nbsp; If so, your user profile may have become corrupt (in fact, if may still be corrupt
 if the folders aren't located there).&nbsp; <span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Let's check some
 of your system files and hard disk for ccorruption which may be causing this:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go
 to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please
 checkwith the manufacturer to see if there is an updated mouse driver (or software or firmware) available for your make and model of mouse and your version of Vista.&nbsp; Download and install it to update the driver to the most current available and see if that
 resolves the drag and drop problem (though I know it won't affect the renaming issue).&nbsp;
<span>
Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If
 that doesn't work (or if SFC finds corruption it cannot repair), we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Are you using a DSL connection or a Dial-up connection?<br />
What is the exact error message?<br />
Was the installation completed successfully?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Internet connection problems are most commonly caused by disconnected cables or by routers or modems that are not operating properly. First, try these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.If you haven't already done so, run the Network troubleshooter to see if it can help diagnose and solve your problem.<br />
Open the Network troubleshooter by right-clicking the network icon in the notification area, and then clicking Troubleshoot problems.
<br />
2.Make sure that all cables are connected (for example, make sure your modem is connected to a working phone jack or cable connection, either directly or through a router).<br />
3.Restart your modem, and then restart your router. Remove the power cable from the modem and router. After all lights on the device have gone out, wait at least 10 seconds, and then plug the modem and router back in. Some modems have a battery backup that
 prevents the lights from going out. For this type of modem, press and quickly release the Reset button.<br />
4.Check your router. Because of the new networking features in Windows Vista and Windows 7, some older network routers are not fully compatible with these versions of Windows and can cause problems. You can test your router to see whether it is fully compatible
 with Windows 7 by running the Internet Connectivity Evaluation Tool. Or, for a list of routers that are compatible with Windows Vista, go to the Windows Compatibility Center website.<br />

<p>yes,i'm using DSL connection.and i&nbsp;had to&nbsp;going throught the user guide before it's can&nbsp;start for the installation.at the last part of the guide,it's has a test drive to see whether is compatible. . and the result shown up no net work connection is found.so
 the installation can't be complete.so i follow the guide.&nbsp;i went in to control panel=network connection to change the adapter setting.&nbsp;and only mobile connection modem and wireless network connection,i can't&nbsp;find the modem that i want to connect to.&nbsp;so does

            Hi BrookeJ,
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 has issues or is not working as expected, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<br />
<br />When you download the .ISO file, you can start the upgrade by simply double clicking the .ISO file to mount it.
<br />
<br />You can download the latest .ISO file available for Windows 10 from this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hi Brooke.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Try reinstalling all of the Store apps from the Command Prompt from Option One here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. 
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC. 
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt. 
<br />2. Select Run as Administrator. 
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow without quotes and hit Enter. 
<br />Now check for the issue. 
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool. 
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files. 
<br />
<br />1. Click on 'Start'. 
<br />2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box. 
<br />3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command: 
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth 
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth 
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />Method 3: 
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator: 
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device. 
<br />
<br />If issue persist: 
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these steps: 
<br />1.Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator 
<br />Method 1: 
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R on your keyboard 
<br />2. Key in PowerShell and hit Enter. 
<br />3. Right click on the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select Run as Administrator. 
<br />
<br />Method 2: 
<br />1. Right click Start button 
<br />2. Choose Command prompt (Admin) 
<br />3. Key in Powershell in the black window and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />2. Paste the following command in the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window and press Enter key: 
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />3. Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up. 
<br />4. When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully itll start working. If not, this solution wont apply to you, unfortunately. 
<br />
<br />Are you able to solve it for you by following the procedure mentioned above or it fails? If it it fails, do make sure that you ran Powershell as Administrator (window will be called Administrator: Windows PowerShell ) and gave the command enough time to execute. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you. 
<br />
<br />Angel.

    <title>Windows Live Music Maker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Music Maker</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently downloaded and installed Windows Live Movie Maker. I searched&nbsp;for Windows Live 2012 on the Microsoft site and was directed to the
</p>
<p>following page:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</a></p>
<p>The Windows Live Installer installed version 15.4.3555.308. From what I can glean from the forums this is the latest version, and using Windows Update did not present any newer updates. However, Movie Maker does not have the option of adding narration as
 well as audio. On a recent Microsoft community forum someone asked how to add narration in Windows Live Music Maker. Two replies by moderators on February 5th and 6th 2012 stated that "the narration feature is not available in Windows Live Movie Maker". However,
 another reply 6 months later (3 months ago) by another moderator stated that "the feature you're inquiring is now available in the new Windows Movie Maker 2012 ... From the Home tab click on record narration". He also provides a link to "What's new in movie
 maker 2012?" where another moderator lists the new features of MM 2012 and explains: "Movie Maker now allows you to record narration ... Narration can be recorded by clicking on the Record Narration button in the Home tab".</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/narration/accb482c-4e14-4964-8a95-45306d018e99">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/narration/accb482c-4e14-4964-8a95-45306d018e99</a></p>
<p>I find this very confusing. My question is: Where can I download the version of Movie Maker that has the Record Narration button in the Home Tab? There are videos on YouTube that demonstrate the feature, allowing video, audio and narration on the one timeline.
</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>

            <p>The first question is what version of Windows are you running?&nbsp; The answer I give depends on the version of Windows you are running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short answer is, the narration feature was added in Movie Maker 2012 (16.4.3505.0912) which is part of Windows Essentials 2012.&nbsp; Movie Maker 2012 can be installed on Windows 7 and Windows 8.&nbsp; While Microsoft previously included "Live" in their branding
 of consumer apps, they dropped that in 2012, so what used to be Windows Live Movie Maker is just known as Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are on Windows Vista, however, Microsoft has <u>not</u> made Movie Maker 2012 available.&nbsp; It requires Windows 7 or later, as I said before.&nbsp; So if you are on Vista, the latest version you will see is Windows Live Movie Maker 2011 (15.4.3555.0308).&nbsp;
 I suspect this might be your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All is not lost, however.&nbsp; You can add your own voice to your movie by using the Sound Recorder application.&nbsp; Record what you want to say and then add it as your "music" in your project.&nbsp; If you need to have both music and narration, then you can do that
 in two passes.&nbsp; For example, in the first pass, make all your video edits and add your first layer of sound (say the song).&nbsp; Save your project (File &gt; Save project) and also save the movie (File &gt; Save movie).&nbsp; Now start a new project and add the movie created
 in the first pass.&nbsp; This time when you add "music" use the next layer of sound (e.g. the narration).&nbsp; Again save your project and movie.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the other computer isn't connected to the internet, you can download the offline installer for Windows Essentials here:</p>
