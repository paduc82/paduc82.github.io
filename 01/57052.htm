<h2>            Security codes are not working when trying to login to my account.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to login to my account but it says I need to use a security code, I put in the last digits og my number, I get the code but it doesn't work when I type it in. I've tried 3 or 4 different codes, I tried sending it to my email but it's still saying
 it isn't correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried the "through an app" version, but it says I need my code from two step verification.... I cannot find the Microsoft account app anywhere, so I dunno how to do that. I turned 2 step verification off as that makes no sense what so ever, like where
 does that code come through? There is no Microsoft account app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now through an app just brings up this random characters and a spinning wheel and says it's waiting, but where do I go now? I tried that authentication app but it needs a security code thing to login, but that's being rejected as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm lost to why they're not working when I've tried to my email and my phone, I'm typing the codes in correctly, how can they ben wrong if they're sent from Microsoft?</p>

            <p>I'm experiencing a similar issue.&nbsp; I need to reset my password but can't actually receive the code via SMS, which, unfortunately, is the ONLY way one can verify their identity if 2-step verification is enabled.&nbsp; 1st by email but then also need to verify
 identity via text.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is a Microsoft issue or a Wireless provider issue.&nbsp; I know PayPal had a similar issue a few years back with Virgin Mobile and once VM upgraded their OS, the SMS messages were allowed through.&nbsp; Looks like MS in this
 case however, since SMS was working yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also appears that MS will no longer allow the use of the Google Authenticator application in favor of their own MS Authenticator application.&nbsp; Go Figure.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 computer doesn&#39;t go into sleep mode, but seems to power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lovesredsquirrels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 computer doesn&#39;t go into sleep mode, but seems to power off after sitting idle a few minutes.</h2>
                    A few days ago a message from Dell popped up on my Dell Inspiron 3147 to update the BIOS. It was the 2nd time I had seen said message. The first time I was in the middle of something and didn't want to take the time to do it.&nbsp; When the message popped up
 the other day I decided I could take the time to do the update. Since then, my computer doesn't go into sleep mode, but seems to power off, to which I have to sign on every time I want to use the computer, even if it's been idle for 15 minutes.&nbsp; This has never
 been a problem before and despite checking the power/sleep options, I cannot seem to get it to go back the way it was before the update. It is aggravating to have to sign on and wait for the computer to boot up every time I want to use it. Can someone please
 help? Thank you!

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I realize the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span><span> </span>You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer
 waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + X.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Control Panel.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>on the left pane, click on <strong>View All.</strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Power to run the troubleshooter.</strong><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span><span><span>If the above method doesn’t help, I suggest you to
<strong>reset and restore all </strong>of the default Power Plans back to their default settings. Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + X.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;At the <strong>command prompt</strong>, type <strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type <strong>exit </strong>to exit the Command Prompt window.<br />
5.&nbsp;<strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check with the issue.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3: </strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Clean boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot:<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></span></a>
<span>Note: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 4: </strong></span><span><span>I suggest you to update the BIOS, graphics driver and chipset drivers for your computer model from the manufacturer website and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
 the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;

            Thank you for your response. I had already tried Method 1 &amp; 2 beforehand. Neither of them worked. The BIOS update was installed last week, which is when I started having this problem. I can go to the manufacturer's website to see about the chipset &amp; graphics
 driver updates.&nbsp; I can also try Method 3 to see if that helps. I'll let you know. (My daughter told me her computer (Windows 10) is doing the same exact thing. When she&nbsp;asked tech support about it, she was told it's a Windows 10 thing and there's nothing that
 can be done about it.) &nbsp;Thanks again!

            Regarding Method&nbsp;4, I followed your advice and went to the manufacturer's website to check for driver updates. A chipset driver update was available so I proceeded to install it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did&nbsp;not help. In fact, last night an error message came up "Faulty hardware
 corrupted page" and the screen went blue.&nbsp; I have not tried the Clean Boot option yet. I am getting a little&nbsp;anxious about doing anything that would mess up my laptop more than it already is. Why in the world the laptop keeps powering off and I have to sign
 on multiple times a day, I do not know. Everything worked great until last week. It is so annoying!

And what e-mail program are you using?</p>
<p>May I point out that you are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hijacking a very old thread. </li><li>Being very demanding of people that for the most part are volunteers and not employees of MS.</li></ol>
<p>If you are in a real hurry, contact Microsoft Support. Just be sure to have your credit card handy. I believe the current charge is $59.00 per incident.</p>

<p>
</p><p>User needs to add the following two lines to the XML file on the server located at -<br />

</p>
<p><br />
&lt;OS Architecture="9" RequiredProductType="1" RequiredSuite="" ExcludedSuite="512" SPMinor="" SPMajor="" Build="10240" Minor="0" Major="10" Name="Windows 10, AMD64" id="9"/&gt;<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have added these 2 lines to the 5 SBS2011 Standard servers I support with no issues,&nbsp;but haven't yet&nbsp;joined a W10 machine. I think this may fix the issue of using the server to join the client.</p>

<p>Now I see there was some issues last night while I was a slumbering but it seems whatever they have done has bought about this new issue being 0x87af010a. I've searched for this error code and no one seems to know what it is and I can't use my Xbox until
 it is sorted.&nbsp;</p>

            Maybe reset your router, unplug your console after hard reseting that as well, plug your console back in and turn it on, see if it lets you at least log in to your profile offline then try to get back online. If you are able to access your profile, try
 logging out of it and logging back in.

<p>Im sorry oldboy swift but it feels like I'm getting the IT crowd treatment here of turning things off and on. Now please understand that things like this are what I first check, I do my hard resets and removing the power after it and checking net connection
 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of thing has happened before where they try to fix a broken app and it messes up other users.&nbsp;</p>

            Are you able to do anything at all on the console or does the error message block you from accessing the settings menu etc? Troubleshooting is limited if you can access anything on the console and your posts makes it sound like the error pops up when you
 switch on the console and blocks you from the menus. Is this accurate?

<p>I think a console reset is needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Press and hold the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>BIND&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>button (located below the Xbox button on the console) and the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>EJECT&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>button
 (located on the front of the console), and then press the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Xbox&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>button on the console.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Continue holding the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>BIND&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>EJECT&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>buttons
 for 10-15 seconds.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>BIND&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>EJECT&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>buttons
 after the second power-up tone.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select Reset this Xbox</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select Reset this Xbox and Keep Games and Apps</span></span></p>

                    I am not able to update the drivers for any device!! When I try, I get message saying that the best driver for that devise is already installed!!<br />
I know that is not right because the driver for my DVD is a generic CD ROM driver that has a transfer rate at -1.00. I cant figure out how that driver got installed and what happened to the correct driver?<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like, you need help in updating the drivers of the computer. I need some information before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? <br />
2. What is the exact issue that you are facing? <br />
3. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? <br />
4. Which is the operating system installed on the computer? <br />
</p>
<p>Windows find the drivers for your drivers through Windows update. Have you set Windows to check for recommended updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not refer this article to get more information. </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to downoad the drivers, you may have to download the drivers from the Manufacturer website.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information helps. Do get back to us if you have more queries regarding Windows.

<p><span><span>Hello lookingforsoloutions,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you simply delete the partition, Vista would not boot up. Once you delete the partition, you will either need to do a Startup Repair or recreate
 bootrec. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer the below article that will give you information on ‘How to do a Startup repair’:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>You can also type the following command from the command prompt from the recovery console.<br />
<br />
a. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the DVD drive, and then restart your computer from the DVD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> when you receive the prompt Press any Key to boot from the
 CD or DVD, press any key on the keyboard to restart your computer by using the Windows Vista DVD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 your language setting, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 Repair your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 the Windows Vista installation to be repaired, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under
 System Recovery Options, select Command prompt, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the command prompt type:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>bootsect /nt60 SYS /mbr</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also if you reinstall Windows then as long as you use the retail product key you can install it with any retail vista DVD.</span></span></p>

<p>In addition to Irfan's suggestion you may want to try the following. This was originally written for Windows 7 as you can see but it amy also work on Vista since they boot depend on a BCD store and valid Master Boot Record. If Grub is involved you may find
 there is a slight variation in the results for each step.</p>
<p>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7:</p>
<p>a) Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.</p>
<p>b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.</p>
<p>Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the display.</p>
<p>c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”</p>
<p>d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.</p>
<p>e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.</p>
<p>Note: On a Dual Boot system there may be only one operating system listed if you have removed one of the two versions of Windows 7. Click the ‘Next’ button.</p>
<p>f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.</p>
<p>g) At the DOS prompt type the following three commands:</p>
<p>bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr</p>
<p>bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)</p>
<p>bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd</p>
<p>h) Close the command prompt window and click the ‘Startup Repair’ option.</p>
<p>i) The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes at which point you will see two messages “Windows cannot repair this computer automatically” and “Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically”.</p>
<p>J) Close this message window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the Send/Don’t send window. Next click on the ‘View advanced options for system recovery and support’ option and from the main menu once again click ‘Startup Repair’. This time
 the repair process may only that a few seconds and when prompted “Startup Repair could not detect a problem”, click ‘Finish’&nbsp; and run the ‘Startup Repair’ option one more time, click ‘Finish’, and then remove the System Repair DVD and click ‘Restart’.&nbsp; Reboot
 the computer.</p>

            Rather than getting into technicalities and analyzing log files, you should upgrade this manually. 
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else. 
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer 
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)

            Hi Ammarin,  This update is proving problematic for everyone . . . 
<br />
<br />KB4088776 has been replaced by KB4089848 which is Build 16299, you can get that update from the Microsoft Catalog at this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4089848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />Then double click the msu file you just downloaded to install that update instead . . .
<br />
<br />If after a restart you are still getting thatt annoyance, you can hide that KB4088776
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it: 
<br />

            If I'm good thinking that game was created to run under DOS. You may try this:<br />
<br />
Download and install dos emulator from here: <strong><a href="http://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dosbox.com/</a>
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> this one I guess is the most popular (If I remember I also used it) &gt; launch game using dos emulator (you will find somewhere information how to do
 this). I launched in that way some really old game, like Theme Park, and Desert Strike.<br />
<br />
Much more information about dosbox you can find at their wiki website: <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            That's most likely a hardware problem and could be an issue with the monitor or your computer.&nbsp; Check the connections.&nbsp; If at all possible test the monitor with another computer and your computer with another monitor to pin it down.<br />

<h2>            accessing files on Samsung Note 4</h2>
                    <p>Until today, I have had no issue accessing my phone files via USB drive to my Samsung Note 4.&nbsp; Today, the device did an android update that looks great.&nbsp; However, I can no longer see my files.&nbsp; The Samsung device shows up in my Windows Explorer, but with
 no files in it.&nbsp; I have a 16gb phone drive + a 64 gb card with many files in it.&nbsp; Samsung suggested it needs a download of the mobile companion.&nbsp; Yet, this companion requires OneWindow or OneNote usage, which I prefer not to use.&nbsp; I only want to copy files
 back and forth, mostly from my computer to my cell phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I see these files and transfer updates from my computer to the phone?&nbsp; I am not interested in OneWindow or OneNote (never used).</p>

<p><span><span>You can change the USB settings so that your phone will sync, charge etc. when connected to a computer. Both the MTP (Media Transfer protocol) and UMS or MSC (USB Mass

<p><span><span>Go to settings check for USB settings and enable MTP and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            how to scan multiple page document into a single file</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows10 and a Brother MFC 8220 scanner (a printer/scanner/fax with a document feeder). &nbsp;Using the Windows10 Fax and Scan App, I am able to see the scanner and initiate scans, which dutifully feeds the entire document and shows it being scanned
 page by page, but no matter what I try only the first page of the scan is in the file when it is finished. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Replacement device I recieved after a month is dead on arrival - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tejasvi singh tomar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacement device I recieved after a month is dead on arrival</h2>
                    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Bought Surface which worked barely for a month before dying. A month later I'm left with another dead replacement device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Surface Pro 2017 and it died after a month of usage. Wouldn't boot up. I right away requested a replacement. Lo, and behold! the turnaround time was generous one month. I'm CS undergrad and did projects on<em> library computers
</em>while I waited for the replacement. Fast forward a month, I have this boxed replacement in front of me and myself thinking finally I can get some work done without any hassle. Well my optimism was soon shattered when the magnificent dead shiny slate won't
 courtesy with the boot logo. Perhaps I thought service employees would haven't turned off the surface before shipping which drained all the juice during transit. I plugged it for twenty minutes, no boot. Left it plugged overnight, knowing the outcome beforehand,
 pressed power button only to be disappointed again. So here goes the result of a month of wait, I'm left with a new shiny dead surface with exact same issue as previous one. No problem, lets ask for another replacement. But only if, all I did was to twiddle
 thumbs and made sketches on MS Paint. I have a valuable internship opportunity this summer starting on 22 May and I'm left with no working device thanks to best-in-class support of Microsoft. I can't get my head around the fact that they not even bothered
 to check the replacement unit for at least to boot before shipping it to me. Quality control is terrible, at least for this model if not for the whole Surface brand and can't expect it to last for more than a year. I'm loosing time, money and a rare career
 opportunity owing to, as advertised, Microsoft's <em>premium</em> devices. No one understands that from a consumer's perspective, how frustrating this whole situation is with Microsoft to be blamed entirely. The hefty price charged for this kind of service
 isn't justified and is certainly unlawful. I would sooner upgrade to a newer model if refund was allowed than to get another replacement. Surface is a
<strong>big NO</strong> for now.</p>

<p><span>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bb5b1b10-a19f-41a2-a2f2-19e543f4dc93" title="Tejasvi Singh Tomar">

<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the reaching out Surface Community. We are very sorry to hear for what happen. This is definitely not the kind of experience we’d like you to have. Replacement devices should be checked by our
 Technicians before they ship it out. <span>W<span>e are not sure how this happen and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.
</span></span>I understand how important this is for you so I’d like to ask few things to see if there’s still something we can do to fix it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you plug the power supply do you see tip is lit? If tip is not lit, it is possible the Power Supply is defective or the charging port on the replacement device. I would also recommend to try another wall
 outlet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you turn it on, do you see a backlight on the type cover or keyboard?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also I’d like to verify when you say no boot the screen is completely black or black screen with a Surface/Windows Logo and there is a spinning dots at the bottom or long rectangle with different colors?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you tried pressing and holding the power button for full 30 seconds then press and release to turn it back on?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There is also a possibility that you can process an in-store exchange with our Microsoft store. But we may need to give&nbsp;proper expectation to this that different Microsoft stores has different policies
 depending on the management’s discretion. Also they may need to look at their stocks sometimes for exchange. We can advise to call them first&nbsp;to save time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please keep us posted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards, </span></p>
<p><span>Karen</span></p>

<p>The tip gets lit inconsistently. (sometimes it is lit, sometimes not) I'm able to charge my phone using the USB port on adapter. So most likely it isn't adapter issue. I've tried with multiple outlets as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, as I said device is completely dead. There's no backlight on type cover and the screen is completely black with no logo or anything. No change on pressing button for 30s and turning on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The city I live in has no store within 200 mile radius. So visiting store isn't feasible. If I get refund I could buy some other laptop and salvage my internship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much prefer to have an upgrade because this model for sure is too unreliable for my busy academic life.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is there a setting to enable the Up button in Windows 7 Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I ran updates recently but I'm not sure if Microsoft has ever added the Up button on Explorer because I can't find a setting to enable it. Is there some place to enable it? I find it irritating having to click a parent folder that might not even be visible
 or legible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Up button is actually available when trying to open or save a file, so I don't understand the inconsistency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also trying to help computer newbs or people who don't use their computer often (like my mom) is frustrating because I'm like "go up a folder" and they're like "What?" and I have to say "click on that folder named [blah blah blah]". I don't consider removing
 the Up button an upgrade.</p>

            <p>You can try using the "Alt&nbsp;+ UpArrow " key combination on the keyboard, but if you really want the up button in explorer, the best solution is probably the 3rd party [freeware] app&nbsp;"Classic Shell"</p>

            <p>There is not an up arrow symbol, but you can still do it in one click.&nbsp; Just click
<strong><em>one level up the chain</em></strong>, here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you were in this folder and wanted to go "up" to the parent, just click the parent folder name in the address bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e118eb6-a554-44b6-95b8-286fa18e0f3f" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>I bet your mom would not be confused by this.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, you said "The Up button is actually available when trying to open or save a file", but that's not actually universal: it is only there if the program is requesting a legacy shell view. Try it with something like Notepad or Word, and you'll see the
 same as the Explorer behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 7 was under development, they posted to the UX blog that the up arrow was redundant and they didn't want to confuse people with two different ways to go up.&nbsp; Especially when that means that most people would never notice the enhanced address
 bar function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But -- they still put it back in Windows 8 because (go figure) very few people ever discovered or noticed the enhancement.</p>

<p>I sugest you to try in another place, with another connection. If no issues found, maybe your router needs an reset</p>
<p>You can also try this troubleshoot: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/unable-to-connect-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Okay this might seem simplistic but give it a try anyway. &nbsp;I have had it work for a lot of users. &nbsp;Simply sign out of all profiles on the console. &nbsp;Then sign back in with the problematic profile. &nbsp;Let us know if it works for you. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>This problem has been persisting with me to. When u do network connection test it tells me Internet connection is fine, but xbox service issues. When i check status of servers on xbox everything is fine. So i do not understand what is happening.
</p>
<p>Ive reset console, routes, removed account and added again. Still the issue persists and it is really frustrating, as my console then becomes useless. i can do nothing but game online. No youtube, netflix absolutely nothing. Please advise

<p>yea i said originally, I've reset the router, I've also signed out of my profile (there is only one on there) but wasn't able to sign back in (clicking on sign in simply did nothing).</p>
<p>The only thing I haven't tried is another network.</p>

<p>I've now tried the xbox on a different network and still have the same issue.</p>
<p>If I sign out of my profile (I only have one on the machine) I can't sign back in (it does nothing) but if I reboot the machine I'm signed back in but not connected to xbox live.</p>
<p>which is moot now as I've finally been able to remove my profile from the xbox as someone suggested but now it won't let me retrieve my profile at all, keeps going to the password screen and yes my password is correct, I'm getting no error messages or anything.
 I've tested entering an incorrect password and got an error message so I know I'm entering it correctly (just logged onto this site with it) but as soon as I enter the password it comes up with the swhirl, flickers to the dashboard, comes up with the swhirl
 again and then prompts for password.</p>

<p>Same issue here. This isn't the first time it's happened to me. I had it happen a few months back, had to do a full factory restore and install everything again. It was a gigantic pain in the neck. Then I boot the Xbox One up today, shows my friends list,
 says that my internet is fine when I test it, but it says "Connect to Xbox Live" on the side and only displays "Home."</p>
<p>Personally, I feel as if the Xbox Live experience has been rather unacceptable this generation. Xbox 360 didn't give me any headaches, however the Xbox One has proven to be more of a hassle than it's worth, quite frankly. When everything works as it should,
 I enjoy the console. But there's no excuses for quirks like this to still exist. There's also no excuses for the long install times, particularly on disc-based games. These things should've been improved ages ago.</p>
<p>I own other game consoles and neither of the competitors consoles have given me issues like this. It's not your internet, it's not your hardware, it's a bug on Microsoft's end that they continue to not fix. If you can get around to that, Microsoft, I'd really
 appreciate it, as I'd love to be able to enjoy your console like I did the original Xbox and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>As of 11/1/12, all of the 2K Sports servers (with the exception of NBA 2K13 and MLB 2K12) are now offline. We do not have any information that leads us to believe these online features will be turned back on. If you have any questions, please visit the following

<p>Please note that we, here at 2k Sports Customer Support, do not have any further information regarding the status of these servers. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>

<p>That is total BS. Even EA doesn't cut their offline that quickly. Usually it happens after 3 years or so. There are thousands of gamers still playing NBA 2K12 and playing it online. WTF would 2KSports do something this stupid? They are going to lose a LOT
 of customers next year if they don't bring the servers back up.</p>
<p>Does anyone know any other way to import Draft Roster teams into the game besides using their servers?

                    I have files from an application with extensions .D0A .D0B etc. Can you give me an idea of how to open these files and view their contents ? I guess they are encrypted!&nbsp;

 taskbar on the screen when your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</span></span></p>
