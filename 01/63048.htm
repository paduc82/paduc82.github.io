<h2>            How to Access Windowsapp Folder On External Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been looking for a while and cannot seem to find an answer to my problem.&nbsp;<br />
That being said, I changed the location for windows apps to install to my new external ssd drive.&nbsp;<br />
The issue is that I am not allowed access to the windowsapp folder it created on said drive.&nbsp;<br />
I have run through the normal steps of gaining access/changing the owner of the folder to no avail (get the following error: "Can't open access control editor. Unable to perform a security operation on an object that has no associated security." - see screenshot
 below)<br />
I need access to this folder in order to copy information over, but cannot figure out how to gain that.&nbsp;<br />
I don't know a lot about computer processes so please try to be clear in your answers! :)<br />
See below for information that might be helpful.<br />
Let me know if any other additional information needs to be provided! :)<br />

            Hi Tyler,
<br />
<br />The WIndowsApps folder is one of the most protected folders on the Windows 10 operating system, to maintain the security of the Windows UWP apps, you will not be able to access that and if you do succeed, you ill probably brick your system by doing so . ..

            Hi Tyler.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You cannot move Apps to an External Drive, nor should you move them of an SSD because it will defeat the faster speed of the drive in those programs.  And there are other reasons why I would always have apps on C where they are integrated into Windows via the registry and should remain included in it's image backup.
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Thank you for your response this is all great information!&nbsp;<br />
I'm sure it will be very helpful to me!&nbsp;<br />
I think I was a little unclear though.&nbsp;<br />
The C: Drive is an HDD drive. I was attempting to move them to the new external drive that is an SSD to increase the speeds.<br />
There is an option within the windows app menu that allows me to select an app and move it to a drive, and my external drive is one of the options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Excuse me for my lack of computer knowledge. I'm sure I'm just missing something here!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Sorry just to clarify a little more.&nbsp;<br />
I do not have a space issue.&nbsp;<br />
The only reason I wanted to move an app is because the app is slow, and I read that people could move the app to an SSD drive to help increase the speed of the app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you! :)<br />

            Tyler, have you considered swapping the SSD into the PC and the HDD into the external?  This would benefit speed where it counts the most.  
<br />
<br />As far as I know one cannot move apps using the storage settings into an External Drive.  It has a switch that causes it to be treated differently when Windows recognizes where System files and apps can be moved. 
<br />
<br />I assumed that you had a space issue so you can ignore the rest of my post which covers that.  Normally those with these concerns are trying to preserve space on C, but I understand now what you wanted and I think what would benefit you most is to swap the external SSD with the HDD then do the Clean Install to the SSD for amazing speed, wipe the HDD to use for regular storage.

 .Net Framework. Ignore the title of the article and try method 3 and 4 in order. Method 3 suggests to download the update manually and install it. Method 4 suggests steps to reinstall the .Net Framework.</span></font></font></p>

            Kiran,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;It's certainly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've performed Step 1 over the past week, before reading your answer, and it has done nothing. &nbsp;After downloading it, the program starts to run and is forever stuck on the following screen. &nbsp;The installation bar never moves, or it just fails. &nbsp; I'm running
 it again right now and for 20 minutes, this is all I've seen:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95bd571a-c193-4f29-a1d6-4af281c7317c" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>As regards the second step, I've tried method 3 before and that did not help. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method four is not one I've tried and I'm currently working on it. &nbsp; I'll report back.</div>

            I performed method 4. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I finished and restarted the computer, it said two updates needed to be installed. &nbsp; The first one installed, and as usual, the second one failed. &nbsp; Here's a screenshot:
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d73537ff-487a-4e3a-a5e4-61796ccc0971" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>My question now is: &nbsp;How essential is this update? &nbsp; I've done everything possible and I can't spend too much more time on it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>ED. NOTE: &nbsp;Since posting this another 7 updates have installed successfully, and yet the one that is the subject of this article keeps failing. &nbsp; I'd also like to point out that sometimes it claims success but when you look at the update screen it says
 "failed."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your help is most appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

<p>[1] The same does not apply if/when MS <em>re-releases</em> an update - in which case the update will have a V2 on the end; e.g., KB9876543-V2,</p>

    <title>PC Constantly Processing After Win10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aidanjohns921  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Constantly Processing After Win10 Update</h2>
                    <p>This problem started only after I updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Constantly my laptop seems to be processing something but in a flicker mode. It's causing my mouse to flicker back and forth non-stop from normal to a loading cursor. It's causing my windows on screen to be inactive for about half a millisecond and then
 active again. Prevents me from playing games in full screen and when I try playing movies or videos in full screen the taskbar starts to flicker behind and to the front of the video playing in full screen. It has also made any small popup that I try pulling
 up (bookmark folder for example) close about a second or two after opening them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked all over for an answer but haven't gotten a way to fix it yet. I have looked through the task manager but haven't found anything unusual, I have also tried restarting, shutting down and then starting back up, and putting to sleep my laptop
 however nothing has been making this stop.</p>

            <p>Hi Aidan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any Display or Display Adapter driver related issues. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error code or error message while startup?</p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the computer after installing Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></li><li><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters </span>
<ul>
<li><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>
<p><span>Contact the computer or display adapter manufacturer’s website for an updated driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please feel free to visit our website for any help with Windows Operating System.</span></p>
<p />

            <p>In device manager you might try Uninstalling the display adapter, but not its driver if it should ask... then Restarting the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows should automatically discover the adapter and automatically re-install it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Often&nbsp;that's all you need to do with graphic driver problems.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting blue screen and I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is just 1 month old and just a day after I bought it the blue screen happened for no reason. I had only installed Chrome and Trend Antivirus Security and Clip Studio.</p>
<p>In the last 2 weeks I got blue screen twice. Both times when I tried to wake up the device after sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into Event Viewer. The first and second BSOD the bugcheck code was 14F and the third one was 19C.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's relevant but I have other issues on this device. Microsoft Edge closes after sleep every time. Skype keeps crashing after like 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is Surface Pro i5 8GB. Everything is up-to-date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. It seems that no dump files were created for the first two blue screen.&nbsp; After the two BSOD I changed the setting so that minidumps would be created. So I only have it for the third one.&nbsp;</p>

            The dump is not giving much info about which driver is causing the problem. 
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<p>Just a quick question...<br />
In the Write debugging information section I choose 'small memory dump (256KB) since with 'Automatic memory dump' I got an error saying " Unable to produce a minidump file from the full dump file" and no minidump files were found after the blue screen.&nbsp;<br />
Should I set it to 'Complete memory dump'?</p>

<h2>            Cannot install WIndows 10 or 8.1, but 7 works</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>tl;dr: I can install Windows 7 and it works very well, but not Windows 10.. Windows 8.1 installs but then restarts very often. Windows 8.1 and 10 give thee "Computer restarted unexpectedly.." error on (I think it is the) first boot after setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old PC (I'll post specs at the end of the post) on which I am able to install Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium x64 without any problems, but Windows 8.1 and 10 both give the "Computer restarted unexpectedly..." error:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - on 8.1 I was actually able to use the the "SHIFT+F10, regedit" trick to try and fix it, but then although the OS boots, it restarts very often and all of a sudden, so I cannot use it. What's very interesting is the fact that if I boot into safe mode,
 it seems to work well, without restarts. However, booting into safe mode with networking does not work. I thought maybe my network card is problematic, so I tried to remove it, but that does not solve the problem. I, however, know that my motherboard-integrated
 network card is broken, so maybe that is a possible problem (I remember that in the past, my computer used to restart (don't remember what OS I had exactly, probably 8.1 or 7) when Internet was unplugged from the motherboard's network card (which was working
 at that time, as far as I remember) or even manually disconnected from Windows (</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - on Windows 10 x64 I couldn't even do the regedit trick because after the error pops up, after a while everything gets stuck (including the console I opened and Windows' loading white dots in the background). I was, however, able to open the command
 prompt and do the regedit modification by booting into safe mode instead (and there I was shown a different error, saying installation cannot be completed in safe mode, which allowed me to do the SHIFT F10 thing, but this time it didn't get stuck in the process).
 However, after doing this and restarting, the computer either restarts when Windows is still loading, or gets stuck as previously, so installation does not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I actually tried moving the GPU in the other PCI-E slot on the motherboard, only using one of the RAM sticks, disconnecting the CD-ROM and one of the HDDs and disconnecting my network. HOWEVER, isn't it a bit doubtful that hardware is the actual problem
 since Windows 7 actually works FLAWLESSLY with all hardware connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PC specs:</p>
<p>MB: Asus M2N-E SLI</p>
<p>CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+&nbsp;</p>
<p>RAM: 4x1GB sticks ; a total of&nbsp; 4GB of DDR2-800</p>
<p>HDD: two: both WD, one is 160GB, the other is 500GB, both are old, but SMART diagnostics show they're in "good" state</p>
<p>GPU: GTS 450</p>

<h2>            Unable to download my profile</h2>
                    
<p>Why can't I download my Xbox Live profile? I was having problems with getting signed out of Xbox Live for no reason so following some advice that I read I deleted my profile, cleared the system cache and attempted download my profile. All I ever get is a
 "Sorry, Xbox LIVE profiles can't be downloaded right now. Try again later" error message. Sometimes I get as far as entering my profile's password but more often than not it craps out after entering my profile's email address. The message has been accompanied
 by varying error codes. 80072751, 800704CD, 80072741 are the codes I've noted.</p>
<p>These are the things I've tried so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removed hard-drive, reformatted internal memory, cleared system cache and attempted to download profile.
</li><li>UPnP enabled on router. Xbox has dynamic IP and static DNS configuration. Ran a connection test, no NAT issues. Attempted to download profile with no luck.
</li><li>Forwarded ports 53, 80, 88, 1863, 3074 (UDP/TCP) to Xbox on a static IP. Ran a connection test but had moderate NAT problem. Attempted to download profile with no luck.
</li><li>Put the Xbox on a static IP and gave made that IP a DMZ. Ran a connection test but had moderate NAT problem. Attempted to download profile with no luck.
</li><li>I've given the Xbox static IP's both inside and outside of the router's DHCP range.
</li><li>I've tried two different DSL/routers. A Linksys WAG54G2 and a TP-LINK TD-W8960N. In both cases I had moderate NAT problem when port forwarding or DMZ was used.
</li><li>I've logged into live.com, xbox.com, etc with my profile with no problem. My billing and payment info is correct. Gone back to the Xbox, reset system cache and attempted to download profile with no luck.
</li></ol>
<p>This is seriously frustrating. I've wasted 2 days trying to sort this out. I'm so close to cancelling my Gold subscription.</p>

<p>Hi There....you want to try and sign in at account.live.com and do a little bit of account maintenance first. When you get there, go down to where it says edit security info. You want to make sure that you have at least 3 of the vitals here. An alternate
 email address, a phone number (preferably a cell phone) and just change the secret question. Make sure you save at the end.
</p>
<p>When that is done, move on to the console. Make sure you don't have too many profiles on there. If you do, that too can prevent you from downloading the profile. On the controller hit the guide button ? settings &gt; system settings &gt; storage &gt; highlight the
 hard drive and then press the Y button. Choose clear system cache and do that a total of 3 times.</p>
<p>When that is done, go into the hard drive folders to system items. Delete the rights database and the marketplace system data if you have them.
</p>
<p>When done, turn off the console and wait about 30 seconds before turning back on. Once it's on again, try downloading the profile again to the console.</p>
<p>The key here is account.live.com. Something there has to change or be added. </p>
<p>Hope this helps you.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to help. I forgot to mention in my original post that I had tried updating my security proofs on account.live.com. Regardless, I tried the steps you suggested but it didn't work. I don't have any profiles on my Xbox as I removed the hard
 drive containing profiles and save games and reformatted the internal memory in a previous attempt to get this working. One thing I find strange is the length of time it takes to bring up the screen for entering my email after selecting "Download Profile".
 It spends about 10-15 seconds thinking about it. </p>

<p>OK so another tid-bit of information of something else I tried. I live in New Zealand. I set up a router to make a PPTP connection to a VPN in the USA and connected my Xbox to this router. Essentially making the Xbox appear to be located in the USA. I then
 tried downloading my profile. This time it let me enter both my email and my password and there was no strange delay like I mentioned in my previous post. But it still didn't work, I got an incorrect email or password error message even though I definitely
 entered them correctly (I tried multiple times and used the same credentials to log into account.xbox.com). What's going on Microsoft? How about some customer support here?</p>

<p>Hi JhonatanNZ, </p>
<p>The forum that petercusttiss its verify good.</p>
<p>But you can try delete xbox 360 update from your storage device, download it again then download profile again.</p>
<p>Here the steps to delete system update.</p>
<p>- Go To Settings, and then select Storage</p>
<p>- Highlight Hard Drive</p>
<p>- On your controller, press the following button sequence:</p>
<p>Press the left bumper.</p>
<p>Press the right bumper.</p>
<p>Press the X button.</p>
<p>Press the left bumper.</p>
<p>Press the right bumper.</p>
<p>Press the X button.</p>
<p>- Power cycle Console</p>
<p>- Then take update.</p>
<p>If that does not works</p>
<p>Try Use USB Flash Drive as the main storage device (Hard Drive Must be Off) you may need to download update it it too.</p>

<p>Hi guys, this I am up in the north in Dargaville here in New Zealand, EXACTLY the same issue as this, I have done all these troubleshooting steps standing on one foot one finger in my nose, then id do it with fingers in other places while doing troubleshooting
 in different orders, still nothing. &nbsp;My original problem was we could not stay connected to Live for longer than 3 minutes it would disconnect, so sign right back in again, 3 mins later disonnect. &nbsp;So one of the troubleshooting steps was deleting profile and
 reinstalling and of course cannot just the same as OP. &nbsp;Iv had 3 long conversations with xbl phone support and this is still unresolved for me, had Chorus come to my place because I was questioning my ISP. &nbsp;Just like OP it hangs sometimes before u can put
 in the email account (for downloading profiles) and then i can never put in a password get the same errors as OP.</p>

<p>Hi Aph1dy0, I'm with Flip.co.nz as my ISP. &nbsp; I also noticed on their support forum that someone else was having the same issue. &nbsp; Flip monitored the person's account and they could see the disconnects happening. &nbsp;They logged a fault with Chorus but I'm now
 waiting to see if anything came of it. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Just like you, I still can't download my profile and the xbox live connection still drops off every three minutes or so. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>It looks like this all started around the 20th April 2013 or there abouts.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hey Petecuttriss &amp; Aph1dy0 I am with Flip also. I've finally managed to download my profile as of about 30 seconds ago. After all my frustration I gave up trying to resolve the issue for a few days and then tried again last night. The difference this time
 was that I no longer got the "profiles can't be downloaded right now" error and could enter in my email and password. But the next problem was that no matter what I did I was continually getting an "incorrect email/password" error. Today I saw a forum post
 where someone mentioned that if you had two-factor authentication set up on your account you can't just enter your regular account password. You have to generate a special "app password". And yes, when following previous advice to update security proofs I
 had turned on two-factor authentication. Check out this blog:</p>
<p><a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/04/19/using-microsoft-two-factor-authentication-with-your-xbox-live-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">majornelson.com/.../using-microsoft-two-factor-authentication-with-your-xbox-live-account</a></p>
<p>I suspect Flip had some issues and that in the process of trying to resolve the problem I caused another problem. Give it a go and fingers crossed it works for you. I'm just glad my gold subscription pre-paid for a year hasn't gone to waste!</p>

<p>Thanks for the update JhonatanNZ, unfortunately this still isn't working for me. &nbsp; I'm still getting the "profiles can't be downloaded right now" error. &nbsp; I didn't have two-factor authentication setup so I gave that a go and set it up also, but everytime
 I go to download my profile it basically times out and loses the connection after 3 minutes or so and gives the "profiles can't be downloaded right now" error. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm still monitoring the Flip support forum also for any updates there also.... &nbsp;Glad you can
 make use of your gold subscription... my is slowly wasting away.</p>

<p>Hello MaguiVili,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The default keyboard layout and it's hardware depend on where you would purchase the device. If your device is purchased from Microsoft&nbsp;in the United&nbsp;States, then it would come with the default En-Us keyboard hardware and&nbsp;layout. However, there are options
 in Windows 10 to change a keyboard layout in the software&nbsp;by installing&nbsp;other language packages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would not change how the physical buttons themselves actually appear on the keyboard, but it will format the typing recognition&nbsp;to the keyboard layout that correlates to the language you have installed and enabled&nbsp;for the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions feel free to respond to this post. Or if it's a different question entirely, please create a new thread.</p>

<p>I wrote a driver and i want to install it to my PC, i did every step i've found to disable driver signature like Shift+restart then choose the 7th option "disable driver signature enforcement" or using commands "bcdedit /set testsigning on"</p>
<p>But after all windows still showed up the notification that "windows blocked the installation of a digitally unsigned driver".

            <p>Please stop stalling and reply to this question, the question is related to the installation of drivers and its issues and was posted in the correct forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish people at M$ would start giving us some answers for the money we spent buying this crappy OS instead of giving us the runaround. I get the runaround from Windows 10, I don't need you guys doing it neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 3rd party drivers that Microsoft enforces to install are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) worthless, non functional and buggy</p>
<p>2) outdated (I get my stuff directly from NVidia)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have literally wasted numerous hours to try to accomplish one simple thing that took me about 5 minutes in Windows 7 in the past. Turning driver enforcement off on Windows 10 running in Test mode.</p>
<p>
So who at Microsoft do I send the bill to for all those wasted hours ?<br />

    <title>Skype Preview has disappeared from Tablet running Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Preview has disappeared from Tablet running Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Linx 7 tablet running Windows 10 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Anniversary Update 1607 10.0.14393.447</span>. It seems, somehow to have Skype 7.15 but no Skype Preview. However,&nbsp;for the last 2 weeks Windows Store has been&nbsp;trying to download an update to Skype Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling Skype 7.15 and download Preview from the Store, but all the Store will give me is the Update to Preview, which as far as I can see, has gone missing. So I've reinstalled Skype, 7.30 from the Skype website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either: Stop the Store trying to download Skype Preview Update when it doesn't, to all intents and purposes, exist on the Tablet any more,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or: Fix the installation of Skype Preview, or reinstall it afresh.</p>

            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue is related to Windows Store that prompts you to download Skype Preview, we recommend you reset Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset Windows Store follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Reset the Store cache.
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> keys to open the run command box.</li><li>Type <strong>WSReset</strong>, then restart your device.</li></ol>
</li><li>Method 2: Windows Store PowerShell command.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>PowerShell</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>PowerShell</strong>, click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>If the User Account Control dialog box appears, confirm and then click <strong>
Continue</strong>.</li><li>Copy and paste or type the command powershell -<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ExecutionPolicy
 Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml</span></strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Reboot the computer to take effect the changes. </li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Neither of these solutions worked. Indeed, when I tried Method 2, it failed with the message that&nbsp;it could not find the path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, the update to 14393.479 seemed to fix the problem. The tablet did report a problem with the SSD which needed to be rectified, when it was rebooting after the 479 installation. After rebooting and SSD rectification, everything was working perfectly,
 Skype Preview reappeared, and subsequently the Store Updates to Preview have been applied without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have to find out why this week's Store update to Outlook Mail and Calendar has, extremely inconveniently, managed to delete ALL my calendar entries going forward. I even saw one diary date disappear off the calendar in front of my eyes,
 so I know I'm not imagining things.</p>

    <title>some files are missing your windows installation or recovery media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chaunfarmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            some files are missing your windows installation or recovery media will provide these files</h2>
                    Really micorosft, you have to require a disk in order to restore your computer. Let me ask you something HOW MANY COMPUTERS ACTUALLY COME WITH A MEDIA DISK FOR WINDOWS? My guess is close to 0. Well seeing as I have a corrupt file from Apple, and cannot
 remove it, my processing is so bad now that my computer is constantly over using it's processing and ram, all of which is coming from SYSTEM, which is somethign I simply cannot remove in Task Manager, so I decide, ohh, hey, let's restart my computer to factory
 settings, but yay, another thing you decide to **** your customers over. Love it, absolutely love it. My keyboard just broke from all the rage, and at this point I'm on the verge of a mental break down, all because companies do not look towards their customers
 anymore, and what ways can make them the most money. Is there any way to restore Windows 8 without a media disk, as my computer is from CyberPowerPC and they do not give out media disks for windows 8, I simply have the serial number and that's it. What the
 **** do I do now?

I need my computer completely restored as my processing is 100% all the time, and my RAM fluctuates from 100% all from System. I went to use Restore to factory settings, or the Windows 8's trash version of it, and get this error.&nbsp;some files are missing your
 windows installation or recovery media will provide these files. Well, 99.999999999999999999% of companies do not give you a media disk/windows 8 disk. They give you the Windows 8 key and that's it. What do I do?</div>

            Everyone knows that when you get a new computer you have to make your own recovery disk with the provided software if it doesn't have a separate partition for that, It's been like that for atleast 10 years since they stopped sending a disc and started
 having it where you make it yourself

            <p>Clean boot did not help. Windows 10 is still crashing when copying files or trying to image my main hard drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However- This time, I opened my case and pulled my SSD drive (main Windows 10 drive) and sat it so I could see the lights on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as the computer froze, the light on the SSD went from Green to Red, and stayed red even after Windows rebooted my computer, and for some reason causing my BIOS not to be able to read the drive, thus making it a boot failure as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, when I turned the power off with the front button and turned it back on, it booted up just fine. May have taken about 10-20 seconds longer, but still booted as if nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the files I was trying to move (not just copy), it wrote the folder to the destination but did not move the files (photographs and folders with photographs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated, this happens also when I try to create an image of my Windows drive. I've been trying to move photos that were stored on the main drive to a physical drive which has been checked and found to have no errors or bad sectors, at least none that
 would show up on chkdsk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Physical hard drive on order and will probably do a clean install of Windows 10, but I thought I would let you know there, that while I really love the Windows 10 OS, I think it could still use some work. As with all new Operating systems I'm
 sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading this, and I hope my clean install goes well on the new drive.</p>

            <p>same problem constantly. I have a new Thinkpad W550s with Core i7 and 16MB RAM. It came with Windows 7 then upgraded it to Windows 10 then the problem started. I may try a clean install of windows 10. If it does not work I will install windows 7 again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try to open Task Manager and select Performance Monitor. On my PC the CPU is very often at 100% load especially with one has the drag and drop problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also lot's of lag problems, when trying to open File Explorer nothing happen then after several seconds it opens up.
</p>
<p>Interesting that when I run Windows 10 on a MAC machine in virtual environment I have no problems at all.</p>

            <p>When I use File Explorer search to discover files with a particular extension ("*.odt" for example) on an internal drive (D) the window, within a few seconds, correctly shows all the discovered files including duplicates. &nbsp;I use the "select all" button then
 the "copy to" button and choose the destination drive in order to place the selected files into a folder on another internal drive (F). &nbsp;At this point one of two things happen</p>
<p>1) Explorer crashes before I get the "duplicates found" dialog.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) The "duplicates found" dialog appears - so I select "let me choose" and then tick both columns (in order to have all duplicates with a numbered suffix).</p>
<p>When I click on OK Explorer crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB - the above similarly occurs if a manual "select/copy" and "paste" is carried out instead of using the menu buttons.</p>

    <title>Groove Music app offline when searching for Album Info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music app offline when searching for Album Info</h2>
                    <p>Under the Groove Music app, when playing a song you have the option to click on the "...more" button for other options.&nbsp; 2 issues come up when that happens.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Clicking on "Find album info" will oftentimes bring up the error message "Not available offline" even though I have a network connection.</li><li>When click on "Find album info" and it actually does connect, after selecting the album info you want you cannot click on the back arrow on the top left corner or it will shut the app down (and not save the info).&nbsp; Instead you need to click another button
 like Artists or Albums so it won't shut down.</li></ol>
<p>Are these bugs that will be addressed by Microsoft?</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, this didn't help.</p>
<p>I have added my music library to the Groove app in Win10. If I start the app without logging in I can see my albums have cover images and all looks fine. This lasts for 2-3 mins and the some of the are falling away and if I then try to update the album info
 it says it can't be done offline. The same happens if I log in with my account.</p>
<p>So it seems the app is losing it's connection after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Any response to that is much appreciated, I Think the app looks really good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Can I assume this is a simple cut and past answer to ALL Modern UI app issues because this issue occurs when the app is logged in as well so the app most definitely is online. Not only that but about 1 in 100 times finding album info actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to say this but you need to READ the issue BEFORE giving us a response.</p>

            <p>98Signing out, restarting, signing back in works for a minute. Troubleshooting does nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have endured Windows 3.0, 3.1, 95, 98, XP, Millennium, 7, 8.1, 10 and now 10 - 1511. XP was Good and so was 7. But 10 is really buggy. It seems Microsoft uses the world as a giant beta tester. Then slowly fixes things.</p>

            Well, I'm having this issue too and the troubleshooter is as useless as Windows Help has always been. It says it can't detect the problem. And even though my music library has album art over 99% of it in iTunes, in Groove Music that drops to around 40-50%.
 Pretty strange, considering the artwork is already there. I'll just keep thinking of Groove Music as junk until Microsoft decides to man up and make their program competitive. At the very least, we don't need sarcastic IT people reposting the exact same solution
 because they assume we're too stupid to try the fix they're pushing. It just doesn't work.

 what could I expect? </span></p>

<p>Your a$$ to be handed to you for one thing. Slight learning curve. If you have any sense you should be able to pick up on what the game's about and how the game works after about 4 full games. You'll still have alot to learn, but at least by then you won't
 be totally clueless. Don't do like every other new player to the game and snipe. Start out as assault or medic class and learn to drop health and ammo packs at every opportunity. Best way to learn the game is to be in the middle of the madness. Go to options
 and bump up the sensitivity if you feel the player movement is sluggish. Play with friends if possible, it helps make the game less frustrating. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Cod is a mindless run &amp; gun&nbsp;shooting full of lone wolfs. BF is what I like to call, "A THINKING MAN'S WAR GAME" with means team work is the most important aspect. Its very explosive, lots of demolition and at times very disorientating. Alot of new player
 don't last long between spawns and like already said alot of new players snipe, but sniping on BF is not like Cod there's bullet drop to start with (Means you need to aim above targets and something shoot where they will be when the target is moving).
</p>
<p>If you decide to buy BF then prepare to die alot, Its takes a long time and many hours of mistakes to become pro at it. There is a BF3&nbsp;multi-player beta coming to all formats in Sep, good chance to get some hands on game-play before you buy it. Also be warned
 that BF Bad Company 2 needs a online pass, so pay the extra for a new copy. (also goes for BF3)</p>
<p>Buy BF as its the best FPS&nbsp;series I have ever played. But getting into BF come at a cost, you will become to hate COD games. I know I did.</p>

<p>Expect it to be different, Battelfield plays at a slower pace in a way but more tactical and with more teamwork involved. Bullets have Gravity too so farther you shoot the bullet will drop. There is learning curve and for the love of god don't add in teh

            All retail store bought licenses 1 computer only, whether thats a physical or virtual machine. You can always purchase additional licenses (up to 20 from the store) or OEM Packs and use the licenses. 
<br />
<br />MSDN Licenses permit up to 10 activations per key or 1500 for the Windows 10 Enterprise client.

            If this is just a test environment you are building Microsoft has Windows 10 you can use free for 90 days.  I use it all the time.
<br />You can get all there software and try it out at the Technet Evaluation Center.

<br />
<br />There is also a VDA Windows 10 license but it is costly and I can not find anywhere on how many licenses you actually get.  I can see why you are asking.  
<br />The link below is CDW, you might be able to call them and ask them how many activations you can have with the VDA.

<p><span>Follow the steps listed below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) What is the exact error message with a specific error code you get?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b) What is the make and model number of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span><b><span> Remove and then reinstall the device:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound, and then click Bluetooth Devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;Select the device that's not working, and then click Remove.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
