<h2>            Next Sword&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I'm not great at this game knowledge wise, and I was hoping I could attain some assistance in that department. I am currently still using the Drake Sword, but since I'm almost SLvL40 I figured it was about time to change that up. My build is mostly
 strength (level 25 atm) and faith (18). My intelligence is so low it's not even worth mentioning, and my Dexterity is 13 (not great, I know).</p>
<p>Basically I want a sword that would be good to use after the drake sword and that is mainly strength, possibly with some faith if there are any good ones out there.</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again!</p>

<p>Oh and as a side note, I like quicker weapons. But again; as long as it's strength scaling is good it's not a huge deal to me, I'll get used to it.</p>

<p>With a strength of 25 you could pick up the GraveLord sword(str24)wich I find to be pretty good.It has a very usable jump attack for bosses.Only it doesent scale very good with neither str,nor dex,but does have great base damedge.You get that from joining
 the gravelord servants Down in the catacombs.You could also go for the large Club(str26)Not to be mistaken for the great Club wich are both found in Blighttown.The large Club comes as a drop from one of those boulderrolling giants,and has a B-grading for strength.Both
 the gravelordsword,and the large Club has poison wich imho makles them even more nasty.The large Club is upgraded like a standard weapon upto +15 whereas the gravelordsword is upgraded like a bosssoul weapon with demon titanite.None are very fast im afraid</p>

<p>You'll find that STR weapons are not as fast as DEX weapons, so if you're set on using STR, you'll have slower weapons. &nbsp;SOB Buliwyf gave some good suggestions. &nbsp;To add to that, you could grab the Zweihander (24 STR) &nbsp;from the cemetary or the Great axe (32
 STR - but you can 2-hand it right now) from the Depths. &nbsp;Those only have C scaling for STR though.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Man Serpent Greatsword (24 STR) has B scaling until you level it up high enough, at which point it changes to A scaling. &nbsp;Same goes for the Demon Great Machete (40 STR - you can 2-hand it at 27 STR) and the Butcher Knife (24 STR). &nbsp;The Demon's Great
 axe has A scaling, but requires 46 STR (you could 2-hand it at 31 STR). &nbsp;The Great Club (28 STR) also goes to A scaling once you level it up enough.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the help guys! I actualy do have Zweihander and Great Axe, but they feel kinda slow to me and I sometimes end up getting hit before I'm even able to land a blow - which sucks against certain enemies that do a ton of damage each shot (Just
 killed Havel the Rock - took 7 attempts but finally got him!)</p>
<p>Yeah I realize that it might be a good idea to level up dex a little bit more.
</p>
<p>So where is the Serpent Greatsword you mentioned, Red?</p>

<p>Hal is pretty good, but my Dex sucks. I suppose I could get it up some, but is it too late for that? I'm already SL40 and my Dex has fallen far behind my Str and Faith.</p>

<p>It's never too late, as long as you don't mind continually leveling up. &nbsp;But, if you level up too much, then you will have difficulty finding co-op help in the areas that you go to.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for faith weapons, you can grab Astora's straight sword from the Valley of the Drakes. &nbsp;Later in the game you'll also be able to use the Crescent Axe. &nbsp;You'll also be able to obtain the Grant, which requires 50 Str and 30 Fth.</p>

<p>I've got the straight sword, but somebody told me it was a crappy weapon to level up because it was awful later in the game. If that's the case, I don't want to waste any Titanite on it.</p>
<p>Where do I get the Crescent Axe and Grant?</p>

<h2>            Power Options and Task Manager is unavailable after update for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm writing today I have found yet another defect in Windows 10, and this one is actually quite serious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to access my power options or my task manager after the most recent update. This is a known issue, I am aware. But it perfectly represents the gigantic failure that is the Windows 10 update system. I have tried the posted fixes (even though I
 am completely uncomfortable having to go in a modify the core files of my computer) and have had no success. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. If you are going to hold us hostage with a new and inferior OS and its regular and broken updates, then you need to fix the
 problems for your customers as they arise. When I ask you to fix these issues, I don't mean that you should give us ways to modify the files ourselves to fix your broken product, I mean put out another one of your dreaded updates to fix the problems that you
 have created so that your customers don't have to stumble their way through the process of trying to do it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely disappointed with Microsoft...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Login Screen flashes and disappears</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently upgraded my window 7 to Window 10 (Home).</p>
<p>After upgrade I am not able to login using my Microsoft account. When I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;Settings--&gt;Account, it shows my local account.</p>
<p>When I click on "Sign in with a micosoft account instead", the screen flashes and disappears.</p>
<p>The same thing (flash screen and disappear)&nbsp;also happens when I try to install any application from store, not able to install any app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p />

            <p>HI Rishabh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply, however the problem is still same.</p>
<p>After I entered wsreset.exe, application store launched and when I tried to sign in , it asked me to choose an account.</p>
<p>When I clicked on Microsoft account the screen flashed away and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;observed following event in event log frequently :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Activation of app Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy!App failed with error: The application cannot be started because it is currently updating. See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational log for additional information."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this is correlated with problem in any way, this is just my own observation.</p>

            I'm having the same issue and cannot login to my microsoft account from anything (store/xbox/cortana etc) as the login simply disappears. Is there anyway around without resetting the pc as this will remove all the apps and updates I have done?

<p>Is the file extension for the Kapersky download that you are trying to install a .exe, or a .msi file type?</p>
<p>Uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to see extensions.</p>
<p>If it is a Setup.exe have you tried right-clicking on the Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?</p>

Can you extract.msi to another folder, and find a Setup.exe to right-click on and "Run As Administrator"?&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere fact that you can then get away from the .msi extension and work with the extracted setup.exe (perhaps even from Safe Mode) might get you over

<span>Hi marciejs,<br />
<br />
- Does the error message appear only while installing Kaspersky? <br />
- Do the other programs install without any issue? <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below to fix Windows Installer errors:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unregister and then reregister Windows Installer service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>cmd</strong>, right-click and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type the following commands and hit Enter after each command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>msiexec /unreg</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>msiexec /regserver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check for the status of&nbsp;<strong>Windows Installer
</strong>service and make sure that it’s set to <strong>Automatic</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>services.msc</strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Installer
</strong>service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the service and select&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Now, right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Installer
</strong>service and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Under&nbsp;<strong>General</strong> tab, make sure the
<strong>Startup type</strong> is set to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may now check for the dependency services of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows Installer.</span></strong><span>To
 check for the dependency service, right-click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows Installer&nbsp;</span></strong><span>and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties
</strong><span>and<strong> </strong>click<strong> </strong>the&nbsp;<strong>Dependencies
</strong></span>tab.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the status of the dependency services is also set to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Empty user and system "temp" folders.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type&nbsp;<strong>%systemdrive%\temp
</strong>and hit Enter. Select all and empty this folder.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type&nbsp;<strong>%systemdrive%\Documents and Settings\%username%\Local
 Settings\Temp </strong>and hit Enter. Select all and empty this folder, too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing Kaspersky now and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft - Realms Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Earlier today, I was trying to get into my Realms, but this error message appeared:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/203593b6-0045-4d79-bfe7-a0ab226d7db2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/203593b6-0045-4d79-bfe7-a0ab226d7db2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This is something that tends to happen regularly, but restarting the game clears it up. However, this did not work. My privacy settings allow Realms as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5687366a-f74f-4345-9e63-6a6b8ce3d712?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5687366a-f74f-4345-9e63-6a6b8ce3d712?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>My worlds are not syncing either. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Minecraft several times.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With issues like this one, uninstalling and reinstalling the game would be the primary troubleshooting step that
</p>
<p>
</p><p>we&nbsp;would attempt to fix the issue. Since the syncing issue is happening within the game, that'd be more on the developer's servers&nbsp;side.

    <title>Audio Playback Cracking, Popping, and Skipping Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xenathode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Playback Cracking, Popping, and Skipping Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I bought a new desktop semi recently and my audio playback was fine. On 6/29/14 the audio started crackling/popping. I just dealt with it for a while, but now it has become an infuriating annoyance. (This is on windows 8.1) I re-installed my audio drivers
 to no avail. I tried disabling all enhancements, yet again to no avail. I've troubleshooted my audio playback, but nothing was detected. I don't know if this is related but when I have some sort of video (for example) I will open a program in the background
 that will play sound (such as Minecraft or LoL) and mute their sounds and the popping/crackling will stop. I don't understand how such a thing would happen. I thought about if anything might have happened on the 29th, but at the time of the start of cracking/popping
 I was watching YouTube. If anyone has a solution I will be very grateful. Sorry for the long post.

            <p>PranavMishra5582,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I used to reinstall my audio drivers was through downloading an .exe installer from the manufacturers website. (in this case Realtek HD)</p>
<p>However, I am not entirely sure of what information you are requesting when you say "Make and Model." Could you direct me to a method of finding this information out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I re-installed my drivers again with still no luck. I downloaded and ran a DPC Latency checker, but when it started running the cracking stopped, so it could not detect it. I still don't understand how this happened.</p>

            Ok, well something crazy happened. Tonight, 7/11/14 the problem has resolved itself... I don't know how. The issue was present the same day, and I had given up on messing with settings. Windows had an update so I think that may have fixed it somehow. Thanks
 for the support anyway! :D

            Reset Your Windows 10 Account Password
<br />
<br />From the Login screen click the “I forgot my password” link under the password field.
<br />
<br />The email address for your Microsoft account will be in the account field. If you have multiple Microsoft accounts, make sure you have the correct one typed in. And then verify the Captcha code to verify you’re not a robot.
<br />
<br />Then you will need to select the recovery address from the drop-down list and complete the hidden part of your email shown on the screen. If you don’t have a recovery email set up, then you’ll be pointed to live.com/acsr to recover your account.
<br />
<br />Then from your phone or another computer, check that recovery email you chose and find the account code then type it into the field to verify your identity.
<br />
<br />After that, you’ll be walked through a few more steps. Type in a new password that you’d like to use and click Next to continue. You will get a message letting you know the password change was successful, and be brought back to the login screen. Type in the new password you just created to get into your machine.
<br />
<br />This subtle but helpful new experience makes it easier to initiate the password reset process. Keep in mind that this changes your Microsoft account password everywhere. So, the next time you log into Bing, Outlook.com, or other Microsoft services, you will need to use the new password.

<p>Hello Talissonluks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We understand that you are trying to launch Battlefield 1, but it is giving you an error message that is&nbsp;advising you&nbsp;to renew your Xbox Live Gold membership. The reason you see this error message is due to
 the fact that on <strong>Xbox One</strong>, you’ll no longer be able to access your
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/xbox-live-membership/games-with-gold-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Games with Gold </a>titles if you cancel your subscription. However, if you decide to renew your subscription at any time, you’ll be able to access and play your previously redeemed Games with Gold titles again. On
<strong>Xbox 360</strong>, any Games with Gold titles that you redeem as an Xbox Live Gold member are yours to keep, regardless of whether you continue your subscription. We hope this helps!</p>
        </p>

If you do, there is a little switch on the side of the adapter you need to push up toward the terminal end.</p>

<p>The rules also state you can't have anything that refers to or insinuates sexual themes. In your case the word "pimpin" is a nod to prostitution.

<h2>            access denied problem</h2>
                    <p>I had to revert my computer to an earlier date due a virus. Since then I am getting access denied error messages for folders where I appear to still have full access under the security settings. Any ideas ?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>A) First be sure you have rid yourself of the virus:</p>
<p>Virus Removal Info<br />
Download the free version of Malwarebytes, it will detect and remove most viruses.<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>Norton Power Eraser <br />
<a href="http://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.asp?lcid=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.asp?lcid=1033</a><br />
Note: Because the Norton Power Eraser uses aggressive methods to detect these threats,
<br />
there is a risk that it can select some legitimate programs for removal. <br />
You should use this tool very carefully, and only after you have exhausted other options.</p>
<p><br />
Microsoft Standalone System Sweeper Beta (Can be installed on a CD, DVD, or USB drive):
<br />
<a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper</a><br />
A recovery tool that can help you start an infected PC and perform an offline scan to help identify and remove rootkits and other advanced malware. In addition, Microsoft Standalone System Sweeper Beta can be used if you cannot install or start an antivirus
 solution on your PC, or if the installed solution can’t detect or remove malware on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) <strong>How do I restore security settings to the default settings?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313222</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>Right click on the Windows.old folder and select 'Properties' click on permittions tab, now you should see the permittion options settings.</p>
<p>In the security window click on 'Administrators' and in the boxes check the "full control" permission, click 'Apply' and the 'OK' buttons.</p>

To take ownership of a file or folder</p>
<p>1. Open Windows Explorer, and then locate the file or folder you want to take ownership of.<br />
2. Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.<br />
3. Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.<br />
4. Click Edit, and then do one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click Other users and groups and, in Enter the object name to select (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.</p>
<p>5. (Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play DVD-R or DVD-RW...why&#63;</h2>
                    I have mini dvds from a camcorder I used to have. Now I am trying to play them olaptop but they won't play. I have downloaded different software and even went and bought a and bought a dvd writer as directed from geek squad. Even in this drive it is saying
 there is no disc. I've spent hours downloading all of this stuff and nothing has worked. How can I get these home movies to play other than going out and buying a new camcorder to watch them in? Please help!

    <title>OFX Import Problems in Money Plus Sunset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OFX Import Problems in Money Plus Sunset</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently using Money Plus Sunset and trying to import OFX files. The system is a fresh install that has not had any prior version of Money on it. The .mny opens fine. It was last updated a week or so before end of service using Sunset on the prior
 system.</p>
<p>I'm trying to update my accounts by OFX download from my FI (USAA). I can download either the OFX or QFX with no problem. Opening them in a text editor, I can see information on recent transactions in several accounts. When I first tried to import into Money,
 I was asked which account to associate the file with. I picked one of the accounts, and that account was updated.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not sure how to set up Money to accept the data for the other accounts in the OFX, or if something else is going on. Any help is appreciated.</p>
