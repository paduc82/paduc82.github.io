    <title>Bluetooth switch not showing in Windows 8.1 PC Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennyreid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth switch not showing in Windows 8.1 PC Settings</h2>
                    <p>Until about 2 weeks ago my bluetooth was working fine. I can see that it is installed however when I go to PC Settings bluetooth is not showing at all so I am unable to switch it back on. Could you please tell me where to go and find it. Windows has updated
 several time in the last month. I have tried doing a restore to before last update but it made no difference. I have a HP notebook 15 laptop</p>
<p>

    <title>runtime error during system boot SMBIOS unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annacakemaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            runtime error during system boot SMBIOS unavailable</h2>
                    When I boot my PC which runs on windows vista, I get the message "not enough space in runtime area SMBIOS data will not be available press F1 to resume".&nbsp; I press F1 and the system finishes the process, but when I open Internet Explorer, "the webpage cannot
 be displayed".&nbsp; I have checked the memory and there is plenty, I have checked my internet connection (which is a wired/broadband connection), and there are no problems (I get internet on my other wireless devices in the home so I know I have no connection
 problems).&nbsp; I have searched solutions and performed as many as I could.&nbsp; I believe that my internet connectivity issue is a result of the error I receive during the system boot.&nbsp; I would update the BIOS, but cannot connect to the internet to do this.&nbsp; I have
 even run system restore, but have not resorted to system recovery yet. &nbsp;I need help!

            <p>This is a problem with the BIOS or the motherboard before Windows even starts loading. So, nothing you do to Windows will help.</p>
<p>It should be possible to create a CD on another computer to try to update the BIOS. Try to get into the BIOS and look for a reset option. Also try removing the CMOS battery from the motherboard for five minutes to see if that will reset things.</p>

    <title>NET Runtime version &#58; 2.0.50727.4253 - No debugger found.No - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewhigginsmmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            NET Runtime version &#58; 2.0.50727.4253 - No debugger found.No registered JIT debugger was specified on upgraded Servers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 5 customer servers upgraded from Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2008 R1 32 bit who started experiencing their client apps freezing, affecting all users for 30-60 seconds. After the slowness has stopped I notice that this Application error
 always occurs (which doesn't appear on the previous Server 2003 Servers) :-</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The description for Event ID 0 from source .NET Runtime cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component
 on the local computer.<br />
<br />
If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.<br />
<br />
The following information was included with the event:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
.NET Runtime version : 2.0.50727.4253 - No debugger found.No registered JIT debugger was specified.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Click on Retry to have the process wait while attaching a debugger manually.<br />
Click on Cancel to abort the JIT debug request.<br />
<br />
the message resource is present but the message is not found in the string/message table</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran the .Net Verification and Repair Tool but this application error still occurs. The 2008 Servers have .Net 1.1, 3.5 SP1 and 4.5.2 installed - the .Net versions have also bee uninstalled and reinstalled but this is still a problem. The 2003 Servers
 had .Net 2 SP2, 3.0 SP2 and .Net 3.5 SP1 installed. I've done some reading up to find that the .Net versions installed on 2008 Server should include the older versions as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2008 servers are mainly used to run MS SQL 2008 which ties in with COM+ objects to host several client apps and also has Symantec AV installed plus nearly a dozen other 3rd Party apps. Any one of the apps could be causing the issue possibly although
 I suspect my own app is causing which is written in a legacy language called Delphi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help advise how to take this issue further? I don't know if this is relevant but I don't have Visual Studio installed on the server if this is the reason for the error or lack of error details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Matthew&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System32 folder appears and STacSV error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pj6767  say:</h3>
<h2>            System32 folder appears and STacSV error</h2>
                    <p><b><span>I have two problems when my PC starts up, which I am hoping that you can help with:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b><b><span>The C:\WINDOWS\system32 folder opens by itself</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b><b><span>An error appears indicating:<span>&nbsp;
</span>STacSV Module has encountered a problem and needs to close</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>The folder opening has been there for a while.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The StacSV Module error just started yesterday, after a group of “high priority” Windows Updates were applied.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have listed them at the end of this message.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>It may or may not be relevant, but the Windows updates were applied after cleaning the PC from several infections.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Details:<span>&nbsp; </span>A rather obscene pop-up window appeared on its own in my browser earlier in the week, leading me to discover that McAfee had been disabled and the PC was infected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I downloaded and ran Microsoft Security Scanner, using the quick scan, which found and removed Win32Necurs and WINNT/NecursA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then removed and reinstalled McAfee Total Protection, ensured that it was up-to-date, and then ran a full scan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It found and removed Exploit-CVE-2012-1723.genA, ZeroAcess.hr and PWS-Zbos-FASG!… (didn’t get all of that last one noted down).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then tried to run Microsoft Updates, but got an error.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The auto-fix did not work, but the troubleshooting steps led to the discovery that some services (including Windows Update) were stopped.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once those were re-started, there was still an error, but then the auto-fix was able to correct it, and the updates were run.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A final round of scans was then run to make sure that the PC was clean:<span>&nbsp;
</span>a SpyBot full scan found 2 tracking cookies, but nothing else; another full McAfee scan did not find anything; and then the Microsoft security scanner was downloaded and run again, this time with a full scan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly, it found and removed Exploit-Java/CVE-2013-0431 and 1493.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Windows update history shows that no updates were applied (despite being configured to be automatic) between February and yesterday.
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>The computer is a Dell Dimension 9150 running Windows XP with SP3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>McAfee Total Protection and SpyBot-SD resident are currently running.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is my web surfing and entertainment PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>I keep most of my important stuff on a newer PC where the only internet sites visited are secure sites for banking, etc.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>What I see when the PC boots up is as follows:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Dell logo screen</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Windows XP logo screen<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- black screen</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Windows welcome screen</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Desktop background image appears</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- time appears in right corner of toolbar</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Icon **IDS_SYSTRAY_TOOLTIP appears in right corner of toolbar (audio control panel)</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- C:\WINDOWS\system32 folder appears on the screen (this and the above are at the same time as far as I can tell)</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Volume control icon appears in right corner of toolbar</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- Icon for McAfee Total Protection appears in right corner of toolbar</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- The boot appears to be complete and I can start working
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>- About a minute and a half later, regardless of whether I do anything or not, an error message appears indicating that: “STacSV Module has encountered a problem
 and needs to close.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are sorry for the inconvenience.”</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If I try to open the audio control panel from the icon, it does not work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This, however, is not something that normally use, and I am not really sure what it is for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can play MP3 files, and the sound is fine.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Following suggestions in another thread about the System32 folder appearing, I looked at msconfig to see what was in the startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only thing pointing to the System32 folder was CTFMON, which is a program that does exist in that folder, and that appears to be required according to Microsoft.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>In observing what happens at startup so that I could write it up, I rebooted several tines.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the one occasion where I rebooted without waiting for the STacSV error to appear, the shutdown process seemed to stall for a long time before getting to the shutdown scripts stage.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>The Windows updates that were applied were:</span></b></p>

            You've been busy.<br />
<br />
The first thing after this I would ask is how do you think McAfee is protecting your system?<br />
<br />
McAfee is a known CPU and memory hog and sometimes causes problems, so you might consider replacing it with Microsoft Security Essentials which has a smaller footprint.&nbsp; Your system will reward you with better performance.<br />
<br />
If you choose to uninstall your McAfee, be sure to use their uninstaller that you can find here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331</a><br />
<br />

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a><br />
<br />
You don't HAVE to use MSE, but you might think about it - at least temporarily since McAfee seems to have let you down.<br />
<br />
Since you have had some malware it never hurts to do this:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malware protection, do this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
Regarding your system32 folder opening, Microsoft knows why and tells you here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=170086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=170086</a><br />
<br />
Here is what Microsoft does not tell you in that article (one way to backup your registry):<br />
<br />
Before making registry changes, backup your registry with this popular free and easy to use tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
The reason your system got this way in the first place is usually due to some malicious software infections.&nbsp; It could be a current malicious software infection or residue from one that was partially removed by your current tools leaving behind bogus startup
 entries in your configuration.&nbsp; You must finish the cleanup yourself.<br />
<br />
<span>Your STacSV error</span> is coming from the audio device on your Dell, so you might need to reinstall those drivers from the Dell WWW site.&nbsp; Sounds like it is trying to startup something and some part of it is now broken even though it seems to sound
 okay.&nbsp; You might be able to disable the startup item to stop the error but that will not "fix" the real problem.<br />
<br />
If the program can't start, that could be why you can't open it from Control Panel.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what you need, do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
One of your updates was to your NVIDIA video system and it is generally never a good idea to accept any hardware drivers from MS Updates.&nbsp; MS doesn't know what the best drivers are for your system.&nbsp; It is best to decline any hardware driver updates from MS
 and tell MS Update to never offer them to you again.<br />
<br />
Even if it seems to be working, you might want to let NVIDIA take a look at your system:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would navigate to the NVIDIA website and let their online scanner take a look at your video system and see what it suggests for drivers and consider their analysis if they suggest a new driver.<br />
<br />
Here is the address to the NVIDIA page:<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
Read the directions, then click the GRAPHICS DRIVERS button to start the scan and respond in the affirmative if asked to install the plugin necessary to run the NVIDIA scan (I would not allow the installation of any Ask Toolbars, Google Toolbars, McAfee or
 other "extras") and follow their advice to download and install the latest drivers that are right for your video card.<br />

            Wow, thanks for the detailed response ElderL !<br />
<br />
Yes, McAfee has been disappointing.&nbsp; This is not the first time that I have had to clean up an infection despite having it, and I have used Malwarebytes before in that process in addition to the tools I mentioned.&nbsp; I do a lot of research of products, locations,
 etc., and I have seen things start popping up after opening a web site marked as safe from a search result set.&nbsp; I believe that the source is usually a legitimate web site that has been hacked/compromised, and somehow injects the infection as soon as it is
 accessed.<br />
<br />
Easy stuff first:&nbsp; Malwarebytes quick scan found and fixed 4 problems in the registry, listed below.&nbsp; Nothing else was found on the full scan.&nbsp; SAS found a bunch of tracking cookies on the quick scan, which were then deleted, and nothing else on the full scan.&nbsp;
 The nVidia site confirmed that I have the right driver.<br />
Registry Keys Detected: 1<br />
HKLM\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\SYSHOST32 (Trojan.Agent) -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully.<br />
Registry Values Detected: 1<br />
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\syshost32|ImagePath (Trojan.Agent) -&gt; Data: "C:\WINDOWS\Installer\{DE5A48E4-8A03-6FED-8F26-47C26EC50E29}\syshost.exe" /service -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully.<br />
Registry Data Items Detected: 2<br />
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center|AntiVirusDisableNotify (PUM.Disabled.SecurityCenter) -&gt; Bad: (1) Good: (0) -&gt; Quarantined and repaired successfully.<br />
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center|FirewallDisableNotify (PUM.Disabled.SecurityCenter)<br />
<br />
I looked at the MS KB article about the System32 folder appearing, backed up the registry, and then checked out those keys expecting to see something obvious to fix.&nbsp; The
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run </b>one looks very strange to me -- it looks like the beginning of some of the values are missing, as well as the leading quotes.&nbsp; Please see below (not sure if an image paste will work).&nbsp;
 In case it doesn't, one example is for Value_name=TrueImageMonitor.exe, Value_date=ITOR.EXE"&nbsp; What do you conclude from this ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will have a look at the audio part another night.<br />
<br />
Thanks again !<br />

            I prefer to have zero startup items, but depending on what you have installed, you could have something(s) in there.&nbsp; You are looking for one that does not make sense.&nbsp; Just take your time.<br />
<br />
These malware scanners - no single one seems to know about everything so it is prudent to do some supplemental scans with things like MBAM and SAS.&nbsp; "My McAfee says my system it clean".&nbsp; Well I would interpret that to mean that McAfee didn't find anything it
 knows about. <br />
<br />
I think TrueImageMonitor belongs to Acronis, so if you have that installed you may need it (and that is fine).<br />
<br />
After the MBAM and SAS scans you still have the annoying message?&nbsp; They are pretty good scanners but they are also thoughtful and can't do everything.<br />
<br />
You can right clisk your RUN registry key and Export it to a text file, then open that text file with something like Wordpad or Notepad, select all the txt and copy/paste it back here and somebody can take e look at it,<br />
<br />
Malware can be tricky sometimes...&nbsp; It wants you to think you have to reinstall your whole systemand that is never the case.&nbsp; If you were ever to choose to do that, then the malware wins (and they know it).&nbsp; There might not always be some cowabunga solution
 that fixes everything so you might have to look around some.<br />

<h2>            Compaq Presario V6030US laptop takes 45-60 seconds from logging in until desktop is displayed. 30 of those seconds the screen is blank.</h2>
                    Windows7 works well otherwise, except for the extremely long login time, which kind of messes up the whole experience.
<br />
<br />
During the login 'wait time' the disk light is not spinning overly much (doesn't seem to be waiting on diskio). Is there some debugging flag I can set that might tell me where all the time is being spent?<br />

            There seems to be two problems.<br />
<br />
P1: Welcome screen spins for ~30secs after login.<br />
<br />
P2: ~30secs of black screen before desktop appears. ~30secs of black screen also occurs at logout and 5-10secs of black screen before and after UAC prompt for admin password.<br />
<br />
<br />
Workarounds:<br />
<br />
WA1: This is actually happening on _both_ my Win7 Home Premium laptops (one 32bit with nVidia Go 6150, one 64bit with Intel 965) and it seems to have been triggered by, get this...,
<em>my solid color desktop background</em> (I know, I know... makes no sense). I changed the background to an image... any image, and my "Welcome" screen times are back to their original Win7RC times of ~2-3secs on both laptops<br />
<br />
WA2: I uninstalled the nVidia Go 6150 driver installed by Win7 and installed the (really) old Vista32bit nVidia Go 6150 from the vendor and the black screens are gone. There are other occasional issues with that driver, but much easier to live with than those
 long black screens.<br />
<br />
These are by no means fixes. These are workarounds . <br />

<h2>            Connecting asus sdrw-08d2s-u dvd burner to Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>After connecting a new ASUS sdrw-08d2s-u dvd burner, to Surface Pro I get error message: "USB Mass storage device is an older USB device and might not work with USB 3.0. Plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port and click next."</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the control panel I can see that the device is recognized; but it simply sits there whearling (sp?) the set up disk (start/stop) and nothing else happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one (1) USB port on the SPro. The ASUS suggests connecting with 2 USB connectors - comes supplied with a cable with 2 USBs on one end and the male connector for the ASUS. Apparently this is to supply more power to the ASUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS compatibility site says this device is compatible with Windows 8.1 which is running on my Surface pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know much about these things. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Is this USB port differential (2.0 on ASUS and 3.0 on Surface) sufficient to cause the problem?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there is a SDRW-08D3S-U - and so even to me it seems a bit obvious. But before going back to the store I thought that I would ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bob-24</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have a multi-port adapter so I can connect both USB connectors on the ASUS into the adapter which then is connected into the single USB pot on the SP.</p>

<p>It didn't sound like the multi port adapter was powered, so do try&nbsp;a powered hub, etc.</p>

            Yes it sounds like a Router or ISP problem with 4 machines. Maybe a Firewall issue? Try
<br />
disabling the firewall on one or two machines. Possibly a common antivirus issue.

<h2>            Widows 8 cannot see Homegroup</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my laptop to Widows 8 and all has worked well except that I cannot see my home group or log onto my home network. The Home network is run on a Widows 7 machine. My laptop is setup to log into a work domain named TCCserver03. For convenience,
 my home workgroup uses the same name.&nbsp; I thought it might be a issue because my laptop is set to log onto a domain. However, I just received my Microsoft Surface tablet with Windows 8 RT and it cannot see my Home group either.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the Laptop is set to login to a Domain the HomeGroup may be disabled. Check<br />
with Tech Support for the Domain. If it is disabled there is nothing you can do unless<br />
they will change the settings to allow it.<br />
<br />
If the Home Group is allowed by Tech Support (a big IF) then check the drivers and
<br />
other methods below. Also check them for the Surface runing Windows RT however<br />
you need to check in the Surface RT&nbsp;Forums.<br />

<br />
=====================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>These will NOT help if the Domain setup does not allow the Home Group.<br />
</strong><br />
Note there&nbsp;are few&nbsp;specific on-line and/or KB resources for Windows 8&nbsp;as yet&nbsp;so you<br />
may need to translate some of the Vista and Windows 7 methods. Of particular<br />
note should be using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run,<br />
and Settings as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using
<strong>Win Key</strong> <br />
toggles Desktop and Start Screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Translate these to Windows 8 methods (there is little real difference) :<br />
<br />
</strong>Both computers need to have&nbsp;unique names.<br />
<br />
Both computers need to have the same time and date.<br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security programs can block or cause networking issues.<br />
<br />
Your router and all computers must be IPv6 capable (hardware, firmware, and drivers)<br />
to use HomeGroup. Check the System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems)<br />
or the actual device makers' sites for update network drivers. Also check the router<br />
maker's site for updated firmware. Check their support and ask in their forums for any
<br />
known issues. <br />

How do I fix network adapter problems?<br />

<br />
To manual update the drivers :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's
<br />
tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh<br />
the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

<p><br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for network card</strong> (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as<br />
Windows 8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks for all of the helpful information. I never was able to get on the Homegroup but using the information provided, I was bale to get on the Home Network so who needs the Homegroup?</p>
<p>BTY it appears that a recent Microsoft update changed the name of my home network back to WORKGROUP.&nbsp; This was preventing my access to the home net, which I had incorrectly attributed to my update to Win 8. When I noticed this I asked my wife if she was
 having any problems and she reported she had not been able to access the printer - same problem she was accessing under the work group name we had given so couldn't see the primary computer on the group.</p>
<p>All is well now.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jim</p>

I still suspect the HomeGroup was disabled by the Domain IT dept.&nbsp;as that is expected.<br />

Glad to have helped. Sounds like you did some very good troubleshooting.<br />

</p><p>I have a Sony laptop, which I upgraded to Windows 10 last November which is now in self-destruct mode. I mean that every (software)&nbsp;component of my laptop is getting damaged. Firstly, the Wi-Fi component stopped working. Then I was unable to install software
 stating that some .dll files are missing (majority of them showed PSAPI.DLL). After then some software already installed (like Google Chrome, VLC Media Player, etc.) stopped opening. When connecting my phone through USB, I can't access the phone's file system
 (same thing happened when connecting my camera, it is not responding).</p>
<p>Please help me how can I get back my PC in original state. Please note that I have tried refreshing and resetting the PC, it doesn't work.</p>

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description the taskbar icons turns into blank square if that application is running. After closing that application icon reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be due to some virus/malware or if some settings of Task bar get changed. So try to follow the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a
<strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong>.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists move to method 2 and see if it works for you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists then I would suggest you to run the security software and check if your system is affected by some viruses.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persist, I would suggest you to follow the suggestion provided by
<strong>Foxprints </strong>replied on <strong>November 27, 2009 </strong>in the following thread which deals with same time type of issue you are facing.</p>

            Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I tried all of your suggestions and none work.&nbsp; I did, however, find a workaround.&nbsp; When I change the
<strong>Taskbar Buttons </strong>properties to<strong> Always Combine, Hide Labels</strong>, the problem went away.&nbsp; Any idea why this would fix this issue? I had it set to
<strong>Combine When Taskbar is Full</strong>.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround which have mentioned works because all of the items of the same folder or application get merged in one folder. So, that may be the reason that now folders are not appearing as black/blank.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue if SFC reported that it find corruption but could not fix all of them. &nbsp;It means there is some corruption remaining. Try to create new user profile as an administrator and see if it helps&nbsp;you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account
 we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span></p>

<h2>            where are windows 10 files downloading&#63;</h2>
                    Hello guys my windows update is downloading something huge.When I go to check for updates there are no updates available,so I thought it would be windows 10 files,but I didnt get notification that it is ready because I have a hardware compatibility problem(Graphic
 card).Moreover people say it is downloading in hidden folder "<em>C:\$windows.~BT" ,</em>but I didnt see such a folder after enabling "show hidden files and folders".So what is windows update downloading of huge size?

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>
<p>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<p>If it's a wired headset and out of the 90 day warranty period I would try replacing the 3.5mm headphone jack.&nbsp; We've had 3 controllers stop working with a wired headset. (all other buttons, etc. still worked)&nbsp; I replaced the 3.5mm jack and now have sound
 and mic thru the wired headset!&nbsp; You can find the part on Amazon for around $5.00 USD.&nbsp; Easy fix. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            .NET Framework 3.5 &#40;Includes .NET 2.0 &#38; 3.0&#41; Installation</h2>
                    <p>Recently I upgraded to Windows 10 some months ago. A couple days ago I downloaded and installed a game. The problem was that I couldn't open it without downloading the .NET Framework. I go to download it but everytime I try to do so an error message appears
 saying "This function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction. Error code: 0X80071A90"</p>
<p>I can't play the game without downloading the Framework. I've tried speaking to some helpers both from Microsoft and the game's company, and though they were patient, none of them really helped me with this problem.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to solve this? It's been annoying me so much. Thank you!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 keeps reloading screen after start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinatm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps reloading screen after start up</h2>
                    <p>Hope anyone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just updated HP Pavillion 23&nbsp;xi to Windows 10 and now the screen keeps reloading/refreshing after start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems absolutely fine when I start it up and have to enter my password, but once I've gone past that the screens keeps refreshing and everything seems unresponsive. I am able to do CTRL+ALT+DEL and open taskmanager but that's it.</p>
<p>Have tried restarting several times but nothing helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>After supposedly&nbsp;"successfully" installing Windows 10 two nights ago, I immediately encountered a problem experienced by many who have posted in the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A search will yield you many similar stories.&nbsp; But in an instance like yours, basically you'll find that...</p>
<ul>
<li>After sign-in (but before the boot-up appears complete), the computer just hangs there and becomes unusable and inaccessible.</li><li>The screens "flickers" (flashes) back and forth from black, to&nbsp;an empty&nbsp;desktop, to a desktop with icons, and so on all over again.</li><li>The computer seems stuck in a never-ending cycle or some unknown process.</li><li>Being able to access only the Task Manager, CPU and/or Disk usage can be witnessed running at 100% intermittently.</li></ul>
<p>Responses to these posts vary.&nbsp; Many have successfully resolved the problem.&nbsp; Other sit patiently awaiting their solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many also call for the user to enter Safe Mode.&nbsp; From there, you can choose to Troubleshoot, fix things, or simply uninstall Windows 10 altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In my case, I&nbsp;chose to the "Go Back To Previous Build" option, thinking this was the safest bet.</p>
<p>

I've had this issue for a while now and was just about to call it quits on Windows 10 as I was on the line with a Microsoft Consultant and they could not figure it out either.<br />
<br />
When I saw this message I had a look and could see iCloud being run in StartUp (Ctrl+Alt+Del, Task Manager, StartUp) and rather than uninstall, i've disabled it from starting when Windows Loads. &nbsp;To my relief, I no longer have this refreshing issue, I can also
 use the Start Button and Search box again which i haven't been able to use since the desktop was refreshing all the time.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone else in need.

    <title>How to improve Windows firewall startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siegen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to improve Windows firewall startup</h2>
                    When I start my computer (XP SP3+), it seems that the very last item to load is the Windows firewall. I get a balloon message at the bottom right of the screen that my system is unprotected because of no firewall. If I wait long enough (1-2 minutes), the
 message goes away and I check the firewall from the control panel and I find that it is "on". Seems to me that the firewall should be one of the very first things to start when the computer is booted. Is there a way to change the sequence of events at startup?<br />
<br />

            Thanks to both responders. ElderL, your description of the problem is correct, except this message sits on the screen for 1 to 2 minutes before it goes away (before the firewall turns "on"). Certainly long enough for someone less attentive than I to head
 for the Internet and get well and truly in trouble if the bad guys are around. Today (I have no explanation) Windows Firewall would not load at all. I tried several times and continued to get message that merely said that Windows could not open the Firewall.
 No reason given (go figure!). I finally rebooted and the problem continued. Finally I gave it one more try and BINGO it turned itself "on". I have no idea what was happening. To me, it seems that the very first thing I would like to load is the firewall. Certainly
 before all the other miscellaneous junk that appears in the lower right corner next to the clock. I'll have to take a look at Rohit's suggestions to see if I want to tackle this or not. Sounds scary. I have considered loading a 3rd party firewall to see if
 Windows would load it more quickly than the Windows version. I have not yet done this. I don't want to make the warning message merely go away (hide the problem). I prefer a reasonable permanent fix to get the firewall up and running in a reasonable time during
 startup.<br />

            I'm Greg, a volunteer and eight year Windows MVP who will try to help you.
<br />
<br />Have you tried uninstalling, restarting PC then reinstalling the emulator?
<br />
<br />Have you tried another one like Blue Stacks?  <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/simulation/the-sims-freeplay-on-pc.html#gref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/simulation/the-...</a>
<br />
<br />Was the Update causing the problem a Windows Update or the new Fall Creators Version update?  Check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About for the version.  
<br />
<br />If you're still on an older WIndows 10 version what I would do is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If problems persist go over this Checklist to optimize the install for upgrade: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Blue Screen &#58; DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new Asus ROG G771JW in August. Since August, when laptop charger NOT plugged-in, i get blue screen error "DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE" on some programs (AutoCAD, AutoCAD Civil 3D, Nvidia GeForce Experience etc.) I gave my laptop to Asus service
 for 3 times. And guess what, they say nothing is unusual, there isn't any hardware problem, Asus has no software support... bla bla bla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If laptop charger is plugged-in there is no problem. I can use all programs without blue screen error. This is so annoying. I can't work without charger. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded my minidump file to my OneDrive. Thank you all.</p>

            <p>Hi Kaltag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you are getting a "<strong><em>Blue Screen Error</em></strong>” on the computer. These type errors usually occurs when a serious problem causes Windows 8 to shut down or restart unexpectedly. There are multiple reasons why this type of errors
 occurs on the computer. In this case, the issue could be due to the damaged or corrupted System Files on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your
 computer." </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to resolve the issue please try below mentioned methods and see if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> </span></span><span><span><strong>Disconnect all the external devices</strong> connected to your computer except mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check the issue in <strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> and check if you are getting any error message.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link below and follow the instructions mentioned under <strong>
Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong>: </span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided by <strong>Patrick Barker </strong>
replied on <strong>December 7, 2013 </strong>in the thread mentioned below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-81-driverpowerstatefailure/bee38c92-c766-48d2-9f0d-0f76e9ad51e2"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows 8.1 - Driver_Power_State_Failure
</span></a></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If issue persists, I would suggest you to follow the suggestion provided in the following article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/resolve-windows-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Resolving Blue Screen errors in Windows</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important</strong>: </span></span></p>
<p><span>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I highly recommend <em>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</em> before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore disclaimer:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong><span>Ignore the step Reinstall Windows&nbsp;8 from the above link.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with&nbsp;the information required&nbsp;and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>The problem might lie with the battery even though it's a fairly new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can perform a quick battery test by doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and click Command Prompt.</li><li>Type (or copy/paste from here): <strong>powercfg /batteryreport </strong>and hit Enter</li></ol>
<p>The report will be saved to C:\users\username\battery-report.html (where username is whatever name you're logged onto the laptop with).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want just the standard command prompt by the way so not the one called Command Prompt (Admin).

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">I've tried running the Microsoft Fix-it app for Windows Update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That also keeps looping.<span>&nbsp; </span>It tells me there is a problem...I tell it to fix the problem...It tells me it’s fixed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But if I run it again, it just repeats.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">I've also tried restoring my system to a previous restore point, and that makes no difference.<span>&nbsp; I've also tried manually downloading
</span>KB2813170 and installing it but that makes no difference either.&nbsp; That also keeps looping.</font></font></font></p>

 a previous restore point, "Installed Updates" is always blank.&nbsp; When I last looked at "Installed Updates" about 3 weeks ago, it listed every single update I had done, as I've been in the process of reinstalling all my software on this laptop.</font></span></p>

            <p>I have same issue; however, my Microsoft Update history shows several successfull installations for the KB2813170 fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same luck with Fixit... finds an unspecified issue that is supposedly corrected, but no resolution to actual issue (in that KB2813170 is once again ready to be applied).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can't be the only two having this issue, so hopefully they will produce a better automated installer or correction for these/this issue(s).</p>

            Me too. I have been wrestling with this on and off for weeks. very frustrating. Two updates are found, this one (KB2813170)&nbsp;and IE V10. If I install KB2813170 it claims to have completed successfully, but then IE 10 fails dismally. Another scan shows the
 same updates available again. I have scoured the internet and tried every single suggestion there is, but nothing will fix it. I have also scanned for malware etc using Stopzilla, installed and scanned using&nbsp;Sophos, and nothing is found.
