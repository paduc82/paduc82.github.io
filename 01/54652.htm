    <title>Watch_Dogs data syncing error. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Watch_Dogs data syncing error.</h2>
                    
<p>So, I have been playing Watch_Dogs offline a lot on my Xbox One, and everything was going just fine until I tried to play it 2 days ago. I was on the title screen and whenever I tried to proceed into the main menu it poped up that it couldn't sync my data.
 This popes up for me all the time because I was playing the game offline, so I just clicked on the "Use offline" option, but instead of going to the main menu as it usually does, it took me back to the title screen of the game. I retried going into the game,
 resetting my Xbox One, etc, but nothing worked. I finally thought I just had to connect my Xbox One to the internet to fix the issue, so today I brought it to my aunt's house. I had to update my console, which I did successfully and I started Watch_Dogs again.
 Whenever I got into the games title screen, I pressed A as prompted to continue and it poped up, saying, "Syncing data with Watch_Dogs, we should be done in a moment." Whenever it gets to 100%, it says, "Something went wrong. Give it another try. If this happens
 again, let us know by entering 0x838601e7 at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate. I try again and again but the same error happens. Now I can't even play Watch_Dogs offline. Whenever I go to the website and enter the error code, it comes back with no
 results. I would really appreciate any help anyone can give me to fix this problem and get me back to playing.</p>

<h2>            tiworker.exe high disk usage on Windows 2012 server after todays software update</h2>
                    We restarted our 2012 server today after a windows update and the disk usage is near 100% due to tiworker.exe running. We almost cannot use the console because it is so slow. Anyone else having similar problems after this update? How long should we expect
 this to run?

    <title>Xbox insider update glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxemo bobbyxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox insider update glitch</h2>
                    The recent Xbox One Insider program update has caused a glitch/bug to the Guide tab buffer any game being played online or single player. So it goes like this: I'm playing a game and i try to open the tab to either make game clip, invite friends to party chat, or even opening messages. All my friends that are in the preview program also experience the same problem on any game. This needs to be looked into, it's getting annoying that most of the games i play suffer severely from this bug; this causes some matches in multiplayer games to lose sync and disconnects me from the lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Drive shows in explorer but not in device manager and disk management</h2>
                    Suddenly the system (c:) drive does'n show in device manager and in disk management but in exporer. Everything works well but I can't make computer backups anymore and Windows update fails (connection error, althouhg I have good connection). I've run 5
 different Trojan removers, Malware killers and run antivirus before booting. No luck. I haven't had this problem before. By the way I run Windows&nbsp;7 Ult. The only thing I've done is removing partitions from an external USB drive. And later on removed backup
 profiles grom Norton Ghost 15. When I get strange problems I always get suspicious about Symantec products because of earlier experince. Don't know if I can blame them now. Any way I've also rebuild MBR and BCD with EasyBCD. Can find some similar problems
 on the net but absolutely no solution or explanation. Have been searching for days now. Anybody any idea?

            Well finally! Suddenly I couldn't start Windows att all and was forced to do a startup repair. That solved all of my problems. It seemed to have been a rootkit error but probably not a malware or still a very much unknown. Thanks all of you for trying
 to help me!

<h3> tomcav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech 5.1 x-530 Speakers, Intel DG33TL motherboard, Windows 8.  Combination doesn&#39;t work.  Any ideas&#63;</h2>
                    I've had the pc, motherboard and speakers for several years. &nbsp;Ran it under XP, and used the IDT audio driver from Intel's site. &nbsp;All good.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Installed Windows 8 last week. &nbsp;Windows dumped the IDT audio driver and installed its own. &nbsp;Now the rear speakers don't work. &nbsp;Tried all combinations of plugs. &nbsp; Three plugs (green, red, black) and four holes (g, r, blk and blue). &nbsp;Left, right, center
 and subwoofer all worked fine (using g and r plugs / holes). &nbsp;Was able to gets Windows Audio Setup to send a test signal through the rear speakers when they were in the blue hole (the plug is black), but my media players wouldn't push sound through them (Winamp
 and WMP) regardless of where they are plugged in. &nbsp; I know the speakers work. &nbsp;It's gotta be the driver, right?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Stupidly (I guess, now that it didn't work), i tried uninstalling the drivers and rebooting (like you do on XP when something doesn't work right), figuring the plug'n'play function would reinstall the driver. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;Windows 8 can't find any audio anything
 (motherboard h/w, drivers, or speakers plugged in.) &nbsp; Intel's IDT driver doesn't work with Windows 8. &nbsp;Logitech offers no s/w on their site; they rely (probably rightly so) on the sound h/w and operating system providers to do the job.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had this problem and fixed it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good to know that you are using Windows 8.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am sorry to hear that you are facing issues with the speakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Anannya,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;The PC is not a specific brand. &nbsp;I built it from various components several years ago. &nbsp;The mother board, as I said, is an Intel DG33TL. &nbsp;Intel's site lists drivers for this board covering Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 but not 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since yesterday, I was able to get the OS to re-recognize the sound h/w on the motherboard and it reinstalled the windows audio driver (Speakers / HP IDT High Definition Audio CODEC Driver version 6.2.9200.16384). &nbsp; So, I'm back to basic sound functionality.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was also able to install the IDT control panel from Intel's site (IDT Audio Control Panel, Integrated Device Technology, Inc Version 1.0.200001.0, 2009,03.12 13:14:42) &nbsp; Also checked Integrated Device Technology, Inc's web site, but they refer you back
 to the Intel site for drivers / software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The IDT control s/w has a graphic display with three boxes and top / side menus. &nbsp;The right box correctly shows the jack configuration for my pc. &nbsp;It also recognizes all three plugs (front, center/sub, side) installed. &nbsp;But the center top box only allows
 "Stereo Speakers" to be selected for the configuration, even though 5.1 is a drop down menu option. &nbsp;Therein lies the issue. &nbsp;The Intel provided drivers apparently aren't built for Windows 8, and the Windows 8 driver that Microsoft provided doesn't recognize
 all the speakers. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's where I am. &nbsp;I'm hoping either Intel or Microsoft will update their driver s/w the the DG33TL / Windows 8 combination.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tom</div>
<div><br />

<h3> marianlabounty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with adding destination in Maps.</h2>
                    <p>New computer came with Windows 8.1 and Maps program.&nbsp; Was told Maps would/could lay out a route with multiple stops just like Streets &amp; Trips but I cannot figure out how to add more than one destination.&nbsp; No help menu.&nbsp; No tutorial.&nbsp; Nothing I can find on
 Microsoft or Bing websites to learn how to use the software so I can't even confirm Maps can be used to route out multiple stops.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I found where someone had posted a similar question in November of 2012, but no answers.&nbsp; Just 8 or 9 of us with the same question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone???&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 10 boots up with black screen with blinking cursor and then - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjshadowfade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 boots up with black screen with blinking cursor and then loads up windows like normal &#40;why is their a black screen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This PC has been working perfectly fine for a while it is a gaming PC. When I turn on the power button it boots up to a black screen for like 5 seconds then loads where I can sign in and it will load. Why is that black screen there in the first place it
 wasn't there when I bought it several months ago. From what I have gathered from research is that it could be a hard drive problem or software problem. Things I have done are set the c: hard drive first in BIOS which has windows on it. I thought it possibly
 could be a virus so I refreshed my pc and it is still doing the same thing.&nbsp; I do not know what else to do. I have tried advance trouble shooting, system restore, going into the command prompt to rebuild bios, the start up repair kit which says it couldn't
 repair, going into safe mode. Nothing has helped. Any idea what is happening?</p>

<p>Are you using the nvidia driver package or microsoft basic display drivers ? if nvidia check all the settings;</p>
<p>single display (options),vsync and vr are set to application, dsr depends on the connected monitor-display,</p>
<p>the 970 should have no issues their.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are on a uefi bios, windows boot manager needs to be the first in the boot start, then the actual drive it is on, the other devices like dvd etc.</p>
<p>What you are seeing is called fastboot, it hibernates the pc so when it is turned on, you are in windows login &nbsp;So what you are seeing is normal and not a gpu issue.</p>
<p>If you use the restart option it should go through the normal boot cycle where you see the startup menu from the bios options.</p>
<p>You can turn off these options.</p>
<p>I only have fastboot being used on 1 of 4 pc's a laptop and it has not caused any issues.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes I am using the Nvidia driver package. My bios is actually in legacy mode and the boot sequence is</p>

<p>2. My hardrive&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Usb storage device</p>
<p>I have messed with the order to see if that got rid of it but it did not. Also I do not see windows boot manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did click on uefi bios there were no options there so I couldn't use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the fastboot even when turned off, hibernation has never been on also. It still loads the black screen so that is not the cause either.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the motherboard does have uefi bios but you are using legacy mode, is this right.</p>
<p>Fastboot, hibernation, hybrid sleep, sleep are set in the power management settings of the os,</p>
<p>some options in the bios also that tell the os what the hardware can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now running the motherboard in legacy will limit some options in the os, like booting from larger than</p>
<p>2tb hard drives and other hardware.</p>
<p>Regardless of bios mode being used, having the cd/dvd drive first will make the bios look for media on the drive first, it may light a few times trying to read bootable media.</p>
<p>The c drive or uefi loader should be first.</p>
<p>After the bios checks the dvd and sees nothing it will then go to the next device in the set order and so on.</p>
<p>The bios may have a display to show post test menu so short it is not seen, this should be able to be changed.</p>
<p>How I configure my boot set is hard drives first, usb drives, dvd, portable media (thumb drives),network.</p>
<p>But if I add or remove anything from windows or the bios I go back in and remove that device, because despite what some here may say, they do interact with each other, sometimes not working in unison.</p>
<p>Was the uefi bios ever used in non legacy mode ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my 990fxa uefi mb it takes more time to see the on screen bios than my 3 other pc's running legacy bios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of diskette drive is i the system? floppy or other ?</p>

            Yes it does have uefi option, and when I click on it everything is blank. so i don't think uefi bios was used. When I try to add option a pop says warning file system not found. The c drive would be on my&nbsp;hard drive(I'm assuming so). I did try to boot
 it uefi regardless of it being blank and it didn't load anything and gave me the option to go to my bios. As far as the diskette drive I am not familiar with it, I believe it is just standard. When I look under disk drives it just shows my hard drive. my bios
 menu is the Dell OptiPlex 3010 I'm not sure if that helps. Would it help if I included pictures of my whole bios and my device manager?

<p>Diskets usually refer to drives &nbsp;floppy &nbsp;or zip drives.</p>
<p>If there is not one in the system, the option should be disabled.</p>
<p>It is not possible to switch from legacy to uefi and back by setting the bios, the boot drive
</p>
<p>has to be formated and the os installed using that method.</p>
<p>It also depends on how the boot drive is formatted, mbr for legacy non uefi bios boot drive size&nbsp;</p>
<p>only &nbsp;2tb and under, uefi over 2 tb for boot drive but must be gpt format.</p>
<p>Check in disk management for the disk layout mrb og gpt.</p>
<p>Is this the system&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check device manager for other display adapters.</p>
<p>It does not say what the power supply wattage is on it, this may be under powering the gtx 970.&nbsp;</p>

            Try Enable\Disable secure boot in your BIOS. The boot black screen is the boot loader which is normally manipulated or changed to show the manufacturers name before booting into windows.

<h2>            Two options while startup&#63;</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I had some booting problems(ON Windows 10) so I reinstalled Windows 10 on the same drive(C:,GPT) after deleting all files lying on it.<br />
After installation when my pc was starting i got two options:<br />
1.Windows 10 on 2 volume<br />
2.Windows 10<br />
I clicked on first option and my pc started well ,everything was as it should.But second time when i clicked on second option ,there was a blue screen with error message.<br />
I want to to remove second option.<br />
AN another thing is that there is no any folder named "Windows.old" everything is new.<br />
I tried System Configuration and other options but nothing worked.<br />
And there is no other drive on which i have installed a new operating system.

    <title>How to assign a drive letter permanently for an external HDD that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christy joseph  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to assign a drive letter permanently for an external HDD that doesn&#39;t change no matter where i plug into&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I would like to know if a batch file can be created or an autorun file can be created so that the drive letter remains the same no matter where i plug into. The reason behind is, i have some folder icons that change when plugged into a different system having
 a different drive getting assigned to it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thanks in Advance, </p>

            <p>Hi Christy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hook up the hard drive to your computer nr. 1</p>
<p>Go to drive management. chose a drive letter that is not used on any computer you use this drive on.</p>
<p>Do the same on the other computers. That should work. I've seen it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck.</p>

            yes thank you i knew that... but i wanted it to remain the same for unknown computers too... is there any way to give a relative path or to automatically detect the drive letter so that the folder icons doesnt change for different drive letter...

            If you were to somehow set it a fixed drive letter... what do you think will happen when you plug it into another computer that already has that drive letter assigned to another drive, perhaps a&nbsp;sleeping drive.

            <p>This is why I wrote that instruction, it wil screw up the computer you hook it up to when your chosen drive letter is the same as an existing one. So if you want to hook it up to any computer chose a letter that never gets used, and you can't be sure of
 that! Sorry</p>

<p>I have two USB&nbsp;Sandisk flash devices - one long auto-assigned "F": &amp; one, "G:". Look at them now...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/253f27ac-55c0-446e-851c-a0f0063b77a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/253f27ac-55c0-446e-851c-a0f0063b77a1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That's after...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Reassigning "G:" to the "F:" &amp; unplugging it.</p>
<p>(b) Plugging in the original "G:".</p>
<p>(c) Plugging in the new "G:".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it grabbed the first available letter for it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it skipped "D:", which is my DVD.&nbsp;And it skipped "B:", which may be for a possible RAM drive. But "B:" is actually in the list...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>But I'm very pleased with this outcome. MSFT did a fine job with that.</p>
