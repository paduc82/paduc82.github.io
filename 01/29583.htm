    <title>Lockscreen stuck on Windows Spotlight and it will not change off of it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lockscreen stuck on Windows Spotlight and it will not change off of it on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Windows 10</p>
<p>I have had this issue since around the time Windows 10 was released and Microsoft answer desk tech support is useless as they are unable to fix my problem that I have. I hope someone out there has experienced the same problem and is able to help me fix it.
 My lock screen is stuck on Windows Spotlight and it will not change off of it. I want it changed to a picture lock screen background but, I am unable to do that since it is stuck on the Windows spotlight lock screen. The options I have for the lock screen
 are the options for the slideshow lock screen option and it is set on windows spotlight and I am UNABLE to change it off of that. Whenever I try to it always just jumps back to windows spotlight and won't stay set. The weird part is that it is only on one
 user account, all of my other user accounts are unaffected. I have tried everything and can not fix it and Microsoft have tried and thought they fixed it but really they didn't they just claimed they did. They won't even admit to their windows 10 being flawed
 and having bugs in it which is sad. I really hope one of you guys out there can help me with this problem.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, thanks but unfortunately, I don't have any restore points that are from before this issue happened since it has been going on now for a while, like over a year. I wish I thought about that before whenever this issue first started but unfortunately,
 it is too late for me to use system restore as it will not really be any help. One solution that I thought about was transferring everything from this user account to another but, I don't exactly know how to do except by moving everything onto an external
 drive and putting it on my new user account which will be very time consuming so, I would rather see if I can get this issue fixed without having to do that.

<h2>            How to exit OOBE</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was just checking out my Windows folder (for a certain DLL file), I came across<br />
a folder named 'oobe', and I opened it. There was this file (either oobe.exe or msoobe.exe, I really don't remember) and I obviously opened it. Thing is, it won't close (even after restarting 😐). Any help? This is Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 16XXX (can't
 remember lol, but definitely with the Microsoft Edge epub support). I tried pressing Win + X and clicking Desktop. No luck... I tried opening PowerShell as an administrator, but the window isn't showing up. I typed the command anyway:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop-Process -processname "oobe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And pressed enter. Didn't work. Help. S.O.S.</p>

                    Hello.&nbsp; I have a valid 25 character product key for Windows Vista - But not sure which version.<br />
I wanting to reinstall a laptop but the license sticker under the laptop is very "smudged" I can only see the 25 character product key and the words "Windows Vista XXXX"&nbsp; but not sure if its Home, Business or Ultimate.<br />
<br />
Is there a website/link I can put my product key in, then they can tell me what version I'm licensed for?<br />
P.S. Someone formatted the laptop to test to try Windows 7,,, so thats why I don't know what version I'm licensed for.<br />

    <title>Why Does The One Only Have A 350GB Hard Drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azrael008uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Does The One Only Have A 350GB Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>They knew that 150GB would be needed for the OS.</p>
<p>They knew that Next Gen games would be clocking 20 - 40GB in size.</p>
<p>At 350GB my One HD only has 30GB more space than my 360 (GOW 320GB edition).</p>
<p>I know we've been told that we can install external HD's but at £80 - £120 for a 3 - 4TB external drive &nbsp;console maintenance costs are soaring.</p>
<p>I'm glad I can add the extra storage space but knowing what they knew about the OS and game size how could a 350GB HD ever have been considered "Fit for purpose"?</p>

 your problem, not MS's. The listed capacity is the capacity of the drive, same as if one bought a phone or a PC or a tablet. Rarely does one have access to all the space on a device. Rarely does a device report the same space available as listed on advertising

<h2>            Join SCCM 2012 R2 Primary site to Pre-existing SCCM 2012 R2 CAS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer who is planning to install in his office in El Salvador one SCCM 2012 R2 server as the primary site .</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new server then want to attach to the hierarchy that already have installed in Spain , which have a SCCM 2012 R2 server with the CAS role .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The domains between the two offices are different forests , are working on enabling communication between the two offices using trust relationships in Active Directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question I have is , if we can install the SCCM primary site and eventually join it to the existing CAS server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried many ways using <strong>cmd</strong> and <strong>chkdsk/Diskpart&nbsp;</strong>in<strong> Administrator mode</strong> to recover and format these RAW files/partition from the SD card.</p>
<p>However, whatever way I try, I always get Windows 10 telling me either...</p>

<p>chkdsk is not available for RAW drives</p>
<p>windows 10 is unable to format this drive etc,etc,</p>

<p>Hi StrainedVase852,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a drive is in RAW status, it means that the drive is not ready to be explored or accessed by the operating system.&nbsp;To save the data on the RAW drive, you can first recover them with the free data recovery software on the market. However, if there's
 no important data on the drive, you may proceed with converting the RAW drive in another way (<em>Since convert is a command that does not work on RAW drive, you need to turn to another command, format.)</em>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <em>command prompt</em> in the search box, right-click the best match and run it as administrator.</li><li>Type the following the hit <strong>Enter</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>format F: /fs:fat32&nbsp;</strong><em>(<strong>Note:</strong> F is the drive letter of the RAW drive)</em></li><li>Press <strong>Enter </strong>again. </li><li>Specify the partition label if you want to. It takes around twenty minutes to format a 32GB SD card.</li><li>Exit command prompt.</li></ol>
<p><em><br />
</em>Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good Day Aileen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your expert advice.</p>
<p>I did as instructed and all was going very well.....</p>
<p>until the very end of the format process!!!</p>
<p>This is what the result was.....</p>
<p><strong>invalid media or track 0 bad - disk unusable.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean exactly that, that the SD card is no longer usable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your thoughts please.</p>
<p>

<p>After unsuccessfully trying to format this card. I thought as it is in 2 partitions recognised as...</p>
<p><strong>F:</strong> 16MB</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> 29.7GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that maybe the partition <strong>F:</strong> being possibly the actual file system to operate the SD card must need to be formatted first!?</p>
<p>So I ran on<strong> cmd</strong> in <strong>Admistrator mode</strong>, this...</p>
<p><strong>format F:/fs:fat32</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>But it came back saying...</p>
<p><strong>The volume is too small for FAT32</strong></p>
<p><strong>Format failed.</strong></p>
<p>SO i tried again using NTFS instead and this was the result...</p>
<p><strong>The type of File system is RAW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The new file system is NTFS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Verifying 16.0MB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Volume Label (32 characters, ENTER for none)?</strong></p>
<p>At this point I was a little stumped not knowing what this was actually meaning!?</p>
<p>So I just typed in <strong>ENTER</strong> and then this happened...</p>
<p><strong>Creating file system structures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Format complete.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>16.0 MB total disk space.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>13.8 MB are available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Format failed.</strong></p>
<p>SO I am now back to the start, still unable to format this SD card???????????</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. If Windows is unable to format the drive, the next best course of action is to use a third party or free RAW SD card format software or partition software available online. If you are to use a free software to format drives, you might
 be asked to download a tool which is normally supported in Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            I like Windows 8 just fine.&nbsp; What I don't like is the fact Microsoft doesn't support its older products [such as&nbsp;CFS 2 and 3]&nbsp;with the new OS Windows 8.&nbsp; Get with the program Microsoft, &nbsp;and provide us with&nbsp;access to&nbsp;some great games that have your name

<p>When you run the Windows 8.1 "Program Compatibility Troubleshooter"&nbsp; you indicate that CFS3 ran well with Windows XP SP3.&nbsp; You eventually get an error message that says CFS3 is an&nbsp; "Incompatible Program".&nbsp; The bottom line is Windows 8.1 will run CFS3 some
 times, but not at all times.</p>

            I have windows 8.1 also I have CFS2 and 3.&nbsp; If you will right click on the icon then click on ' troubleshoot compatibility', it will put you in a screen to auto test it and adjust&nbsp;and&nbsp;save&nbsp;settings so that whenever you start it, it automatically runs in
 that 'xp' mode.&nbsp;It is as they say incompatible with 8.1 so run it in <em>compatibility mode</em> and it works good as if you had XP.

<h2>            Xbox One and Comcast XG1-A Cable Box not allowing OneGuide to work</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xb1er's,</p>

<p>I just got Comcast Cables new XG1-A Cable Box installed today and it is working fine with watching TV but the OneGuide and Voice commands are not recognized. I tried automatically setting it up but the commands didn't work. Only the XG1-P is showing up in
 devices. Here are my specs.</p>

<p>Comcast Cable East Coast XG1-A Reciever. Model Number: MX011ANM</p>
<p><br />
I am guessing that Xbox just hasn't come out with a software update to work with this cable box. I maybe wrong though. PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
<p><br />
Peace</p>

<p>In addition to what Hermes suggested, I think the XG1 box is also called the "X1", correct?</p>
<p>Have you tried make=Comcast, model=X1?</p>
<p>In our April update, we have a new device DB, so if you run through setup again with make=Comcast, things should be easier to set up.</p>

<p>Hello, not sure what I'm doing wrong bit can't get this to work! The Oneguide shows up gone, but I can't change the channel. I've tried just about everything and not sure what else to try. Using XG1A (Code 1982), IR cable and Dynex dxpdp4209 (code 2042)
 I've tried all these suggestions and a few others in some other parts of these forums. I'm at a loss on why this won't work.</p>

<p>rjb89, that is very strange. C1982 is literally the only codeset that controls the X1 (aka XG1A) and is captured directly from the XR2 remote.</p>
<p>Are you sure the IR extension cable is in the correct location? Does the XR2 remote work fine?</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />
<br />Method 1.
<br />Run the Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />  
<br />1.Download the ﻿Windows Update Troubleshooter, and then select Open or Save in the pop-up window:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a>
<br />
<br />Notes
<br />	• If the pop-up doesn’t come up, you might have a pop-up blocker on. If you’re using Microsoft Edge, instructions for disabling the pop-up blocker are here. For Internet Explorer, instructions are here. If you are using a different browser or separate pop-up blocker, check the website of the browser or blocker’s manufacturer.
<br />	• If you select Save, you need to go to the folder where the troubleshooter is downloaded to after the download is complete, and then double-click the latest wu.diagcab file to run the troubleshooter.
<br />	
<br />2.Select Next and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update .
<br /> 
<br />Method 2.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent Servicing Stack Update (SSU)
<br />
<br />Determine whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:
<br />	1. From Start, choose Settings.
<br />	2. Select System.
<br />	3. Click About.
<br />	4. Scroll down to System type.
<br />Download the version of the latest SSU (KB4456655) that matches your version of Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog. 
<br />Restart your device and check for updates.
<br />Did this resolve the issue?
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent KB
<br />
<br />	1. Go to the Update history page. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/window...</a>
<br />	2. Find the most recent update KB for the version of Windows 10 you have – it’s usually at the top of the list – and either write the KB number down or copy it.
<br />	3. Go to the Microsoft Update site and search for the KB number. <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Hom...</a>
<br />	4. Select the link for the download, and then choose Download. Select Save if you are prompted. 
<br />	5. When the download completes, select Open to start the update.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4.
<br />
<br />Fix Windows file corruption
<br />
<br />Important
<br />You need to run both the DISM and SFC commands shown below, not just one of them.
<br />	1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow or Yes.
<br />	2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.
<br />	DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	3. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />	sfc /scannow
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	4. Close the command prompt, and then run Windows Update again.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 5.
<br />Perform an in-place upgrade
<br />
<br />Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> and use it to perform an “in-place upgrade” of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren’t sure. <a href="https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall</a>

<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            How long have you left it? I’ve known downloads appear to stick either at 0% downloading or installing then suddenly they’ll jump to 100% &amp; finish.
<br />You could repair Windows which would also update the PC to 1809.
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then you can try an in place upgrade repair:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1809.

            Thanks.&nbsp; By going off-line and running ccleaner and registry cleaner managed to get rid of update 1809 and unblock Windows update.&nbsp; All the other installs went through and I am back on update 1803 with no attempt by Windows update to download or install
 update 1809.

            After looking at all the answers here I went a different route.&nbsp; I simply let it run (stuck on download - 100%) while I left home.&nbsp; It took about four hours but when I returned the Status was Installing - 33%.&nbsp; If you have the time just let it run.

                    <p>Yesterday, we unplugged my Xbox and today, when we plugged it back in, it turned on but wouldn't connect to the TV. I tried all suggested resets by Microsoft, didn't work. I've tried other HDMI cables, still didn't work. Wiggled the cable around a bit, didn't work! As said, the Xbox turns on and the TV is&nbsp;fine, but it simply won't connect.</p><p>And yes,&nbsp; I tried other TVs, it didn't work either.<br /></p>

    <title>Cannot print JPG files using Windows MS Office PhotoViewer and Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farywalker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot print JPG files using Windows MS Office PhotoViewer and Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to print a photo (JPG or JPEG file) using&nbsp;MS Office 10 Photoviewer and Windows 7. I have followed&nbsp;the instructions under "How to print a picture" The picture is able to be viewed in the wizard but it prints a blank page. I can print the photo
 using Canon's Zoom browser. I have a&nbsp;HP Color LaserJet CP3505dn.&nbsp; All other printing works fine. PDF files print perfectly as do Word and Publisher files. It is only when I try to print using MS Office Photoviewer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searced the web for a solution and cannot find one. Other forums say this is a Windows 7 bug but surely it would have been fixed by now.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 32 Bit and MS Office 10. This problem is a huge inconvenience and I would request a solution from Microsoft as a matter of urgency.</p>

            You will need to contact the hardware vendor to get your mouse replaced.
<br />However,  there is a setting that automatically sends your mouse to boxes.
<br />Go to search and type mouse and open the mouse settings.
<br />Then top right click "Additional mouse options"
<br />Click the Pointer options  tab.
<br />Make sure there is NO checkmark for Snap To setting.
<br />
<br />Also if this is a bluetooth mouse make sure the device is charged.

The issue is explained by Steinberg, here:</span><br />

            Exactly what version of Windows 10?
<br />
<br />You are talking about some serious processing. It's only been the last year or two that you could get that many threads in a box less than server. 
<br />
<br />Why, because consumer Windows is intentionally not designed to handle that sort of multi-threaded loads.  Consumer Windows (Home) has always had relatively low upper resource limites. At the very least you would have to go to Win Pro or Enterprise to extend that limit, maybe even Win Server. Or do a retrograde upgrade to Win 8.  But I would be surprised if it can handle more threads than Win 10.  You should post a reply on that site to find out exactly which Win 8.1 he was talking about. 
<br />
<br />This page only talks about the RAM limits, I'm guessing/assuming that cpu core and thread count support would have a similar ramp up in the limites supported.  Look at how the RAM support jumps up. From Win Home to Pro / Enterprise is 16 times higher, then Pro to Server another 12 times higher:  128GB to 2TB to 24TB

<br />
<br />I found this answer posted July 2015
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br />Windows 10 supports maximum memory configurations that were formerly available only in the realm of servers. Windows 10 Home supports up to 128GB of RAM on the x64 platform. Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise both support up to 512GB on the x64 platform. The x86 versions of Windows 10 support a maximum of 4GB of RAM. Windows 10 supports a maximum of two physical CPUs, but the number of logical processors or cores varies based on the processor architecture. A maximum of 32 cores is supported in 32-bit versions of Windows 8, whereas up to 256 cores are supported in the 64-bit versions.

<p>Rohn007, all versions of Windows 10 appear to be affected and, unfortunately, your response is completely off topic. You may find useful to read Steinberg's article more carefully.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows 10 for Workstations but it doesn't make any difference with regards to the limitation identified by Steinberg.

<p>Steinberg is working on a long-term solution for this that involves changing their code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, they have access to a registry work-around that we provided to them last year. They are able to share this with their customers as-needed. It's not something we share publicly because there are system-wide performance implications to just picking
 a random large number for the process cap.</p>

<p>Me too , It has been 2 months struggling with the issue .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audio Performance seems show the poor activity . Spike , Peak . Really stressfull moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only big question is , what will be the future of DAW like Cubase to deal with the issue .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile VSTi , are&nbsp; getting more and more hungry of CPU . Cross finger. Imagine , Multis , Heavy sampling stuffs , all those&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful heavy weight sound like Orchestra Tools , 8 Dio , Spit fire , and super Omnisphere multis plus more more fine VSTi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering in final decision to downgrade to win 8.1 but , does anybody know how many threads release in priority bases?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlikely , such a wasting effort to buy 10 - 14 core , I 9 , giving an unsatisfactory audio performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like I mention above, Steinberg have access to both our recommended practices as well as an interim workaround that doesn't limit your cores or in any way cut down performance for DAW use. Their support should be willing to provide you with the value appropriate
 to your software and system setup.</p>

<p>I Spoke to Steinberg Distributor who has been so helpful and active .&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they / Steinberg gave me the link as i mention above .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which did not change any better .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I follow the suggestion to add Audio engine.property&nbsp; , limit to 14 only as Windows requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do MMCSS-test and everytime come up with priority 32 and 96 failed out of 128 thread, no change before and after follow Steinberg procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing i dont follow is the option to downgrade to win 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is gonna take some time to re work everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I let Microsoft to do a remote MMCS resetting yesterday for AUdio / Pro Audio aspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an obvious CPU usage increase almost 50 - 70 % from previous condition but to my regret ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>No audio Performance has given any positive improve. Same thing. Spike , PEak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AFAIK, there is no need to limit the to 14. That audioengine.property stuff is what they were using before we provided them with better information. Similarly, you don't need to downgrade to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you speak to Steinberg directly, through their support, they should be able to calculate the right number for your PC and software and give you the registry entry to set a more appropriate MMCSS cap.</p>

<p>Thanks Pete ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am focussing to what Steinberg may react to this .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just dont understand why they give such not&nbsp; updated method to solve thousands maybe more&nbsp; of Win 10 - cubase 9.5&nbsp; pro users,
</p>
<p>which I am sure got the same issue as mine. Wake up Steinberg and be aware of customers issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine , I use Steinberg since ATARI computer era man. So Dont sleep</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the limit MMCSS in&nbsp; Win 10 ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>even if WIn 10 limit 32 Threads / 96 Failed in MMCSS , does it mean 32 Threads equal to 16 cores ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is the max numbers of cores usage in the market now ?</p>

<div>Hi SJ24,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting. You may try to check via creating a new Voice Routing Policy with several PSTN Usages then assigned to the user and also Allow Private Calling is enabled at the tenant level for Microsoft Teams. See under
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/direct-routing-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Voice routing considerations</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: Direct Routing only routes calls to and from users if they use the Teams client. If your organization only uses Teams, setting "Teams Only" mode in upgrade policy is recommended.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Moreover, please make sure that your SBC has configured as recommended by your SBC vendor (Ribbon Communications). You may contact vendor support for further troubleshooting. Refer to the article under
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/direct-routing-configure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ribbon Communications deployment documentation</a></div>

            <p>Hey B.C.C.A,<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the issue is related to the game - I was actually playing it yesterday with no such issues. Though, perhaps we've differed on our settings and/or maybe your computer eventually overheated to the point where it had to shut down - I had would have
 some throttling for a little bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the general, "have&nbsp;you installed all available updates", a few notes:<br />
<br />
- I had to manually update the NVIDIA driver after the latest firmware patch by going in to the device manager, right clicking on it, and telling it to update. The firmware didn't automatically update the driver for me.
</p>
<p>- You can do a general reinstall of the drivers via this page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497
</p>
<p>- Download the .msi from above and let it run, and it will update things as needed. Though the publish date is before the latest firmware, it might still be alright to run and let it see if it finds any issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A tip on&nbsp;the game&nbsp;settings from personal experience: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Make sure you use "exclusive fullscreen". The reason is:&nbsp;Rise of the Tomb Raider's "fullscreen" mode really runs a borderless window. This means that, even if you change the resolution for the game, it will still technically be running at 3000x2000 resolution
 because the window is taking of the full screen of the laptop&nbsp;and the laptop monitor is still at the default resolution. You notice because the Steam overlay will be really tiny and your framerate will be taking a hit.
</p>
<p>- When you use&nbsp;"exclusive fullscreen", it acts like we expect "fullscreen" to and when you change the resolution it will actually change the monitor resolution.
</p>
<p>- I was having some issues with framerate before I did that and after making that change there were massive improvements.
<br />
<br />
In case you are interested, these are my settings (which is very playable). <strong>
Ignore the Intel graphics as the graphics adapter, not sure why my NVIDIA GPU decided to not show&nbsp;up today - definitely use the NVIDIA GPU.</strong></p>
<p>If you have different settings that still run at decent clip, let me know!
</p>

            Thanks for the tips Andrew. I'm certain it's not the game's fault. The Surface Book is terrible. Or at least 75% of them are...&nbsp;This is the 3rd one I've had and it'll do this with or without playing the game. Guess I have to try&nbsp;returning it for a 4th.
 I'm just so sick of deleting and re-installing everything again and again. ARRRGH! So frustrating!

            I sympathies with you, as I also experience the BSD multiple times a day.&nbsp;But why would you keep exchanging the equipment when it isn't a hardware issue&nbsp;and most likely&nbsp;software/firmware? All you are doing is wasting your time...

<p>BSODs tend to be hardware issues, not software. Each device I've swapped has gotten BSODs, but all have been different errors. This is the first time I've seen this one. As this issue is not one of the ones Microsoft has acknowledged, it's clear there is
 no software fix in sight... Even if it does turn out to be software, they haven't even gotten to the issues they HAVE acknowledged yet, so I'll be waiting years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This, combined with their statement that the issues only affect "a small number of customers", and the feedback in forums from some users who report no problems at all,&nbsp;gives me hope that there are indeed some Surface Books out there that work properly (even
 if it's the minority of them). So, I'd rather swap it out in hopes of getting one of the Unicorn Surface Books that work properly, than suffer through these bugs for the next dozen months waiting for a mythical software patch for a problem Microsoft doesn't
 even acknowledge they have.</p>
