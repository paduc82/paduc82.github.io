<h2>            Xbox One freezes when joining party chat</h2>
                    
<p>My son has been experiencing this problem whenever he tries joining one of his friends' parties. The little tab comes from the left of the screen, but then it stays there and we can't get it to go away without shutting down and restarting the Xbox One. Anyone
 know whats causing this??</p>

<h2>            Task Bar Icons Turn Orange and Blink - Apps Lock up</h2>
                    Brand new computer but have been using Windows 10 for awhile. &nbsp;My active task bar icons randomly turn orange and blink. &nbsp;The associated apps lock up. &nbsp;This seems to happen randomly when using Alt + Tab to toggle between windows. &nbsp;I can't seem to find much
 out there about this. &nbsp;I have to enter task manager and end processes. &nbsp;Not fun when you are an accountant and have to close down work (AT TAX TIME!)

            <p>Thank you Ramon-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this issue does happen to all the icons of running applications on my task bar. &nbsp;However, they don't don't all blink at once. &nbsp;Once they begin to blink, I do not have access to the application. &nbsp;I can wait a bit and they will randomly stop blinking.
 &nbsp;If I click on one that stops blinking, it turns orange, blinks, and locks up again. &nbsp;Also, when this occurs, everything lock up. &nbsp;My desktop icons...everything. Seems to happen especially when I am moving between screens with the Alt + Tab key. &nbsp;The only
 way to unlock is ending tasks with Task Manager. &nbsp;I have restarted the computer and shut down the computer. &nbsp;Windows is updated. &nbsp;I made not changes to the computer before the problem started. &nbsp;I have found little to nothing on this phenom except a couple
 of ideas that required messing with the registry. &nbsp;Decided to try here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is brand new on January 1, 2017 but I was having the same experience with my last laptop. &nbsp;I upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7 with that one. &nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Just select a different storage device when first starting the game. Then, play 1 private match and allow the data to save, and since you selected a different device, it will create another copy of your player data.</p>

<p>^^^Maybe I'm cofused, but if you pick a different storage device (i.e. flash drive/etc) How is it going to load your game in the first place?</p>
<p>I use the HD to save to, so how would I go about loading the game from the HD and then saving to another source of memory? (flash drive, usb drive, cloud, etc...) if I originally loaded the original game from the HD?</p>
<p>Or are you saying this just makes a copy from the Gears servers to your flash/usb/etc. if you chose to save to something else then where your original save is?</p>

<p>Here's a short guide on how to backup your data to the cloud.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/839288-UPDATED-AGAIN-What-to-do-if-your-rank-is-reset-amp-how-to-backup-your-data%21%21%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a>]</p>

<p><span><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">HOW TO BACK UP YOUR DATA:</span></span></b></span><br />
<br />
I have made a tutorial video showing exactly how to make a backup of your player data and campaign saves files. The video shows how to do a backup using the cloud, however the exact same method can be used to make a USB or memory card backup. If you have access
 to a USB or memory card then feel free to use one instead of, or as well as the cloud. You can never have too many backups!
<b>PLEASE read the following information before watching the video.</b><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">1.</span></b> Once you have followed the instructions in the video to make your backup files, do not continue playing from your backup drive. This is because player data files become corrupted while you are USING them. So if you
 continue to play after making your backup, your backup files could become corrupted without you knowing. Then when you need them to recover your rank they won't work, and your data will be lost. This has already happened to a couple of people, so you should
 only use your backup drive when you are updating your backup or recovering your rank. The key is to use the backup file as little as possible to prevent any data loss.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">2.</span></b> If you would like to use a USB as your backup drive, you can use any USB drive to backup your data but it will need to be formatted first for use with the Xbox. Formatting will wipe anything that is currently stored
 on the USB. I have also been told that some older USB drives are unable to be formatted and are therefore incompatible. To format your USB drive for use simply plug it into your Xbox, then go into your system settings and then storage. Click on the USB drive
 and choose "configure now". There is some more info about USB compatibility and formatting
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-360/how-to/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> on the official Xbox website. There is also a video showing exactly how to do it
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLoaMzG9Hi4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/cLoaMzG9Hi4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/cLoaMzG9Hi4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>. Many thanks to DarkHorseDre for the links!<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">3.</span></b> Many people have made comments suggesting that the cloud will sync backup player data stored there with your player data on your hard drive. So that, if your player data on your hard drive was corrupted then the
 backup data in the cloud would sync and be corrupted too. This is <b>incorrect</b> however. The cloud ONLY syncs with the local cache that it uses on your hard drive, and not with any of your game saves. They are completely independent. Cloud backups function
 exactly like a USB or memory card backup, except that they are stored online.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">BACKUP TUTORIAL VIDEO:</span></span></span></b><br />
<br />
<b>The video showing how to make a backup is available </b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F6ODna_PuM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">HERE.</span></b></a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/5F6ODna_PuM?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/5F6ODna_PuM?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> The exact backup method shown in this video also works for backing up to USB

<p>LordBaneJ's info isn't helpful for this particular problem. I have the same problem as DreadShock. He wasn't doing anything wrong, it's just that CERTAIN GAMES will NOT ALLOW you to make a copy. Dark Souls is one example.
</p>
<p>To make a back up copy, you have to MOVE (XBox will not allow "copy") the game save onto a USB drive. Then plug the USB drive into your computer and make a copy of everything manually. (Extra file will be stored on computer, etc) (May need to reveal hidden
 files, etc) Then put the USB drive back into your XBox and either 1. play the game from the USB drive, or 2. move the game back to your hardrive.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, continue praying that nothing weird happens while you are moving this single little game save file around or else everything you just tried to protect against will end up killing your hopes and dreams. Dark Souls has no pity for your attempts
 to prevent character death NOR save file death!</p>

            Windows 10 Mail app. It is not on a private domain. I have made no changes to the PC other than automatic updates from Microsoft. The only troubleshooting I've conducted is a web search, which resulted in the post I made on this website.

<h2>            How to stop auto play videos on websites in Edge</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a Lenovo laptop with Windows 10 and Edge. I was under the impression that I could easily stop the annoying auto play videos on websites but I cannot figure out how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen posts about Internet Explorer and Active X but that doesn't seem to apply to Edge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thnaks for your interest and suggestion.</p>
<p>I ran the tool, and it came back with 'windows resource....cannot find any intergrity violations'., hence no file to action that cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>I rebooted following this, and unfortuntely the panel is still blank (again tested firstly by opening a couple of programs, as I did previously).</p>
<p>The sfcdetails file remains on my desktop.</p>
<p>I would welcome any further comment, advise or suggestion.</p>

<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click radio button for <b>
Show hidden files, folders, or&nbsp;drives.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now go to the following location and check if there any files and folders.</span></p>
<p><b><span>C:\ ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In this location you will have all the programs that would appear in the start menu.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you would like to add some programs in the start menu, try adding the shortcut of the program to this folder
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above method fails, then try creating a new user account and check.</span></p>

            <p>HI Kevin, Thanks so much for your interest and suggestions. </p>
<p>Firstly, perhaps I havent been clear in clarifiying the problem/issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for allowing me to clarify this (it may also change the direction of suggested fix attempts).</p>
<p>I can see all programs that is suggested in the 'programdata' url (?)&nbsp;as mentioned by Kevin (above), by cllicking on 'all programs' wording in the start menu. However the wording 'all programs' is all i can see on the LHS, the rest is blank (above it), where
 you would have (in xp for example) pinned programs to the start menu, or seen most recent or repeatedly used programs.</p>
<p>Hence my mention above of testing changes by opening and&nbsp;closing programs, to see if they are listed.</p>
<p>Secondly I would like to determine (dont think this is too much to hope for) whether my current profile is corrupt, before fixing it with a tool (unless this is 100% safe from unexpected changes), and or creating a new account and moving everything.</p>
<p>My computer has Nortons Internet security (up to date and full and deep scans regularly run), I also run Malwarebytes at least weekly, and every couple of weeks mcafee's stinger (just to be sure)...accordingly unless anyone can see a hole in all three's
 approach, I doubt if it virus or bug related....happy to test with any other suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there another tool perhaps like the system file checker mentioned above by Rob C that could determine the sttaus of the profile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate all input and ongoing advise, as it would be great to get this sorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've never had this blue screen problem before. However I fixed the WHEA UNCORRECTABLE ERROR yesterday by not overclocking my computer in the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I've gotten a new error. I get the same blue screen with the CLOCK WATCHDOG TIMEOUT error. I've read that this can be caused by quite a few different things but I was told that the mini dump contains specific information that someone here at Microsoft
 might be able to diagnose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response which so far I believe has been helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's too soon to say but I've restored by BIOS settings to default and things seem to be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning however when I turned on my computer I got all sorts of blue screen errors including:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA (win32.sys)</p>
<p>- CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT</p>
<p>- WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was very scary because they all happened very quickly after launching windows. Everytime I would reboot I would get a different error. After setting BIOS settings to defaults it seems to have calmed down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will take a look at the other suggestions you offered today or throughout the week and will let you know how things go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate it, thank you!</p>

<h2>            Video call</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when my friend calls me on a video chat, I click on the green handset that comes up but I can only see myself on the screen, I can hear my friend but can only see her photo in the top right hand of the screen. She says she can see and hear
 me. This has only just started happening. What am I&nbsp;doing/ or not doing? just talk me through what I do when she calls me. I have never had problems like this before, is it the new version of Skype that has caused this? I am a technophobe so need to be shown
 in simple screen shots please. Tried to have an online chat but as soon as I start writing my question I get a message that Microsoft is not responding</p>
<p>Thankyou </p>

            Hi monica2212
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Why XboxOne takes forever to install&#63; Is it normal&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>my xbox one takes approximately 3 to 4 days to download/install a game demo. Is this normal or is it that my x1 is defective? Please help!!!! And also today it all in a sudden it doesn't hear my voice command any more. When I say "Xbox" it doesn't show those
 green letter so could some one help please?</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>1) Why does it take so long to install a game demo. (3 to 4 days approximately)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Why doesn't it recognize/hear my command anymore? What do I do to get it hear me again?</strong></p>

<p>If you're installing games from a disc it shouldn't take anywhere near that amount of time. If you are downloading games from the online store, that depends on your internet speed and/or network configuration.
</p>
<p>Not sure what to tell you about it not recognizing your voice, other than to reboot the system by unplugging it from the power outlet and wait about 30 secs and then plug it back and power it back on.

<p>thanks Soaked1nBleach! followed your advice, unplugged the power outlet 30s plug it back and power on. Now it works fine recognizing my voice perfectly. Thanks. &nbsp;About installing demo from the online store. From reading your reply I guess it's probably my
 internet speed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Question, could I configure my internet speed to go faster from my X1 or do I have to call the cable company for that?</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I am sorry not to bring good news here. Unfortunately no. As per Microsoft: "Skype Numbers and subscriptions are associated with the Skype account used to make the original purchase. Therefore, it's not possible to transfer these from one Skype account to another.

<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it. If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.

    <title>Problem with Upgrade Windows 10 Home to Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Upgrade Windows 10 Home to Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Laptop (Dell XPS 15 9560) that came pre-installed with Win 10 Home (activated). I wanted to upgrade to Win 10 Pro for several reasons, so I bought a license key from a 3rd party site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to change the product key (Update/Security - Activation - Change Product Key), it was rejected the first time but seemed to work when I tried the second time (as suggested by the error message): Some download took place, the Computer rebooted,
 I thought everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked back after the reboot, I found that the edition I'm on is still an activated Win 10 Home though, no change whatsoever. It still seems to utilize the original product key as well. When I now try to use the new product key, I get the following
 error message ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product key you entered did not work. Check the product key and try again or enter a different one (0xc004f050)</p>
<p>
</p><p>... which is the same as in the beginning (before the reboot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked around and tried several things that were suggested online (like using a generic key for the upgrade to pro &amp; activate with my key later), but none of those had the effect I was hoping for - I always end up with generic errors &amp; am still stuck with
 Win 10 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what I could try would be appreciated ... thanks in advance !</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Not sure if this has anything to do with it, but it seems that Windows Updates are also not working properly - the 2018-02 cum. upd. for Win 10 v. 1709 x64 (KB 4090913) seems to be stuck in a 'download - install - reboot - start from the top again' loop
 as well ... so maybe something is generally wrong with this pre-installed Windows ?!</p>

<br />Reasons why you might see these errors:
<br /> 
<br />You entered a product key that can't be used to activate Windows. Enter a different product key or buy a new product key.
<br />
<br />You upgraded to Windows 10, but the activation servers were busy. If you upgraded from an activated copy of Windows 7 or ﻿Windows 8.1, your copy of Windows 10 will be automatically activated, or you can wait a while and then select Activate. If you continue to have problems with activation, contact customer support.
<br />
<br />You upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, but Windows 10 isn't activated after a reinstall. Your copy of Windows 10 should automatically be activated as long as you didn't make any significant hardware changes to your device (such as replacing the motherboard). If you continue to have problems with activation, contact customer support.
<br />
<br />As you bought it from a 3rd party seller, please contact them and ask for a replacement. The key most probably is a MAK license where MS have blocked the key.

<p>Hi&nbsp; Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the only one of your answers that could apply to me is the last one (since I did not upgrade from another Win version to 10 but had it originally installed).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already in contact with the vendor to get a replacement but wanted to see what else could be the problem since - guessing by the number of related posts &amp; videos I found in my research - I am not the only one seeing issues with that kind of upgrade
 ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any other ideas with regard to this are still highly welcome ...</p>
<p>

<br />I would recommend you go back to Windows 10 Home, since you won't be able to activate Pro unless you purchase a license.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot you requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5efd42b2-2904-4627-886c-76308f3305df?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5efd42b2-2904-4627-886c-76308f3305df?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now I do have a running &amp; activated Win 10 home utilizing the original key without any actual issues aside from the problem with the not working update (from my PS in the original post). That would be fine except for some Pro features I am missing
 (like HyperV or remote desktop) ... unfortunately I need virtualization &amp; remote access for my work as independent contractor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is entirely possible that I got a 'wrong' (expired etc.) key even though I would not expect that after actually buying it at a 'regular' online store ... we'll see what they have to say about it, I'm waiting for feedback from their help desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless I think that the solution for this can't be that I actually do a re-install from a fresh installation media ... if the reason would be 'just' an expired / blocked license key, then a regular update to Pro should work if I get a working license
 key just the way I tried it (via 'change product key'). If it's some other Win 10 'mumbo jumbo', then there should be some MS related solution out there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I am not really a fan of the idea of reinstalling &amp; setting up everything again ... in that case I'd probably rather look into other directions to get the functionality that I need (e.g. VirtualBox / VMWare / Cloud &amp; something like TeamViewer
 for remote capabilities) and live with Win 10 home.</p>
<p>

            As always you can also contact Microsoft rep but I doubt they would help. They would say please contact the seller but giving a try is not a bad idea.

 and couldn't find any solution, and no new hardware or software has been installed. The last few things were Windows updates for apps that weren't being used or in background at time of crash.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>BugCheck A, {8, ff, 0, fffff803678266b7}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : <strong>ntkrnlmp.exe </strong>( nt!PpmIdleExecuteTransition+8d7 )<br />
<br />
<strong>ntkrnlmp.exe</strong> is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.
<strong>Further analysis did not help.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There were no similar problems with the system before 14393.1066??? Normally I would suspect a hardware issue though if you were not having similar issues before then that is not as likely.</strong><br />
<br />
BiosVersion = V17.5<br />
BiosReleaseDate = <strong>05/18/2010</strong><br />
SystemManufacturer = MSI<br />
SystemProductName = MS-7599<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = MSI<br />
BaseBoardProduct = 870A-G54 (MS-7599)<br />
BaseBoardVersion = 3.0<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>If is extremely important that you have the latest <strong>BIOS</strong>,
<strong>chipset drivers</strong>, and the <strong>major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Check with MSI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />
</p>
<strong>2.</strong> Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>As needed use ALL the methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to&nbsp;see if it can indicate a<br />
CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />
at top&nbsp;of list&nbsp;- click it. <strong>in Windows 8/8.1/10 the&nbsp;name is "Windows Memory

<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>

Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>

Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
My advice would to install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers to avoid down the road issues.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Thought I downloaded both 32-bit &#38; 64-bit versions of Money Sunset Deluxe but same file</h2>
                    <p>I want to get a Windows 7 computer so I need to upgrade from Money 2002 Standard to Money Plus Sunset. I took my Windows XP SP3 laptop to a library in the US, went to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility</a>, entered Money 2002 Standard, got info on the upgrade, selected Windows XP operating system, and saved to a flash drive what should have been
 the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I checked out a 64-bit Windows 7 laptop, did the same, selected Windows 7 operating system, and saved to flash what should have been the 64-bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, both have the same file name: USMoneyDlxSunset.exe</p>
<p>the same number of bytes: 35,677,984 bytes</p>
<p>the same File version: 6.0.2800.1168</p>
<p>and the same Product version: 17,0,120,3817</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 1: Is that the 32-bit version for Windows XP, or the 64-bit version for 64-bit Windows 7?</p>
<p>Question 2: If it's the 32-bit version, what is the file name, etc., of the 64-bit version and how do I download it to flash drive to install later on a 64-bit Windows 7 PC?</p>

    <title>Error while connecting to Internet thru External ADSL router - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error while connecting to Internet thru External ADSL router &#40;Pronet PN-ADSL 101E&#47;U&#41; on Win 7 &#40;Err&#58;797&#41;  </h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am tying to connect to the Internet on my new Win 7 installation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I have installed Win 7 just 6 days ago.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I have installed &amp; uninstalled many softwares.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I set up connection to the Internet using ADSL modem by following below steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETUP 2:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Start-&gt;Control Panel (opened in Category view)-&gt;Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Set Up a Connection or Network -&gt; Connect to the Internet -&gt; Broadband (PPPoE)(in "Connect to the Internet" window) -&gt; (Entered the Connection NAme,
 User Name &amp; password in next "Connect to the Internet" window)Connect -&gt; This showed error "Connection failed with error 797" &amp; below that "A connection to the remoteaccess was not made because the modem was not found." I clicked "Set up the connection anyway"(screen
 shot:http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/3261/finalwindowofthe2ndsetu.png)-&gt;Close.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. But unable to (even login to ISP)connect since it showed: "This connection is not available because there is a problem with your modem or network adapter"(screen shot: http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3280/after2ndsetupnotevenabl.png)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETUP 1:<br />
<br />
Actually above was my second attmept, in which it doesn't&nbsp; even allowed me to loggin to the ISP (I don't no why when it allowed me after my 1rst attempt).<br />
<br />
At my first connection setup which followed the same above procedure, it allowed me to login to ISP, but then it showed the error 797 (screen shot: http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/7862/after1rstsetupwhenloggi.png)<br />
<br />
Few things:</p>
<p>- the router showed correct indicators when connnected to my PC(Win 7)</p>
<p>-the onboard NIC showed green light when I plug the cable</p>
<p>- the router is supposed to be working correctly since I am regularly using it with my another PC with Win Xp</p>
<p>Here is screen shot of what Network Adapter Troubleshooter suggested: http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/4889/networkadaptertroublesh.png</p>
<p>Does I am forgotting something?</p>
<p>I tried to install TCP/IPv4 from the c:/Windows/Inf, but it showed no protocol in the list to install. I also tried by disabling IPv6.</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated. Thanks in advance. ;)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Follow this process to make sure that the network aspects of the computer&nbsp; are On and configured Correctly.<br />
<br />
Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.<br />
<br />
Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Still Not Working, try this too.</strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Software Firewalls.</strong> </em></p>
<p>Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall Windows Firewall has to be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted Zone
 (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls <strong>keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or<strong>totally uninstall it</strong> to allow clean flow of local
 network traffic. If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Reset the Network Stacks</strong> .</p>
<p>Type Cmd in the Start Search text box.<br />
<br />
Press Ctrl-Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to run a&nbsp; Command Prompt as an Administrator.&nbsp; Allow elevation.<br />
<br />
Type<strong> netsh winsock reset</strong> in the Command Prompt , and then press the Enter key.<br />
<br />
Do the same process for refreshing the TCP/IP, just replace the typed command with.<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>

            Thank's friend. At last someone come to rescue me. Great.<br />
Your first few lines only spotted my error. So I did not procedded to the further<br />
<br />
lines<br />
<br />
It seem that my WAN Miniport (PPPOE) is malfunctioning. <br />
<br />
(screenshot:<a href="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4613/devicemanager.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4613/devicemanager.png</a> )<br />
<br />
I disabled it <br />
<br />
(scr:<a href="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/4707/devicemanagerafterdisab.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/4707/devicemanagerafterdisab.png</a>
 ), &amp; tried to <br />
<br />
unintall, but the uninstall screen just splashed but seem to did nothing (scr (after<br />

uninstalling): <a href="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/4774/devicemanagerafterunins.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Finding above things, I don't think it is any problem in my firewall.<br />
I am using BitDefender 2010, with firewall set to allow all processes to communicate<br />
<br />
over network.<br />
<br />
I tried that netsh commands &amp; restarted, but everything remained same. <br />
<br />
Also, i didn't understand this:<br />
<br />
"Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On<br />
<br />
and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are<br />
<br />
connected (few more will be even better)."<br />
<br />
My ISP assigns me only one IP.<br />
So, when I use Internet on one PC, I simply put its RJ45 inside router socket. The<br />
<br />
other is obviously disconnected from the Internet. Hence, few years ago I used to use<br />
<br />
some proxy software to access Internet on both PC using single IP (I have two LANs on<br />
<br />
one PC). Let it be. But now I do not need to use Internet on both PCs at a time.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the latest driver from softpedia <br />
<br />
(http://drivers.softpedia.com/get/NETWORK-CARD/REALTEK/Realtek-RTL810-08101-8111-8168<br />
<br />
-Driver-56581019.shtml) for Realtek 8111/8168 LAN.<br />
<br />
And tried by installing it &amp; then restarting, but in vain.<br />
<br />
Thank's for suggestions. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. I'll like to get my problem solved. <br />

<h2>            Outlook Express for Windows 8</h2>
                    I just upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8. I was using Outlook Express as my email server. I had the files backed up but I want to know what program I need now so I can transfer all of my contacts and emails from Outlook Express.

            There is a Mail app in Windows 8.&nbsp; You can find it by searching Mail from the start screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will ask for your e-mail and password and will then sync the app with your mail account.&nbsp; When it&nbsp;is done syncing, unless there is a problem, everything will
 be there that is on your server.
