                    <p>Original Title: Bluetooth with apt-x audio issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, this is my situation. </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Have Windows 8 installed on PC.</li><li>Have a Sennheiser MM500-x&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;with apt x headphones</li><li>Have a Sennheiser BTD500 USB dongle to connect headphones to PC.</li></ul>
<div>Problem is:</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Audio works, but sound quality is very poor. Also microphone level very low.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For process of&nbsp;elimination&nbsp;purposes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Have connected these headphones using headphone jack - perfect audio</li><li>Have connected headphones to another bluetooth dongle to TV &nbsp;and PC (which uses headphone jack) - perfect audio</li><li>Audio levels suitably high (Can hear at appropriate level, just not clear)</li></ul>
<div>In "playback devices" I am unable to click on the configure button (it is grayed out). So unable to then select stereo sound.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not believe this is an issue with either my headphones or usb dongle. Believe is a windows 8 issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help! I am about to throw my PC out the window!</div>

            I'm the original poster. I tried everything, couldn't fix the problem. So I sold the headset and moved on with my life! Haha. Good luck all.

<h2>            Removing Obsolete Windows Media Player Codecs installed by mistake</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, and I made a mistake and installed Windows Media Player 9 codecs while installing the game "Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth" via Steam. Now ALL of my sound is very choppy and stutter-y. I'm certain
 this has to do with the newly installed codecs, as the problem appeared immediately after their installation, and I've never had any similar trouble previously. How do I uninstall these and revert to the previous Windows Media Player 12 codecs?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>
                </div>

            You'll find them in c:\windows\system32&nbsp;&nbsp; but I would not go deleting willy nilly. If you know the date you installed then you can see which ones were installed by the column "Last Modified".<br />
<br />
I would start by un-installing your audio drivers then cleaning up the registry and then installing new ones you can get from your PRC/Laptop makers website.<br />
<br />

            Are they in some subfolder? Looking at things in c:\windows\system32, I don't see anything from when the codecs were installed.

            <p>
<span>To investigate disk space usage download and install Treesize (freeware).
<br />
</span><a href="https://www.jam-software.de/customers/downloadTrial.php?article_no=80&amp;language=EN&amp;PHPSESSID=6odgempt76un9q9nkj7luf5be0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://www.jam-software.de/customers/downloadTrial.php?article_no=80&amp;language=EN&amp;PHPSESSID=6odgempt76un9q9nkj7luf5be0</span></a></p>

<span>Information on Treesize<br />
</span><a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>When you open Treesize select Scan from the Menu and you will see a list of drives. Click on C and it will generate a list of Folders. Post the names and the sizes of the 6 largest
 folders and the total at the top of the list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner. cCleaner
 comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors.<br />
</span><a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ccleaner.com/download</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>1.9. When you open cCleaner you will see four</span><span> large icons to the left of the window. These are Cleaner,
 Registry, Tools, and Options. For routine maintenance you would normally access Cleaner (this is not the Registry Cleaner mentioned later). When using for the first time you can just accept the default settings.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.10. Some comments on settings. On my computer I do not have boxes before Saved Passwords selected. In a less secure environment you
 might check this option and set cCleaner to automatically run on starting the computer. You may also not want to check boxes before Start Menu Shortcuts, Desktop Shortcuts and Autocomplete Form History. You need to check the boxes to suit your requirements.
 Getting options wrong first time causes irritants not disasters.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.11. The second icon you see when you open cCleaner is Registry. One reservation many experienced users have regarding cCleaner is that
 it comes with a Registry Cleaner. This tool should not be used. Using a Registry Cleaner, however good it is, provides negligible benefits and there is always the risk of creating insoluble system errors, which can only be resolved by reinstalling the operating
 system and all that entails. You avoid any possible problems by not clicking on the Registry icon.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.12 The third icon you see when you open cCleaner is Tools. If you click on this icon it gives you access to further routine maintenance
 options. The first two tools are Uninstall and Startup. I do not use these Tools, preferring to use other software options. The third Tool is System Restore, which is covered in the next paragraph. The fourth tool is Drive Wiper and you will find comments
 on this Tool later</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.13 Removing System Restore points can be important if you have limited free disk space. The ability to remove them is one of the Tools
 options. You can selectively remove those created at less important times. This makes it easier to hold restore points for longer periods without retaining large unwanted files, which the inflexible approach adopted by Disk CleanUp fails to offer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.14. You cannot remove the latest restore point using Disk CleanUp or cCleaner. If the latest restore point contains malware you can
 turn off and then turn system restore back on. This has the disadvantage that all restore points are removed when you may wish to retain older restore points that are not infected. The way to get round this problem is to create a new restore point when you
 are satisfied your computer is free of malware and then remove the infected restore point.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.15. In normal circumstances you most likely will rarely need to use Driver Wiper. However, there are some situations like if you were
 giving the computer to someone else, then the Tool might be useful. Please note that Drive Wiper, when opened, generates a warning</span>
<span>message, which should not be dismissed lightly. Using Drive Wiper for the wrong reason could have serious consequences!</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.16. The fourth icon is labelled Options. A lot of configuration options are available there. You can set cCleaner to run when you boot
 but remember this will slow the boot. Another setting enables you to include / exclude cookies. Yet another enables named files to be excluded</span></p>

            In future, assuming you did actually delete the game, uninstall the game.<br />
Never just delete any software, always uninstall via Programs and Feature,<br />
of with an uninstaller that may be in the software's&nbsp; folder/directory.<br />
<br />
Sometimes there may be some flies left after uninstalling. You can delete these<br />
if you wish. <br />
<br />
If your recycle bin is very large the files may still be there waiting for you to delete them permanently (if the Bin is not that large you would have seen a message asking if you wanted to delete the file permanently) . This may explain why you did not regain
 the HDD space.<br />
btw - a recycle bid large enough to hold a game is wasting space. You can limit<br />
the size - R/click on the Bin icon and go to Properties. You can adjust the Bin size here.<br />
<br />
Why did you uninstall the game from the D:\ drive ? Personally, I never install <br />
games to Program Files (x86) as it can cause problems with some games.<br />
If it was because you are running out of space you are only postponing the <br />
inevitable - a larger , or second&nbsp; HDD.<br />

<h2>            XBOX ONE ELITE Controller - Not Syncing - Not Connecting</h2>
                    
<p>Brand New 1 day old Elite Xbox One - Controller will not sync.</p>
<p>Elite controller is updated, it received the latest update.</p>
<p>Xbox One Elite console received the new update.</p>
<p>Replaced batteries (Used 8 sets of batteries, Duracells and Energizers)</p>
<p>Plugged in USB - Works when plugged in, unplug after a few minutes and light just flashes indefinitely and will not sync.</p>
<p>Tried syncing via sync button on console and controller.</p>
<p>Power Cycled Console numerous times.</p>
<p>Unplugged console numerous times.</p>
<p>FACTORY RESET the Elite Console 5 times.....</p>

<p>So far this is a total disappointment so far! $500 console and the *** controller won't sync!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 keeps saying ERROR a required storage device has been removed. Your console will now restart.</h2>
                    Xbox 360 keeps saying ERROR a required storage device has been removed. Your console will now restart. It only happens with some DVD's, I have the xbox 360 slim with no external hard drive or memory units just the xbox memory. It has never done this before
 until now. What could this be? Any help at all would be appreciated. Thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the problem once with one of my 360s.</p>
<p>Try to clear your system cache.</p>
<p>In Xbox Home--System -&gt; Storage -&gt; highlight the device -&gt; Press Y -&gt; Clear System Cache -&gt; then restart your console</p>
<p>That worked for me.</p>

<p>When watching movies or playing music, the disc tries to buffer a lot of the info. &nbsp;Since Microsoft OS's use a lot of virtual memory (which is utilizing your storage space as RAM,) check your 4gigs and see how full it is. &nbsp;You may need to delete some of
 your older files off of it (ie save games you no longer play or games that installed themselves.)</p>

So why is my xbox live gold not sharing? For some reason it has all the games and apps and everything. But it shows I don't have a gold subscription. I have tried to restart my console and nothing.

<p>Did you try redeeming the code through the website? If so, try via your console instead because it seemed like the website had a hiccup during that time (otherwise there would be no reason for such a code to appear)</p>
<p>If you've tried both methods again and you still fail to redeem the code, try to give Xbox support a call (just copy and paste the following link) support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false</p>

    <title>Mouse double-clicks when I single-click only. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nowveryfrustratedindeed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse double-clicks when I single-click only.</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been going on for some time and seems to be getting worse since the last Windows 10 update a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to single click I get a double click instead. </p>
<p>IE:-</p>
<p>On the net I try to go back one page by using the back arrow and I go back two pages.</p>
<p>I try to close a window on the desk top and the Icon underneath the arrow clicks open.</p>
<p>In games the double click causes problems without end.</p>
<p>In a music folder I try to select a single track to add to a Play list and the track underneath opens in my music player because it`s double clicked.</p>
<p>many other cases of trying to use a single click, but getting a double click instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see it`s not confined to a browser, desktop or folder, but everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it may be my mouse and brought a new one............ SAME PROBLEM !</p>
<p>I tried an older mouse ................ SAME PROBLEM.</p>
<p>I tried all my mice on different PC`s running Windows 8.1 and XP.........They worked !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I`ve looked through the many pages of feed back and found several instances of this problem being mention and none have been solved. So I`m asking my own to see if the others have just been missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the mouse driver and restarting the PC. Did not solve it.</p>
<p>Upon looking at the driver date I found that MS hasn`t even updated the driver in YEARS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Provider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft</p>
<p>Driver Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21/06/2006</p>
<p>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.0.10586.0</p>
<p>Digital signer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to any answer, solution or response.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts, I will surely help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To understand the issue better, let me know what is the make and model of the computer and mouse?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
Let's first run hardware troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press
<strong>Windows Key </strong><span>on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) Type
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search box and hit <strong>enter</strong>.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Hardware and sound.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on
<strong>Hardware and device </strong>and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to un-install and re-install mouse driver from the computer manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Un-install the drivers:
<br />
<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows Key </strong><span>on</span> the <strong>keyboard.<br />
</strong>b. Type “<strong>device Manager</strong>” without quotes in the search box and hit<strong> Enter.<br />
</strong>c. <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>touchpad drivers </strong>
and select <strong>“Uninstall”.<br />
</strong>d. <strong>Restart </strong>the computer once it is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<br />
</span></strong><span>Download the latest mouse drivers from the computer manufacturer website in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To install the
</span></strong><strong><span>mouse
</span></strong><strong><span>driver

<strong>Download </strong>the latest </span><span>mouse
</span><span>driver&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.
<br />
b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.<br />
c. Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab. <br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select latest Windows version</strong>&nbsp;from the drop down list. <br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Just to add that I never had this kind of problem with Windows 95, Windows 98, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. Only on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems rather strange,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I`ve tried many things again including the trouble shooter ranging from altering the Click Height and speed to different Mice. I have seen an improvement as the `Double Click` is less obvious now, still happens mind you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that I won`t get a full cure from here, but as I can`t afford to buy a new computer as this one is only just over&nbsp;a year old, I`ll have to stay with Windows 10 and give Apple a miss.</p>

            This happens to both my laptops after the last windows updates. It is very frustrating and it needs to be fixed asap. Windows in 2016 and bad mouse support? No need to wait for July/August regular update, it needs to be fixed ASAP. Even in mouse settings
 in control panel, if I change the slider in mouse double click speed I see no difference AT ALL. The mouse operation in windows is not something of secondary priority...Again, this needs to be fixed ASAP.

            <p>I have a MSFT wireless mouse 5000 that's been doing the same thing for a few weeks now. I've tried it on different machines, I've uninstalled the driver and mouse program and remained very frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening, after searching tomshardware I found changing the mouse pad might be the cause. So I changed it. NO JOY!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of frustration, I raised the mouse about a foot off the desk and brought it down with some force.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's working fine now.</p>

            These are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always </span>the recommended steps and they DO NOT help.&nbsp; After using the community forum with no success last fall, I tried the tech assistance.&nbsp; Three different tech folks used remote desktop access

<p>What is the relative quality of the 2.5" hard drive in the 360 when compared to the most modern hard drive widely available at the time of this post, what file types are supported by the XBOX 360 operating system, what format standard is used to protect

 consumer grade (nor enterprise grade)&nbsp;mechanical HDD can perform that function. There's no way to "prove" a negative. I can point out that there's no documentation that describes how the read/write heads would accomplish this, given that they're all sitting
 on the same actuator. <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/seagate-hdd-harddrive,8279.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Conner/Seagate tried it</a>, apparently made one 2GB drive, and that was the end of it. That's the physical reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logically, modern systems don't care.&nbsp;Processes send read/write requests to the OS. OS and the drives take care of processing them. You can monitor a Windows PC's disk activity with&nbsp;Resource monitor if you want to see for yourself. If you want to knoww how
 this works, take a class or read a book on operating systems.</p>

<p>Heh, no. Spindles are for chumps. SDD pricing has fallen dramatically in the past few months. The 512GB Crucial M4 I bought for $700 late November? Yeah, just bought two more at $399 each. $300 price drop in less than 9 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need massive capacity, yeah, HDD's still the way to go, but HDDs are no longer market leaders on balance. The second gen Momentus XT is a decent compromise, though.</p>

<p>all i know is they are 5400RPM laptop hard drives basically, a few years ago people found a way to get better HDD to work on 360.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>all they did was download a file found on all HDDs and move it onto another.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>1tb 7200rpm HDD for the win, but MS got mad panda and forced their over priced HDDs on people.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>sad too, because &nbsp;if they let us use anything, a 1tb HDD would be perfect for 360, cheaper too, then next gen it could just be moved over, since its still large and other then a SSD will be the same speed as any next gen HDD ( unless they go 1000RPM but
 i doubt that.)</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having BSOD errors with my PC on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only when I boot the machine for the first time, and always within the first few seconds, normally I wouldn't even get into the desktop before it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine then does the memory dump process, and then proceeds to boot normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled Windows, and I'm still having the same issue.</p>
<p>The machine has never blue screened while I've been using it, it's only on the first boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only error I can see is -&nbsp;The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x00000139 (0x0000000000000003, 0xffffd00024e37500, 0xffffd00024e37458, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 9e9dd043-0a15-41fa-bc08-d29f18615c3a.</p>

</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.5&nbsp;should already be available in the Turn Windows Features on and off component in Control Panel. These are the&nbsp;latest versions.</p>

            Hi Ronnie Vernon, Thank you for your quick reply.
<div>I read the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>&nbsp;you referred. As I mentioned above since I'm trying to install offline, the first two steps in the link were not able to follow. So I have to try the method given for offline use, which I have already tried and the last image of the command prompt
 shows the error. But I found a manual page link to downlaod. It contains a complete troubleshoot information about .Net 3.5 (<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;</span><font color="#03697a"><span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=256570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft

<div><br />
<div>And I need help with this. It contains very high technical words and I couldn't understand completely.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is an instruction in the page 6 as "<span>For an offline reference image". &nbsp;Here I didn't understand this instruction.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Run the following DISM command (image mounted to the c:\test\offline folder and the installation media in the D:\drive) to install .NET 3.5:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">All I have is Windows 8.1 enterprise evaluation image(.ISO image) copy, &nbsp;which contains .Net Framework 3.5., which is the image in C:\test\offline? Even why do I need this image when I have the Operating System image with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">So the only other method is using this command (<span style="color: rgba(0, 100, 0, 1)">DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:d:\sources\sxs), which is giving the error as I've shown in the snapshot
 of command prompt in the end. Help me with this manual.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Exactly.&nbsp; Not to mention, what is the point of a 231MB download if it's just going to go to the Internet anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reasons anyone would download this is: (1) Machine doesn't have .NET 3.5 components AT ALL and (2) They cannot access Windows Update (either technical problem or offline computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need .NET 3.5 and I can't get it installed either.&nbsp; Nomatter what I do I get a windows update error and the stupid installer refuses to try to do a local install.</p>

<p>
</p><p>so this may be a moot point by now since its a couple months later... but I have had luck with this:<br />
<br />
https://www.techgainer.com/tools/net-framework-3-5-offline-installer-windows-10-8-x/</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately, it requires that you have the OS install media, which in your situation may be no problem, however I am currently out int he middle of the north pacific on an island with barely functional satellite internet... so getting a 4GB windows 10
 ISO file downloaded is not going to be easy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While on other projects in other places it worked like a charm on server 2016 and win 10. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Edge Tiles constantly rearranging</h2>
                    <p>If I pick a news story to read on Edge, I can't get back to where I was to look at the next news story-the tiles are all rearranged.</p>
<p>It doesn't make any difference if I use the back arrow or hit the home key.&nbsp; So it takes me forever to find the next story I wanted to view. Does anyone know how to fix that?&nbsp; It's very frustrating and makes me use Chrome more when I'd rather use Edge!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

<p>I just changed the password on my PC user account and received an email that my Microsoft account password was changed.&nbsp; Just logged in with the new password to send this message so I know the account password was truly changed when I thought I was making
 a change to my PC user profile.&nbsp; Telemetry at work.&nbsp; So I thought I should see if I could "Sign in with a local account instead" and a warning message popped up that made me think I had launched a cryptolocker-type virus.&nbsp; Guess I don't want to do that.&nbsp; I
 just updated to the Fall Creators version in an effort to stop having Candy Crush Saga and other apps that I do not want from reappearing in my start menu after being "uninstalled" numerous times.&nbsp; Still don't know if the new version fixed that little problem,
 but I sure do have some new problems.&nbsp; I can't figure out whether I will be able to log on to my PC if I am not connected to the internet.&nbsp; Guess I will find out soon enough.&nbsp;

 the middle of the night, and you wake up to a new mine field every morning.</p>

                    I have just reset my pc and am going through the set up process but when I put in the “basic information and the “Get going fast” section, it loads and then just restarts windows again and this keeps happening. This has never happened in the past times
 I’ve done a reset and I didn’t do anything different. I’ve tried clearing my cmos and I don’t know what to do.

<p><span>Hello Ktichenor,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<span>When you are working on your computer and installing a new program, the installation suddenly fails. Now you are left with a partly installed program. You try to install the program again, but you are unsuccessful. Or, maybe you
 have problems trying to remove an old program because the installation files are corrupted.
<br />
<br />
Do not worry. Windows Installer CleanUp Utility might be able to help. You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the
 actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over.</span></p>

<p>Some people by the gamer tags of <strong>[Moderator removed: name and shame]</strong> were who we were playing with. It was Modern Warfare 3, and they said in the in-game chat that they were going to boot me,<strong>[Mod removed]</strong>, my friend, off
 the game. <br />
<br />
Seconds later, the screen froze and the connection was disconnected. I checked my wireless router and it was flashing red. I got back online and searched for face-off 2v2 again. We were placed back in the same game. We were again booted off the internet. Please,
 I would like something done about this. They could currently be tampering with other players' internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there, it sounds like these users (no naming and shaming please; Policy Enforcement doesn't monitor the forums), at least one of them issued a
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-live/connecting/dos-attacks-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DoS Attack</a>. Here is what is suggested to do when you are DoS attacked.<br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
<br />
<span>What should I do if I think I've been attacked?</span></p>
<div>
<p>If you believe that your Xbox 360 console or computer has experienced a DoS or DDoS attack, you should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/error-cant-obtain-ip-address-router-modem-978976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset your Internet router</a>&nbsp;(see "Solution 2: Restart your network equipment")
</li><li>Contact your ISP </li><li>If you are certain of the identity of the DoS or DDoS attacker:
<ul>
<li>Contact the attacker’s ISP </li><li><span>File a complaint with Xbox. (To learn more about how to file a complaint, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/chat-terms-of-use-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Player
 complaints and Xbox LIVE suspensions and bans</span></a>.)</span>
<ul>
<li><span>When you file the complaint, select the "tampering" category when filling out your complaint form.</span>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Avoid the individual in the future when you use Xbox LIVE </li></ul>
<p><br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
Resetting your router should help you out short term, whereas contacting your ISP may be better for having you set up with a fresh IP Address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To have these users reported, like mentioned, please file a complaint. Once that is done, they'll be investigated by the Policy Enforcement Team. It may take some time, but it'll happen.
<br />
<br />
I hope that helps, feel free to ask any further questions!&nbsp;</p>
