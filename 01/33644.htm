<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies about the long delay..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calvin, I found this on another post that displays the same symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi Mike,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After researching, therefore is no Office 365 setting to control this time. And there is no official instruction to improve the time. Thanks
 for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Based on your description, first, the UM Play on Phone feature works. The only problem is that: there is 10 seconds delay on the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Upon disfdcussion, I find this might not be an issue, and it should be a performance related behavior. When the user uses Play on Phone the
 first time, Office 365 mailbox will send the voice messages to local phone number. The system will process some handshake protocols. There might be some delay during this process. Later, some related cache might be generated on mobiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Therefore, after the first successful try, the latter Play on Phone will be faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If our community members have any experience about this scenario, generous sharing is greatly appreciated.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool - Bugs &#38; Invalid Hash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webmaster2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Media Creation Tool - Bugs &#38; Invalid Hash</h2>
                    <p>I just wanted to let the Microsoft Team and the community know about this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to fix most of the bugs in the Windows 10 upgrade is with a clean install or an operating system refresh after the upgrade. Most users are not aware of this procedure, but it allows you to reinstall the operating system's core files without data
 loss. The only way to do it is with a burned ISO file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I use the Media Creation tool to download the ISO, it doesn't download completely. I compare it with the file hash taken from entries on the MSDN Subscriber Downloads website: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/hh442898.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hash of the file downloaded by the Media Creation tool doesn't match the actual hash. Here are the right ISO file names on the MSDN to compare hashes with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool 1607 for both Home &amp; Pro (regular download):</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 (Multiple Editions), Version 1607 (Updated Jul 2016) (x86)</li><li>Windows 10 (Multiple Editions), Version 1607 (Updated Jul 2016) (x64)</li></ul>
<p>Just search for these iso files on the MSDN Subscriber Downloads site and copy the corresponding SHA1 hash into a program like HashTab to compare.</p>
<p>To legitimately direct download the official ISO file <strong>from Microsoft</strong>, follow this tutorial:</p>
<p>http://techdows.com/2015/08/use-this-trick-to-get-windows-10-iso-direct-download-links.html</p>
<p>This workaround may not be available if Microsoft decides to change their download page. However, the file hash now matches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without a formal way to compare file hashes, many users can receive partial ISO files. With those or with a non-refreshed Windows upgrade, users can be subjected to install errors (in which they blame Windows 10 for, thus hurting its reputation unnecessarily).
 Microsoft's indirect way of displaying file hashes for their ISO files should be improved. Anyone agree?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Key rights due to Dell Alienware Bios not allowing free upgrade to install, UEFI secure Boot issue</h2>
                    <p>Okay, here is my and many other Alienware Aurora 3 owners and I've read many other threads on this same issue with other PC Manf's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell / Alienware on it's BIOS ( which they refuse to upgrade or even offer support on) will not allowing the free upgrade from Windows 7 64bit Utilimate to Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can download media creation and do a fresh install use UEFI boot option, but I then would have a no activated version of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; What can be done here, surley having a geneuine OEM Windows 7 Ultimate OS, there has to be someone we can get
 a key to activate Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is after all a free upgrade, it is not the end users fault that Dell or Microsoft have not worked together to address this issue during beta testing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>look forward to replies, espeiclaly from a Microsoft agent.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Deepark, thank for reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reason I want to install, is I am very impressed by it, I have it installed on 3 of business's Pc's Del XPS 730 and Inpision laptops, two of these units are not on Dell's list of tested
 for Win 10, and are older systems. </span></p>
<p><span>I find&nbsp;it connects to our company server via remote desktop way better than 7 or 8.1 and it is a big improvement on Window s8 or 8.1, now that settings etc are al back on left of screen
 where start window Icon is. </span></p>
<p><span>Also finding recent files is way easier, I like the right click feature on File Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe not a big fan yet of Edge, our Govt's Tax office web site uses a program to allow business and consumers to lodge tax returns etc, as so far that software is not compatible with MS
 Edge, now that seems strange, but I know IE is still on Win 10. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now I had tried the suggestions from the post at Del Alien ware and had no success, but last evening I gave it one more go, as I read something elsewhere about running off some hyper threading
 CPU settings in these systems, which are really for XP or earlier use. ( not sure the last bit is true or not)&nbsp; Now whether it was co-incidence or not, doing the Hard Shut down at 29%, it got to 100% installed, ( great but ruddy frustrating what happened next)
 &nbsp;never ever got past 33%, however something locked up system at Bios load window, which was a mistake of mine that I had USB 3 Portable HD connected, there is something about USB 3.0 that Window s10 Pro doesn't like, well Dell's USB ports, that same thread
 mentions to install a driver to update them from Dell's website. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will do that this evening and really baby sit this install to see if I can get 100% again and see if no usb device connected bar keyboard USB 2.00 only
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Strange that it install all drivers and features and then locked up and then refused to continue lading Window s10 for first time, Deepark you have any idea why USB 3 ports / drivers are
 an issue, as this issue is not Del only. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if one reads back on other posts about this issue, it dates way back to release of Windows 8.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I have said one would of hoped that during Beta stages this would of been ironed out, I am a TechNet member and find people saying that.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes I have used Media Creation tool, last night it was through Windows Update.
</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers</span></p>

</p><p><span>Hi again Deepark</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will stand corrected &amp; what I am typing below is for others who may have similar problem and maybe not just with Dell systems.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not 100% sure why I succeed this time except that I didn't have any USB device attached bar a keyboard during install phase &amp; not in a USB 3 port.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even if one updates the onboard USB 3 on Alienware Aurora R3. With the
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=R286402&amp;amp
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 still will not start with a device plugged into a USB port. Run this driver update before upgrade of Win 10 and run it again after Win 10 has upgraded your system.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise it will not boot past first time one sees Windows Blue Logo.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hard Shut down at precisely 29% and again 75% is required ( why I guess only Dell can tell us)
</span></p>
<p><span>29% is where it has finished copying files, you will see the wording copying files change from White to different colour text, same at 75%, installing drivers and features will have changed
 from white to another colour, I believe after 75% is when Apps are loaded. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One other thing I did, is backed up all my files etc with a windows 8 full back up and then did a clean install from OEM Win 7 disk, not sure if this helped or not.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also I turned off Hyper Threading option in the bios under CPU settings, again, cannot say it helped or not for sure.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact&nbsp;System&nbsp;Maker's&nbsp;Support and the seller. As OEM the System Maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And
 the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would&nbsp;want it fully documented just in&nbsp;case there are&nbsp;related&nbsp;problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they
 will say it is something you have done.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

</p><p>I did the instructions in the article you sent me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final line in my command prompt was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>(According to the article: "This means that you do not have any missing or corrupted system files.")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the applications I mentioned are still now working.</p>

    <title>Installed Windows 10, Outlook now not sending emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installed Windows 10, Outlook now not sending emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I upgraded my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Everything went well, started the day working and after a while I realised my emails were not sending. They were all just sitting in the Outbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Deleted the entire profile</p>
<p>- Ran new setup</p>
<p>- Re-set up the profile</p>
<p>- Re-set up the mail account</p>
<p>- Tested the same settings on an alternate PC, worked fine.</p>
<p>- Able to send emails from webmail</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the problem is isolated to the Outlook program itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed apart from upgrading to Windows 10. Nothing else was installed / configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error message displayed:</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>Task *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Sending' reported error (0x800CCC13) : 'Cannot connect to the network. Verify your network connection or modem.'</span>

<h2>            add a device to view photos</h2>
                    <p>Under photos, there, there's an icon that says "Add a Device to view photos." Exactly what is that? I clicked on it thinking it might recognize the fact that I inserted my sd card but it says it can't find any photos in here. It said to go to sky drive and
 install that but does that mean I can only fetch my photos if I'm connected to the internet?</p>

            <p>First of all, is there a trick to getting the Device manager to open by clicking the Windows Key +R?</p>
<p>Each time I do that Device manager opens except it won't stay open. When I let go of the Windows key and R, the screen goes back to the start page so I can't type anything in the search field.</p>
<p>Second, I did read the FAQ before posting my question but it doesn't help me with what I want to do. I don't want to have to be connected to the internet when viewing pictures from an SD card and I don't want to load them on the tablet. For me it defeats
 the purpose of being able to use an external memory device.</p>
<p>I was hoping there might be some app I could download that would work as a photo viewing tool since I can't seem to get the pre loaded photo app to work the way I want it to work.</p>

<p>I have the latest version of Skype on my phone. I have tried ForceStop. I have restarted my phone. I can be in the phone call but I can't end the phone call or make use of the onscreen keypad. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition. Holding the power button
 does not turn off the phone. The only way I can end the phone call is by double clicking the home button, which brings up the camera with a small Skype screen that allows me to hang up. I believe this problem just started, I noticed it about a week ago. It
 is not a problem with my proximity sensor, because I can make a regular cell call and not have a problem. Only when making a skype call.</p>

                    <p>When I select someone and open the send message option, no keyboard appears to let me type a message. I can send voice messages but no text.&nbsp; I can do voice chat, invite to/join parties, and do all of the other things that would go away when banned.

<h2>            I think xbox should be less strict</h2>
                    <p>I love xbox in every way but with account suspensions i believe they are way to strict. what ever happened to "sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me?" if you say something in a message that even involves a cuss word you will most likely get banned and xbox should change that. they should implement a warning system, for example, you send a message with a cuss word in it and it gets reported. you shouldn't get banned right away, you should get a message from xbox saying something like "you have been saying some bad things so well be monitoring your account for a few days" and if you do something else, then yes you can get banned. that should happen unless you make a legitimate threat. getting banned over smack talk is ridiculous, i mean half the xbox community is 10 year olds that curse&nbsp;more&nbsp;than a sailor. and in reality, no one really gets offended by some of these messages and the only reason they report you is just to get you banned</p>

<p>As the message explains, WMP "might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of media file formats and codecs; no media player can play them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the term 'file format' I am referring to the 3- or 4-digit suffix after the final 'dot' in the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to go on the internet and search for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>media players that play&nbsp;<em>format</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>where you replace <em>format</em> with the file format. Your search results will show you media players you can download and install that will play the file format in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these could be the popular <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VLC Media Player</a>, which plays lots of formats that Windows Media Player cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, Windows Media Player is old and I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft eventually gets rid of it. Microsoft prefers we use the Groove app, which is newer and gets better support.</p>

<p>For 13 years I been using the number one best, free and safest codec pack there is that will play every audio and&nbsp;video file type. It is easy to set up and you can select Windows media player as the default player. It is the Shark007 Codec Pack. It also
 has built in thumbnail previews for files. I have also&nbsp;set this up on hundreds of other people PC's and they love it too. It is flawless and you can create your playlists in WMP.&nbsp;VLC is not so great and neither is any other player. It is 100% malware free.
 You can select 1 box and you are set to play all in WMP and there are many settings to also use for advanced users. You can use the LAV splitter, FFDShow and much more. You can set up for 5.1 and more audio layouts, equalizer, switch 4:3 format videos to 16:9
 widescreen and more. Most people over the years have switched to Shark007 from the horrific troubled K-Lite Codec Pack. I guarantee you install this, do quick set up and you are home free for ever with flawless media playing in WMP.</p>

<p>As the message explains, WMP "might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of media file formats and codecs; no media player can play them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the term 'file format' I am referring to the 3- or 4-digit suffix after the final 'dot' in the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to go on the internet and search for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>media players that play&nbsp;<em>format</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>where you replace <em>format</em> with the file format. Your search results will show you media players you can download and install that will play the file format in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these could be the popular <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VLC Media Player</a>, which plays lots of formats that Windows Media Player cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, Windows Media Player is old and I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft eventually gets rid of it. Microsoft prefers we use the Groove app, which is newer and gets better support.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(LOL, WMP is old. "NOT") Shark007 has been around almost as long as K-lite and is the best there is to play any media type in any player. Why would you download a bunch of media players????</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, as it happens, WMP is NOT "the best there is". It is clearly the one you happen to prefer and that's great...but "best"? Not so much.</p>
<p>The Videolan VLC Player available both from the Microsoft Store (and from Videolan's official website DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE) is VERY good. The Equalizer and other tools make it perfect for playing audio AND video (including your PURCHASED
 DVDs as well as DVD-Rs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes, also, provides a fine audio/video player though it lags a little behind the others on some Video and Audio Formats (it has a problem with FLAC, for example, but the sound quality is awesome and it does automatically what my old record player used
 to do. It reads connected tracks so that breaks during live albums and concept albums (think concerts and such things as DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED by THE MOODY BLUES) do NOT occur.</p>

</p><p>Well WMP with Shark007 plays everything trouble free. Every possible audio and video setting there is. I have 5.1 surround sound on my PC and the sound is superb. I never had any problems with A/V sync unless it was a bad ripped file or any problem playing
 any audio or video file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Video Lan has far less ability and settings then Shark007 codec pack. Personally Video Lan sucks except for streaming for network purposes.</p>

    <title>Screen Tearing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenji san  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Tearing&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been getting a lot of screen tearing on pretty much every game I've played recently (Assassins creed II, Dead Island, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake).&nbsp; Its really noticeable and it happens quite often.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is just how the
 system works, or if its a device issue.&nbsp; I've had the issue on two different 360s, an old 60gb model, and the new slim model.&nbsp; I've also tried it on two HD TVs and the issue has not gotten better.&nbsp; I had an old 1080p 60hz Vizio, and I upgraded to a 60 inch
 sharp (LED, 1080P, 120HZ).&nbsp; I am using HDMI cables as well.&nbsp; Do I just need to mess with the settings on the TV, or is it just an issue with the game/system itself?&nbsp;

<p>try setting your xbox to 720p instead, if the scaler in your tv is any good it will look just as good (or better in my case),the tv will scale it to 1080p, give it a try for a day or two see if it helps, if the scaler isn't too good it might add input lag
 or degrade the picture quality.</p>

<p>I will definitely try that. &nbsp;I didn't know about this method, so I will give it a go with the most problematic games and see if there is any difference. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Unfortunately what it sounds like you are seeing is vsync issues. I know I saw a lot of tearing when I tried Dead Island and Alan Wake employs "smart vsync" when the framerate is over 30fps.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You can try the recommended setting above but the rendering comes before the scaling and it is also up to the developer to decide if they want the additional cost enabling vsync in their game as having it enable, you take a big hit in performance.</p>

<p>Enabling fixed V-Sync is not always ideal. For an example if you play a game synced to 60Hz and the frame rate drops below 60fps, the game is automatically &nbsp;re-synced to 30fps. If it drops again (below 30fps), it is re-synced to 15fps and if the same happens
 again, frames are dropped (meaning it won't be send to the screen). So to provide somewhat stable rate of motion , developers disable V-Sync, which means the majority of frames rendered by the console are send to the screen. But that leads to two different
 types of problems. 1. Unstable motion and 2, tearing. This is because it's not possible to fit number other than 30 and 15 into 60. So some developers program the game to drop frames while maintaining somewhat stable motion (or repeat the frame 2-3 times).
 End result: Clean frames but the motion isn't consistent, which is ok for certain games but not for all games. The other option is to merge two frames into one, this leads to tearing (as you're clearly witnessing atm). This provide consistent motion at the
 cost of visual quality. Certain developers isolate tearing near the top (HALO 3, ODST and Reach all programmed to tear at the top) but not developers have managed to achieve this. If you're playing it on the PC, you can modify the files or force the GPU to
 enable V-Sync, but on console, there's no such option. </p>
