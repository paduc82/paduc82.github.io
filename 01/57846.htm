    <title>How do I re-install a corrupt Remote Desktop Connection host&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richcobley  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I re-install a corrupt Remote Desktop Connection host&#63;</h2>
                    Last week I stopped being able to make remote desktop connections to my Vista Business machine.&nbsp; It's killing me - I normally use it all the time to work from home!&nbsp; When I connect from the client, I log in, and it opens an RDC window on to the host with
 the Vista Business logo on a blue background and the text "The system cannot find the file specified."&nbsp; The RDC connection is still 'working' and the window has the gray bar at the top to let me close the RDC, but some files must have been damaged on the host
 which stops it from letting me properly connect and control the desktop.<br />
<br />
I've run the repair utility on the DVD but it didn't find any problems.&nbsp; I didn't want to restore to an earlier point.&nbsp; I've tried googling the error message and remote desktop connection issues, but the results are all swamped with connection problems.&nbsp; I've
 looked in installed programs on control panel, and Windows options to try and see if I can uninstall and re-install but it's not there.&nbsp; I couldn't find anywhere online saying which files RDC needs and whether I can just copy those back over from the DVD.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to do this?&nbsp; Or any way to work out which file RDP can't find?<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed on my PC- I've not installed any new software or changed any security settings, apart from letting the normal MS updates trickle through.&nbsp; I think this is just a case of some files have got damaged, but I need to know which ones and how
 to fix them!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Richard.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>What type of repair was performed on the computer from the DVD?</span></p>
<p><span>There might be some corruption in the system files as you have predicted, let’s try to run SFC scan to check if there are corruption in the system files.<br />
<br />
Steps to perform SFC scan</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator
 or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files need any replacement SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information.</span></p>

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Ran sfc - says everything is fine.&nbsp; Read through all the troubleshooting options, and either everything is fine, or it doesn't apply to me.<br />
<br />
I ran a few other tests - I disabled Windows firewall and Norton antivirus, and still it wouldn't connect.<br />
<br />
I'm connecting using an IP address, and I've checked that the IP address is still correct.<br />
<br />
I tried connecting deliberately using the wrong password, and RDC realises the password is incorrect - so there is definitely an active connection to the host, in order for it to verify that the password is correct / incorrect.&nbsp; When I enter the correct password
 the RDC screen takes over, as normal, but then I just get a blank blue screen with the above error message.&nbsp; (Note this is not a 'blue screen of death', it's a graphical blue screen with the Vista logo on).<br />
<br />
So RDC makes the connection to the host ok, but then says some file is missing.&nbsp; I just don't know which file is missing on the host or how to repair it.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas anyone?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
R.

            Sorry, I didn't reply about the repair option.&nbsp; I'm not sure tbh.&nbsp; I put the DVD in and re-booted to it and then selected the repair option.&nbsp; It thought for a while.&nbsp; Then it asked me whether I wanted to restore to an earlier point, and I said no.&nbsp; I left
 it going for about an hour and when I came back it said it was done but had found no problems.<br />

<p>I had the same problem, under slightly different circumstances: OS is XP SP3, and RDC to the host returned me right back to the initial RDC login screen, i.e., there was no response whatsoever from the Host system. Running SFC fixed the issue.<br />
<br />
I have now found out that updated nVidia drivers caused RDC to break. I will be testing out updated drivers to see if they have corrected their problem. Thanks for the answer, Sreekanth.<br />

            You can create a sub-folder, but it won't register in Start Menu until there's at least one shortcut added, created in there.

    <title>Constant Game crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dainelstrohmeyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant Game crashes</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues that started about a week ago. Any time I play a game the game freezes and crashes, sometimes the entire PC crashes and restarts. I have been playing these games (ESO and World of Warships mainly) for a while and nothing has changed in
 the game. I even ran a GPU test and it crashed it as well. The game will open and log in okay, usually, but then will crash once I actually start playing. I have reinstalled ESO that did not help. I cleaned out my PC for dust, monitored temps, all I can think
 of at this point. I thought it was a game problem, but since it happens on multiple games and I have seen on various threads lately this is happening all over with all types of games I figured it was not a game specific thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP, I have tried everything I can think of and nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should not that when I am not playing a game, the PC runs fine.</p>

            1. Do you have any entry corresponding to this in Event Logs? 
<br />Type event in Cortana search &gt; Click Event Viewer &gt; See if any log corresponding to your date and time is there (Look under all entries under Windows Logs such as Application, Security...) &gt; If yes, right click on that log &gt; Save Selected Event &gt; Zip all event files which correspond to your event, upload them to Onedrive and share the link here.
<br />
<br />2. Look into below Microsoft help for help on games crashing. (The article is not for Win 10 but valid for Win 10 also)

<h2>            Microsoft Reclusa media keys don&#39;t work in MediaCenter 15.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Reclusa keyboard with the 1.05 drivers installed on Win7 64-bit Ultimate.&nbsp; In J.River's Media Center 15, only the volume knob works.&nbsp; The PLAY/PAUSE, Next Trace, Previous Track, and Shuffle keys all do nothing.&nbsp; If I change to WMP and select the
 WMP profile in the 1.05 drivers, all keys work.&nbsp; The only options are WMP, iTunes, WinAMP, and RealPlayer.&nbsp; How do I create and add another "Media Player Option"&nbsp; so that I can use the media keys with MC15?</p>
<p>I posted in the MC15 forum, but they can't help me.&nbsp; Razer does not offer this product in their support forums, saying instead I have to go to Microsoft.&nbsp; What is odd is that if I uninstall the 1.05 drivers, then all media keys work in MC15.&nbsp; However, if
 I do that then I can't use any of the handy key remapping features of the keyboard which is why I bought it in the first place.&nbsp; I also tried install Intellitype 7.1 just for fun.&nbsp; With that installed, the media keys also stop working.&nbsp; As soon as I uninstall
 it again, they work.</p>
<p>So the question is, how do I get the PLAY/PAUSE button working in MC15 with the 1.05 drivers installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate - 64-Bit - Dual NICs - Dual Static IPs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zentsang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate - 64-Bit - Dual NICs - Dual Static IPs.</h2>
                    I'll start by saying I have the Asus Striker Extreme Quad-Core motherboard that is equipped with Dual Gigabit NICs (not wireless).&nbsp; I have 1 router which both ethernet cables are connect too.<br />
<br />
In Windows XP SP3 32-bit, I was able to setup 2 static IPs (192.168.xxx.50 and 192.168.xxx.51).&nbsp; This allowed for the router to redirect public internet traffic to a couple websites I run on my system, but keep my other personal traffic (LAN and Internet) separate.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, however, trying to make this change resulting in the system complaining.&nbsp; The first NIC setup as static with no problem to include the Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and DNS Server.&nbsp; Setting up the second NIC resulted in a disconnect
 and the system complaining that "Multiple Default Gateways are intended to provide redundancy to a single network.&nbsp; They will not function properly when the gateways are on two separate, disjointed networks. Do you wish to save this configuration?" Clicking
 YES and exiting the Properties screens back to the list of NICs, the Status column now displays "Unidentified Network" for the second NIC.<br />
<br />
Seeing how I rely on Static IPs ... one for the router redirects to my websites and the other for local Media Sharing with a PS3 and other systems ... this is a problem.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any direction?&nbsp; I am a computer tech so I can provide any info you need and I also understand all this stuff.&nbsp; No n00b here.&nbsp; =)<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Is "xxx" the same value for both static IPs?&nbsp; You don't have to conceal the actual IP addresses.&nbsp; They're private addresses, so they aren't accessible from the Internet.<br />
<br />
Did you specify the same Default Gateway for both connections?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you want to fix.&nbsp; Other than saying "Unidentified Network" for the second NIC, which might be just a cosmetic problem, is something not working?
<br />
<br />
I just duplicated your setup on my computer, specifying the same Default Gateway for both NICs, and everything seems to be OK.&nbsp; The IPv4 route table looks normal, and I can ping both static IPs from another computer.<br />

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enable both NICs, it appears to work; but hangs often; and some functions take an excessive amount of time.&nbsp; As soon as I disable one of the NICs, the work I was doing (waiting on)&nbsp;with the other starts running again.&nbsp; The two NICs are on different
 subnets, with what appears to be perfectly reasonable settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that Microsoft BROKE the stack and/or routing code in one of the recent releases; since I used to be able to do this as recent as a year ago with Win7-Pro and Win7-Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows a FIX to this, or which updates to back out, please respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            PROBLEMAS CON XBOX LIVE REWARDS</h2>
                    
<p>Ayer vi en mi cuenta que por la encuesta del mes me habian ingresado 20 puntos asi que imagine que ya se me habian desbloqueado los logros ya que me inscribi el 6 de octubre.</p>
<p>Me gaste 4000 puntos en un season pass y hoy miro a ver si me han puesto los puntos y sorpresa no hay nada, asi que miro lo de los logros y aun no se me han desbloqueado.</p>
<p>Despues de casi un mes dado de alta espero una solucion ya que me he gastado 4000 puntos y sin descuento alguno espero que alguien se ponga en contacto conmigo para que me lo den de una vez y me den el porcentaje que me corresponde.</p>
<p>Un saludo.</p>

            I have been having the same problem for several months on all of the accounts on the computer.&nbsp; Info:<br />
<br />
OS Version: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1, 32 bit<br />
Processor: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 5200+, x64 Family 15 Model 67 Stepping 2<br />
Processor Count: 2<br />
RAM: 4096 Mb<br />
Graphics Card: AMD Radeon HD 6570, 1024 Mb<br />
Hard Drives: C: Total - 152617 MB, Free - 92690 MB; D: Total - 280000 MB, Free - 248818 MB; E: Total - 280000 MB, Free - 279891 MB; F: Total - 393867 MB, Free - 346267 MB;<br />
Motherboard: ASUSTeK Computer INC., M2N4-SLI<br />
Antivirus: ZoneAlarm Antivirus, Updated and Enabled<br />
<br />
The Desktop Windows Manager Service is set to automatic and appears to be running after login. However, the event viewer regularly reports errors such as:<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: Dwm.exe, version: 6.1.7600.16385, time stamp: 0x4a5bc225<br />
Faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x0010ae2c<br />
Faulting process id: 0xea0<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01ce494b3ef37a04<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\system32\Dwm.exe<br />
Faulting module path: unknown<br />
Report Id: 7fbedfca-b53e-11e2-ae4a-0017315fb727<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have tried the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; sfc /scannnow - no integrity problems.<br />
2.&nbsp; Updated the motherboard BIOS - no change<br />
3.&nbsp; Clean boot - problem remains<br />
4.&nbsp; Updated the grfx card drivers - no change<br />
5.&nbsp; Booted from the Win 7 install disk, recovery tools - no errors reported<br />
6.&nbsp; System memory test - no problems reported<br />
7.&nbsp; Anti-virus scan - no issues reported from either AVG or ZoneAlarm tools (no, they're not both running at the same time)<br />
8.&nbsp; Restarting the WDM service - it immediately fails and redisplays the error dialog<br />
<br />
The only time the error goes away is in Safe Mode, but I assume that's because Safe Mode doesn't start that service anyway.&nbsp; I've also searched the internet for any other courses of action.<br />
<br />
Any further recommendations?<br />

<h2>            Trying to replace Windows 7 Paint with Windows XP Paint</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot stand Windows 7 Paint's lack of vertical space, so I'm trying to replace it with XP's Paint.</p>
<p>When I tried this, however, Windows wouldn't allow me to delete mspaint.exe, stating I needed permission from TrustedInstaller make changes to it. The exact message is as follows:</p>
<p>"You need permission to perform this action</p>
<p>"You require permission from TrustedInstaller to make changes to this file</p>
<p>"mspaint<br />
File description: Paint <br />
Company: Microsoft Corporation <br />
File version: 6.1.7600.16385 <br />
Date created: 7/13/2009 4:58 PM <br />
Size: 6.36 MB"</p>
<p>What can I do to get rid of mspaint.exe for good and put XP's mspaint.exe in its place?</p>

<h3> jrice9944  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I open all of my video files after uploading them from my iPhone 6&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't know why only some of my video files will open and others are unable to play when uploaded from my iPhone 6. I have Windows 10 but I was having this issue before updating to 10. Now, when I open File Explorer, only some of my videos open in the Movies
 &amp; TV app and the others have the Windows Media Player icon. The ones with the WMP icon are the video files that won't open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Movies &amp; TV app that automatically starts playing the video file:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4650557-b443-455e-999d-89dd5d824f12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4650557-b443-455e-999d-89dd5d824f12" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>When I try to play a video the Windows Media Player warning pops up and says:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The selected file has an extension (.AAE) that is not recognized by Windows Media Player, but the Player may still &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be able to play it. Because the extension is unknown by the Player, you should be sure that the file comes from a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trustworthy
 source. Do you want the Player to try to play this content? &nbsp;[Yes] &nbsp;[No]"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cea718aa-d7af-451c-b20b-93653be627e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cea718aa-d7af-451c-b20b-93653be627e9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I then click "Yes" which leads to another Windows Media Player pop-up saying:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; codec that was used to compress the file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef3a095c-ff62-41f8-8cc3-6771239e4fd6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef3a095c-ff62-41f8-8cc3-6771239e4fd6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not that knowledgeable in all things computer so I have no idea what an (.AAE) file is or what "codec" means. Ideally, I would like to have all of the Windows Media Player icon files to be able to open in the Movies &amp; TV app without having to download
 some other video player. If someone would be able to help me with this issue (and explain it in an easy to understand way) that would be amazing!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!&nbsp;</p>

            When i try to open it through iTunes it doesn't work. It just shows the iTunes menu. And I didn't want to download another media player because if &nbsp; I import some videos at the same time shouldn't all of them be able to play in the Windows Media Player
 and not just certain ones?

<p>Unfortunately I do not believe there are any microphones meant to be made standalone, with just the mic piece.

<p>But don't let that discourage you, I'm sure if you got creative you could cannabalize a normal microphone and tape it on your headphones or something like that. :)</p>

<p>It's epoxy, and I cut the part that fits on your head off.</p>

    <title>Using Skype for Business in a Company for Videoconferencing VS Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Skype for Business in a Company for Videoconferencing VS Skype &#34;Personal&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>We are trying to get a handle on how this works. &nbsp;Many of the people here have used SKYPE before (regular Skype) and have it installed on their laptops and systems. &nbsp;However, out Office 365 Business Subscription also includes SKYPE for Business. &nbsp;We are
 runing itno mucvh the same problems as we had with One Drive vs One Drive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one is really sure about what the difference is nor whether or not we can have meetings where we can invite people who are not part of our Office network/Domain? &nbsp;And if we do invite them, do we get charged for this when they join the meeting? &nbsp;Or do
 They? &nbsp;and if so, how does this "Charge" happen and how much is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one page of the Skype for Business setup i ran across a single mention of a $2 per User fee. &nbsp;But very little about why it is charged, or how it is charged or who gets charged. &nbsp; Can someone clarify this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: &nbsp;If we are holfing a video conference where we have 4 or 5 people who have Business accounts hosting a meeting where they invite 3 or 4 outside people who do not have Skype for Business &nbsp;.. or... DO have it but not with our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of the "Private User" can they join this meeting?</p>
<p>in the case of the Outside User who has Skype for Business at another company can they join?</p>
<p>And in both cases is anyone charged a fee for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to understand this arrangement compared to a WEB-EX session or some other similar setup.</p>
<p>We do participate in video conference and in the past have used our Tandberg or Polycom unit to accomplish the AV connections.</p>
<p>Those connections are now handled direct from smartphones in many cases without all the extra hardware and many of our employees have already been using SKYPE (regular) for this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The addition of SKYPE for Business has created a lot of confusion as well as created problems since it appears that the two applications dont necessarily use the same account names. &nbsp;As the icons are very similar (Just as the One Drive Regular Vs Business
 icons) people are never sure what can be done or which one to use as they have both and could use either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer an explanation for what choice would be best for company that has access to Both Business and Personal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    How do I access the screen where I can do the above? I've used it many times before in Windows XP and once in Windows 7, but I am unable to find it again. It's in the Control Panel.

    <title>Abbonamento gold con carta prepagata - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amusementfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abbonamento gold con carta prepagata</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao a tutti, nel mese di Aprile mi è scaduta la vecchia carta di credito prepagata con la quale pagavo l'abbonamento gold, ne ho acquistata un altra tramite banca inserendola come opzione di pagamento xbox nonostante non mi rimuovesse la precedente(dunque
 comparivano entrambe). Ora mi è stato disattivato l'abbonamento e ho notato che non compaiono i pagamenti di Aprile, Maggio e Giugno. Dunque deduco che continuassero a cercare di prendere il credito dalla carta ormai scaduta(che però non mi fa rimuovere).
 Come posso fare a ripristinare? Se vado su xbox.com/accounts e rimuovendo la carta scaduta mi dice che questa opzione non può essere fatta finchè non saldo il debito, ma se non posso saldare il debito dalla carta nuova che ho registrato come posso fare? Grazie
 a tutti</p>

            You should try to wait a bit. If it started out of nowhere (you haven't upgraded Flash player, browser etc) it might be that there's a problem related to the game itself. Developers of the game might fix it soon.

<h2>            Unknown system files in C&#58; drive</h2>
                    <p>Howdy geniuses,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert on this subject. In my computer, while I was examining my C: drive for disk space utilization, I noticed that there is a set of systems files with no proper name or description (screenshot below)&nbsp;taking up much of the disk space. Each of
 these files are of 200MB and there are about ~200 some files that takes up ~43GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone explain me what these files do and how to get rid of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b45947-7dc9-494e-b1c9-7f644427785b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b45947-7dc9-494e-b1c9-7f644427785b" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you didn't see my reply to Sumit, files are at the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
root</span> of the C: drive. Not inside a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your last statement, but I'm not a noob who'd mess around system files. What I want is to understand what are these and why the heck these take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. Only reason holding me back from deleting them is them being
 marked as system files.</p>

            <p>So I guess right-click properties didn't help at all. &nbsp;In that case you can try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Make an image of your system (C;) partition.</p>
<p>2- Delete or move or rename one or many or all of those files.</p>
<p>3- Restart your computer. Everything working well?</p>
<p>4- If everything is working well, run that way for a few days. Everything still good? In that case you can probably get rid of those files.</p>
<p>5- If everything is <em>not</em> working well, restore the image and you're back where you started. In that case, and if you're
<em>very</em> sure that you haven't been attacked, go through your applications and check the settings to see what might be creating those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no magic bullet that will tell you what creates those files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"Video remoting was disconnected" appears in VMConnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A further dialogue box appears stating&nbsp;"The connection was lost because another user connected to the virtual machine. Try to connect again. If the problem persists, contact your system administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you like to re-connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these issues&nbsp;seem to appear if I do not use Enhanced Sessions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read about&nbsp;Network&nbsp;card offloading&nbsp;being the potential&nbsp;issue so I've tried disabling this and&nbsp;it doesn't appear to help.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;before a real fix comes. You can click on your account very quickly when the machine starts up provided you dont have a password and it will log you in as that another user that is disconnecting you... No fix but a workaround if you need to use the enhanced
 session...</p>

            <p>This just started happening to me too with Windows 10 Pro host and various Win10 guests including a freshly installed virtual machine. I'm not sure what changed in the past couple of days to trigger this but I searched all over the place for a solution.
 It was your post that helped me try the "Enhanced Session Mode" option in Hyper-V settings and that works. I lose some functionality I was using but at least I can use the VMs. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I have worked around the issue. Just add a password to the local account on that virtual machine, it was kicking me out, because when the system automatically logged on once I connected to the virtual machine, it kicked my connection out. If I entered
 the password myself, it was counting it as one connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this help many people :)<br />

            <p>Hello, I just installed updates from November thru March of 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error message was another user was logged in and then the message changed to video remote not enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened command prompt as admin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the built in utility Quser /server:Yourservername(i.e. K.T. is fired) and obtained the session ids of the logged in users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used Logoff /server:Yourservername(i.e. K.T. is fired) (session id from quser)</p>
<p>bingo, I had a locked session on the vm and logging it off worked just fine. Did not have to add and re-add the feature, did not have to reinstall.</p>

                    Is there a way to change which port SKYPE uses? I believe it uses port 80 which is conflicting with another application I desperately need! Thank you.

<h2>            Windows fails to boot after freezing</h2>
                    <p>Please forgive any errors this is my first post here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello my desktop ssd recently froze. Nothing out of the ordinary it happens from time to time. When I restarted it failed to boot. I read up and I believe it it is an 0xc0000098 error. When I tried bcdbackup it also failed giving me an error that said "the
 volume was externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid" then I tried rebuild bcd. The scan came back with zero identifiable windows installations. I'm at a compete loss
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't make any changes recently or update windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't made a backup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the media creation tool to make an iso file on a USB which is how I got the 0xc0000098 error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.<br />

            Hi Maxwellingham
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi Max.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />

<h2>            Default File for XPS document</h2>
                    <p>Hi, how can I get the XPS printer to automatically save a file to say a default location without been prompted for the filename each time.&nbsp;I do not want code to do this for me as a 3rd party app is printing to the XPS printer and I have no control over this.</p>
<p>Prehaps there are registry settings for this ?</p>

<p><span>By design, you need to enter the file name when you are trying to print it.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, Well I'm actually working with 2 different OS's. XP SP2 .Net 3.5 and a WIndows 7 Ultimate .Net 4.0. Both appear to be the same in terms of printing options.</p>
<p>What I have looked at since, are 2 other products that act as a virtual type printer like XPS. Thats BullZip PDF and Zan JPEG printer. Both of these products have very good printer and Save options. Very very flexable indeed, down to options for where you
 want to save the file output too and to surpress all Dialog windows etc. I'm so suprised that the XPS printer does not have similer options. The downside to these products (from my point of view is) -&nbsp;BullZip is too slow !!! and with Zan the quality of their
 finished Images&nbsp;are not up to scratch for me, whereas XPS is perfect in both of these regards !!</p>
<p>Also I have come across the links you have sent on before, but these do not seem to have the answer I am looking for.</p>

            <p>..what I said about Zan is somewhat incorrect... there are loads of options in there to play around with the quality of the finished Image. BMP,Tiff,JPEg etc. Great product so I think I may be saying goodby to XPS printing, unless their printing options
 improve.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zan1011.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zan1011.com</a>&nbsp;-- its worth a look to see what a mean in terms of flexability and options.
