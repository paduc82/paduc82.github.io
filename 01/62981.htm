    <title>Bluetooth connectivity problems after patch KB4497934 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nekotaks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth connectivity problems after patch KB4497934</h2>
                    <p>This is my first post to this community, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently received the May 14 and May 21 patches for Windows 10 for my computer, KB4494441 and KB4497934, respectively, and Windows automatically updated to them. After the May 14 patch, I noticed that my PC wouldn't connect to any of my Bluetooth devices
 - my mouse, my Xbox One controller, my phone, and my laptop. Naturally, I unpaired and re-paired my devices to see if it would fix the issue. My mouse connected to my computer just fine, but my controller wouldn't pair back to my computer, and nor would my
 phone and laptop. The Bluetooth connection window would either not find my other devices even if they were in pairing mode, or would just outright not establish a connection at all to my devices and hang on the connection window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I assumed it was a driver problem, so I connected a non-Bluetooth mouse to my computer and went on to uninstall and reinstall the Bluetooth driver for my computer - no luck. It still had the same single device-only problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried manually disabling and reenabling the Bluetooth adapter in my computer via Device Managaer - still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried restarting the Bluetooth services on my computer - again, no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend told me to uninstall the most recent updates I did to my computer, which at the time was KB4494441, and huzzah - Bluetooth functionality restored, and all of my devices connected properly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the May 21 KB4497934 patch rolled out, Windows exhibited the exact same Bluetooth problems I was having, and so I also uninstalled KB4497934 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm close to simply doing a clean install of Windows, as even resetting Windows from the Recovery menu didn't fix this problem. I'd very much like to avoid this method, as I have difficulty finding time right now to do a clean installation
 of Windows to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem with the latest Windows quality patches? Would anyone know any other methods I can try to fix my Bluetooth problems before I try a clean installation of Windows with the newest patches already in place?</p>

            Hi NekoTaks
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You need not do clean install but can do repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>BSOD when entering hibernation or sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kroma&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD when entering hibernation or sleep</h2>
                    My Win7 x64 PC is (usually) crashing when entering hibernate or sleep (of the hybrid or non-hybrid variety).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I select Hibernate or Sleep and the monitor blanks (as expected). &nbsp;After about 5 minutes, the PC shows a BSOD and then switches itself off (I have only ever caught it in the act once). &nbsp;Usually, I'm only aware of what has happened when I restart the PC
 and I'm confronted with the option to 'Boot Windows Normally' or to use 'Safe Mode'. &nbsp;I have also seen it hang (before the BSOD) and manually shut down (by holding the power button) as I have been about to go to bed!<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yesterday was when I actually glimpsed the blue screen which mentioned 'Driver Power State Failure'. &nbsp;I also got an error dialogue when I booted back into the desktop.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I use Hibernate on a nightly basis and am now having to close/save documents and shut down (no errors shutting down as yet). &nbsp;We have two profiles on the PC and we generally keep both logged in. &nbsp;Obviously we can't
 do this if the PC keeps having to shut down and restart.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            Thank you for your help. &nbsp;Obviously I have been trying to solve the problem without either a repair install or clean install and would have used these as my final attempts.
<div><br />
<div>However, I have solved the problem after trying several things:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Firstly I checked my old event logs to find the first time that the error occurred. &nbsp;It was apparently back in March 2013. &nbsp;I checked which software had been installed or upgraded just before this and uninstalled. &nbsp;The problem remained.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then, as I was aware that the problem only occurred after the computer was left idle for some time, I played around with the 'screen turning off', 'screensaver' and similar settings. &nbsp;The problem remained.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then installed a new piece of software which added something to task scheduler. &nbsp;I then looked in task scheduler but was greeted with the following problem:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/error-messege-the-selected-task-0-no-longer-exists/01e60fa1-8004-40b4-9cf0-247fb80edb56">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/error-messege-the-selected-task-0-no-longer-exists/01e60fa1-8004-40b4-9cf0-247fb80edb56</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I repaired the problem by removing the offending task (there was only one offending task - a scheduled defrag event) and re-enabling it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, my hibernate/sleep/hybrid sleep works perfectly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After all of that it was a very simple solution - but a difficult problem to diagnose.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help.</div>

                    Hi! My taskbar is moved to the left side, that's how I like it basicaly. And when everything seems to be fine, Action Center on the right is pretty bad experience - having to move cursor all over the pleace to reach it. Is there a way to move Action Center
 to pop on the left edge, next to the taskbar? Edit register or something?

    <title>Is phone slam bluetooth different to laptop bluetooth&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heskencren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is phone slam bluetooth different to laptop bluetooth&#63;&#63; Bluetooth connection with nokia 215 only one way.</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have paired my 8.1 laptop with my Nokia 215 phone.</p>
<p>I can send MP3s to the phone from the laptop.</p>
<p>When I go to photos or sound recordings on the phone and try to share those back to the laptop it does not find or list the laptop. It displays "no devices found" even though they were talking fine just now. I repeated the attempt many times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It lists my son's old phone below which is deleted in my normal bluetooth pairing list.</p>
<p>I note that this is using bluetooth slam.</p>
<p>Is this a whole different thing to my laptop's bluetooth? I naturally presumed that they'd communicate in both directions in the same way that I presume my ability to receive an email based on my ability to send one. This is very annoying particularly as
 both the laptop and phone are of the same technology era. Is there a setting I have to alter somewhere?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So &nbsp;slam bluetooth is the same as my laptop bluetooth? </p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. My laptop is not left switched on so is started every time I use it.</p>
<p>2. I don't have or have access to a different bluetooth capable phone right now.</p>
<p>3. I have tried to update the driver on my laptop as suggested through device manager. It searched automatically online and reported that I already have the latest driver installed so no need to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble is, I have a load of bluetooth things listed (as below - under both &nbsp;"bluetooth" and "network adapters") including the phone (lord Cl) or so it seems and it likes to check the driver for that too. How does the laptop convey this driver to the phone?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't even know why it has so many different bluetooth entries there.</p>
<p>Can anyone please explain what each one of them does and which ones are relevant to my malfunction.</p>
<p>Also seeing as the bluetooth communication works in the laptop&gt;phone direction, which of those on the list relate to that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or... Is there anything else I might try?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            XPS 2710 stuck on black screen when powered on</h2>
                    XPS 2710 stuck on black screen when powered on. No way for a non-tech person to fix without wasting many hours and money. Since us consumers can never win over the right thing for companies to do to fix issues caused by there software or hardware, i forked
 over the $300 to Dell to replace the board and keep win 10 on the system. Lets see how many times they are willing to fix it after the same issue keeps occurring and i continue to send it in for repair over and over again in the 1 yr warranty that comes with
 the board. Let them waste there time and money! By the way its funny how the Dell service rep kept insisting that companies always do whats right for consumers, apparently he/they are smoking the best stuff on earth! "Consumer" is coined perfectly, "con" the
 "sumers" &nbsp;states it all when it comes selling and pimping bad products, than they claim they didn't know, or its not there fault, others are to blame when they get busted. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Programs cannot access documents in Libraries</h2>
                    <p>I am currently experiencing issues with the Libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use Windows Explorer, I am able to see all files that I have designated to be in the library document folder.&nbsp; Basically, this consists of including "My Documents" in the Library folder.&nbsp; If I desire to access any file I am able to double click on the
 file and the appropriate program will open the file and run normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, If I use the program and attempt to open the file directly, the program can not access the documents in the libraries.&nbsp; These programs include the Microsoft Office Suite 2010, Adobe Reader XI, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to create a new profile, scan for system integrity, removed any anti-virus software, etc and this did not have any impact.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Explorer can access the Libraries but not unique programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any solution?</p>

            <p>I'm assuming you using Open in an office program so you can search for and open a existing file ?</p>
<p>Adobe is a bit different because it's a freebie it might have restrictions as to what it can actually do for free ?</p>
<p>But in lets say office word,</p>
<p>I have office 2007 so the menus may differ,</p>
<p>I would click on the Office logo on the top left/ yours might be a Blue file button ?</p>
<p>Click on Word options or just Options,</p>
<p>You should see Save,</p>
<p>Then Default Save location what does it say and you can move the default save location so when you use Open it will go directly to that folder.</p>
<p>Report back,</p>

            <p>Thank you for the insight, however, the issue is that MS Office or any other program is not able to access the library file.&nbsp; A simple example would be in reviewing your instructions, attempting to change the default saving attribute, the program will identify
 within the library "My Documents" and "Public Documents" but will not allow the folders to be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, in the Document Library, as stated previously, the foleder "My Documents" does not all for the folder to be expanded or listed any documents that actually reside in "My Documents"</p>

<h2>            Paint Tool SAI - win 10 Jumping cursor, random clicks &#38; drag &#40;pressure pen&#41;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hello to anyone who uses a pressure sensitive pen to draw using paint tool sai on a windows 8/10 PC. I hope you're willling to extend some help. I just updated my windows&nbsp;8.1 to windows 10 and it has been driving me nuts whenever I attempt drawing in
 SAI. The cursor will work fine for a while and after clicking off of SAI onto the desktop or some file, upon returning to the canvas, the cursor will go crazy. It'll keep randomly dragging and clicking on everything. moving my pen away from the screen helps
 only temporarily. Even if I&nbsp;so much as just hover about half&nbsp;a cm from the screen, the&nbsp;pc detects contact and everything goes haywire. Please, please help if you have any useful suggestions. I've updated ALL drivers, and troubleshoot compatibility. Nothing
 helps. This is absolutely frustrating...

<h2>            Im really getting sick of Windows uptades</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone else expierience issues while using Windows 10 in games ? When windows 10 was released everything was fine but after few updates pc boot-up time went from 2 sec to like 5-7, games would randomly freeze, HUGE fps spikes. But it only happened like
 every hour or so so it was KIND OF ok. But now after the latest update doesnt matter what i do, watch movie, play games there is constant micro stuttering. My friend reported the same problem.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1a22b2f-d7a8-418a-8036-8738f53f896f" /></p>
<p>There is a constant cpu usage, mirco stuttering MICROSOFT pls if you cant make something that would work dont do anything... Far as i remember ever since windows xp updates would cause some problems but you were able to turn them off, now in windows 10 you
 are FORCED to download updates and bs that comes along with it.. My question is when is the next updated that will fix this problem it gets really annoying</p>

            <p>Perhaps you would be happier with a game console, like Xbox, which doesn't have to take into consideration requirements other than for gaming. Seriously, that's a major reason why these things are so popular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gamers who know their way around Windows typically disable and dismantle everything they can to get the best performance for their games. That's going to be much more difficult in Windows 10.</p>

            Well thing is Windows XP, WIndows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 worked fine. And with Windows 10 its problems after problems after problems... Looks like i found a problem it was something in Service Host: Network Serice (3) cant remeber what was it exactly
 but i disabled something with network location. Restarted pc and so far no problems. No more cpu usage nor mirco stuttering on ALL appliations (not just games).

 evolution of&nbsp;Windows; it's a new kind of Windows that's built to work on computers, phones, tablets and, heck ... toasters and refrigerators.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Added to that is Windows 10 is barely three months old and, like all new operating systems, has plenty of issues that will eventually get worked out. Nobody
 should draw conclusions about Windows 10's performance now. People forget that Windows XP didn't really shine until Service Pack 2.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>And lest anyone think that I'm some sort of Windows apologist, I've got plenty of problems with Windows 10, but they're not about its performance. A web browser

            <p>Dear Gene,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's easy to figure out what to close on the Applications tab because most of the names are easy to recognize, such as Quicken and Microsoft Word. Determining which processes you can safely stop is trickier. Click&nbsp;<i>Processes</i>&nbsp;to see a long list of open
 executable files. When you select one and click&nbsp;<i>End Process</i>, you're warned that this may crash your system. It probably won't, but save any open documents to disk before you try this just the same.</p>
<p>If you don't recognize a specific process listed in either Close Program or Task Manager, search your hard drive for the file name. That should give you a clue as to which program launched the process. Write the name down, and then click&nbsp;<i>Cancel</i>&nbsp;to
 exit Close Program. Select&nbsp;<i>Start, Find, Files and Folders</i>&nbsp;(in Windows 98),&nbsp;<i>Start, Search, For Files and Folders</i>&nbsp;(in Me and 2000), or&nbsp;<i>Start, Search</i>&nbsp;(in XP).</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<i>Windows</i>-<i>R</i>, type&nbsp;<i>msconfig</i>, and press&nbsp;<i>Enter</i>. Click the&nbsp;<i>Startup</i>&nbsp;tab, uncheck everything, click&nbsp;<i>OK</i>, and reboot your system. If that solves the problem, try rechecking programs on the Startup tab one at a time
 (reboot between each) until the problem recurs. When it does, you've found the source.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>J Chandrasekar.</p>

            <p><span>Hi WinUser1,</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Command Prompt with admin rights by typing cmd in start menu search box, right click and select “run as administrator.” Alternatively, go to All programs, Accessories, right-click on Command Prompt
 and then select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the command prompt, type
<b>Powercfg List</b> and then hit enter to see all existing power plans (schemes) and their GUIDs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, enter the following command to export a particular scheme:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Powercfg -Export Filename&amp;Location GUID</span></b></p>
<p><span>Replace Filename&amp;Location with any export location with <b>.pow</b> extension and GUID with the power plan GUID that you have obtained in the above step. For example, to export High performance power plan to your C drive you will type the following
 command:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Powercfg -Export C:\Highperformance.pow 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c</span></b></p>

<h2>            Demos on Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All, </p>
<p>Is it me or since Kinectimals was posted on the demo section there have either been very few games released to Demo, or that they have started putting already released games on there??</p>
<p>I was hoping to test Duke Nukem, just seems to me that it has gone very quiet on the demo front is all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>yeah i've noticed that too.. its quite sad that game companies don't really want people trying their games before purchasing them ..
</p>
<p>maybe because they now realise that demo's are actually concidered to be 10 X's worse than the actual game will be ..
</p>
<p>i keep looking at duke nukem, now i've never really been a fan of the duke-ster, but this 1 seems to appeal to me and i'd love to try before i buy...but to do that i've had to stick it on my lovefilm...which is sadly really

<p>There hasn't been many demos released in a long time. In fact, I've seen more demos released the past month than I've seen released in two years.</p>
<p>Just the way things work though, it's unfortunate but I am not complaining.</p>

<p>For Duke Nukem - just hold on. It's available for pre-order people right now, demo-wise. When the game hits store shelves, I think they'll be opening it up for everyone. (You need a special redeem-code right now.)</p>

<p>For all the other companies, it's probably because E3 is this week. Developers have been spending most of their time getting the new games show-ready, so focus on demos has probably been low. That's just a guess though, as I am not a console developer.</p>

<p>Just wait for the game to have been out already for 6 months or so, then you'll get a demo...**cough** &nbsp;Halo Reach and Modern Warfare **cough**</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that you're experiencing a blue screen with error. A blue screen with error occurs from different reasons.<br />
<br />
In this case, you've mentioned that you performed a reboot and your PC suddenly generated a blue screen. Aside from rebooting your PC, are there any recent changes you've done before the issue start?<br />
<br />
When you boot your PC, can you still reach the login screen or the screen immediately displays the blue screen with error?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to troubleshoot the blue screen error you're experiencing.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result of the troubleshooting. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>hi Michelle thanks for reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a brief blue screen the pc rebooted to login , i then logged in. &amp; looked in event viewer for windows logs&gt;system&gt;errors stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only hardware change/action/operation in question is a extended USB cable with a repeater.10 meters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certain this is the fault so i have removed USA extended cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is a new PC i decided to lookup errors &amp; found no results to error codes, so i posted here to check up with community. Hopefully it isn't my PC or &nbsp;I hope this incident didn't damage my mew PC</p>

            It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you know which update(s) present the error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (network, audio, video) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware manufacturers
 WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with video, audio or network don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates
 from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8c7bb8d-6949-4e03-bd66-eb28c2963c91" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/419c8508-eb59-47e4-8e0c-0582449cc6d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/419c8508-eb59-47e4-8e0c-0582449cc6d5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

            A Radeon video card is usually used for playing "games" and not graphic design software like AutoDesk.&nbsp; AMD (Ati) offers the FirePro graphics for workstations, which seems to be the "choice" for AutoCAD based softwares.<br />

    <title>iTunes bad image error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebeccmh  say:</h3>
<h2>            iTunes bad image error</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell Latitude D830 laptop operating on a 32-bit Windows Vista Ultimate system.
<br />
<br />
When I go to open iTunes I keep getting an error that says:<br />
iTunes Bad Image error<br />
C:\Windows\system32\cryptdlg.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator of the software vendor for support.
<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled and reinstalled it over 10 times, but I still keep getting this error. With the new 8.1 version of iTunes it will now open, but I get another error in addition to this one saying that a file that iTunes need is corrupted so the program may
 not work properly or communicate properly with the iPod. <br />
I have been checking iTunes forums where people have experienced the same error after updating their iTunes, but they have not found a solution for it. Even if you try reinstalling an older version of iTunes it still doesn't work since the file is corrupted
 now. Some have suggested downloading and installing a new cryptdlg.dll from dlldump, but since it is a system32 file it can't be edited.
<br />
I have also tried using registry repair programs, but nothing has worked. <br />
<br />
How can I fix my corrupted cryptdlg.dll file? or how can I access the system32 file so it will let me edit it so I can download a new one?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the SFC stated that it found errors that it couldn't correct you will need to an inplace install.&nbsp; The inplace install will reload all the windows files without affecting your other programs or data, however you need to do a&nbsp;backup before&nbsp;starting.&nbsp;
 What you will need to check is if your Vista media is at the same service pack level as your PC.&nbsp; Below are the instructions for how to perform the install.&nbsp;
<br />
**Make sure you do a backup of your system before begining the install.**<br />
<p><span>1. Insert the Windows installation disc into your computer's DVD or CD drive. You must start Windows installation while running your existing version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the <strong>Install Windows</strong> page, click <strong>Install now</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the <strong>Get important updates for installation</strong> page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and to help protect your computer against security threats. You will need an Internet connection
 to get installation updates.</span></p>
<p><span>4. On the <strong>Type your product key for activation</strong> page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.</span></p>
<p><span>5. On the <strong>Please read the license terms</strong> page, if you accept the license terms, click
<strong>I accept the license terms</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. On the <strong>Which type of installation do you want?</strong> page, click
<strong>Upgrade</strong> to begin the upgrade. You might see a compatibility report.</span></p>

If needed create a new Admin Account and copy your files to it.<br />
<br />
You can use the Built-In Admin Account to create your profile and to move<br />
files (however do not use this account on a regular basis because if it corrupts<br />
you are toast).<br />

How to Fix "You've been signed in with a temporary profile" Error in Windows 8 <br />
and 8.1 (Windows 10 is the same)<br />

<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a <br />
new one (remember to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except <br />
to test and fix).<br />
<br />
In&nbsp;the instructions of the link below use these instead of #3. Follow&nbsp;all the others<br />
under Work Group (if&nbsp;you are on a Domain you should be working with TechNet).<br />
<br />
3. In 8/8.1 and 10 use File Explorer -&nbsp;Click on the Drive where users are (usually<br />
C:\ ) - then View tab - tick Hidden Items box &amp; on far upper right of ribbon Options<br />
- Change folder and Search options.<br />
<br />
Fix a corrupted user profile &lt;- method works on Windows 7 and Windows 8<br />
- Windows 10 also.<br />
