<h2>            Windows crashes with error code 0xc000021a</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; I have had several machines crash that were recently re-imaged with windows 10 1703.&nbsp; I tried repairing with a recovery usb, restored to a known working point, used SFC /scannow, checked disk for errors.&nbsp; In the end I have to wipe and reinstall.&nbsp;
 All I have from the last crash are the Event Viewer logs and SRT folder logs.&nbsp; Please let me know if these are adequate in order to find the root cause of these crashes.&nbsp; No one else in our company is getting this error.&nbsp; We are using the latest version of
 Kaspersky endpoint security 10 for workstations and at one point there was an issue with the klvfs.sys driver causing these blue screens but that was about a year ago.&nbsp; Let me know how/where to upload the logs.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED or bug check 0xC000021A can be caused by mismatched system files or that the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS) has been compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. Since the bug check occurs in a user-mode
 process, the most common culprit is third-party applications in your device. If the error occurred after installing a new third-party application, the new software should be removed or disable to isolate the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that note, we suggest that you temporarily disable your third-party antivirus application and see if it still crashes when using the device. This is for us to identify if the issue is caused by a third-party antivirus application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it, you should re-enable it as soon as you’re
 done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player doesn&#59;t recognize my MP3</h2>
                    I have a computer that is running Windows 8.1 and just recently WMP has decided not to recognize my MP3 player (a Philips GoGear Vibe 4G.) It has worked before, and as far as I know it has all of the updates that it needs. It does recognize an external
 hard drive that I had connected to my computer, so I don't understand why it doesn't recognize my MP3.

    <title>IMPORTANT&#33; Microsoft Account Update Required to Avoid Interruption - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IMPORTANT&#33; Microsoft Account Update Required to Avoid Interruption in Service</h2>
                    
<p>I use auto-renewal. My account was (according to this site) successfully renewed on 8/01/2012. Yesterday, I received an e-mail stating that it was unable to charge my card the price for the 12 month subscription. BLASPHEMY! It renewed on the first of this
 month and my statement shows the charge from Microsoft Xbox Live. Now, a week or two ago I closed the bank account (after renewal) because I moved and it was not feasible for me to have a bank account with a bank so far away (we all hate surcharge fees at
 the ATM, right?). I don't understand why my account could get an interruption of service if it has been renewed and I've been charged for it.</p>

<p>While your account may have succesfully renewed, that does not mean it was actually paid on the same day. Renewing and Billing dates dont always match.</p>
<p>As Smwutches said, check you billing in the link he provided to see if the payment has actually been made or if its an outstanding balance due to non payment.</p>
<p>As you said you have closed your bank account, if you done this before the payment was due to settle, then you could run into issues like you are having now.</p>
<p>If the billing is not clear on teh websiote you can also ways contact support and ask them to look into it.</p>

<p>I'm having some problems finding the "pen and touch" menu on my windows 10.</p>
<p>I REALLY need to turn the pen feedback off, I can't draw properly with the circle popping up every time I hold the pen for more then 1 second. Please, how I can fix that without the " pen and touch" menu?</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for trying to help Joy Kemprai.</p>
<p>But the problem persist. In the "turn off pen feedback" window show this message "&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disables visual pen action feedback, except for press and hold feedback.<br />
<br />
If you enable this policy, all visual pen action feedback is disabled except for press and hold feedback. &nbsp;Additionally, the mouse cursors are shown instead of the pen cursors.<br />
<br />
If you disable or do not configure this policy, visual feedback and pen cursors will be shown unless the user disables them in Control Panel."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the press and hold feedback is the exact one I need to eliminate.</p>

    <title>Photos App won&#39;t open anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callista amara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos App won&#39;t open anymore</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, I was cleaning out my storage using the built-in storage cleaner on my Surface Pro 5 but ever since I did that, Photos has just stopped working. Whenever I tried to open a picture, I get an error message saying "The app didn't start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the solutions listed online so far, including system troubleshooting and using Command Prompt to scan for any errors (which they found none) to uninstalling (using Windows Powershell) and reinstalling the app again off of the Microsoft Store.
 My Windows is up to date as it just updated two days ago to the new 1809 version. I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me resolve this, it would be great.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Wait for an hour or two and if it doesn't come up, boot into safe mode and come out of that.
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try launching the Photos app again.

<br />
Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously.&nbsp; Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode.&nbsp; Restart once it's done and
 see if the system can connect to the update servers.&nbsp; If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode.&nbsp; Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.<br />

                    for some odd reason when I was messing with my wireless router my IP address changed to 169.254.11.200 and then wouldn't let me connect to the internet, I disconnected the wireless router and plugged my comcast wire directly into Windows 7 even though
 I did that and reset my Cable modem it still has the same IP Address and it won't let me on the internet, can anyone help me with this so I don't have to reinstall Windows 7

<p><br />
Hi musicmaster92 ,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for visiting&nbsp; Microsoft Windows Community site!</p>
<p><br />
I'd like to ask you few questions for better understanding :<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did this first start?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever been able to use the wireless?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you getting any error message that come up when you cannot connect wirelessly?
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What version of IE are you using? IE7 or have you upgraded to IE8?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried resetting your router? IF not try resetting your router.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To reset the router :</p>
<p>Next to the power supply connection there is a pinhole reset button. disconnect all cords from your router except the power cord. press reset button with a pin for 10 seconds. wait 10 more seconds then unplug router. Router will set to default settings,&nbsp;
 reinstall using software that came with router. you may have to reinstall network card software as well. then write your password on a piece of tape and tape it to your router.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You'd need to Disable IPv4 and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Disable IPv4:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try uninstalling IPv4 on all interfaces, removing any IPv4 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack. To remove IPv4, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4),
 that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.<br />
NOTE: You should do this for each network connection.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may want to try these steps first to narrow down on this issue : <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing&nbsp; Center &gt; Manage Network Connections.&nbsp; Click on each connection that is listed EXCEPT the wireless LAN connection and then click Disable this network device.&nbsp; Then see if&nbsp; your wireless LAN will connect.&nbsp; You
 will most likely have to run the Diagnose and Repair Utility from the Network and Sharing Center menu to force the wireless card to ask for IP information from the router.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If that does now work, then , go back into the Network and Sharing Center, Manage network connections and right click on the wireless LAN connection and select Properties.&nbsp; Then click on Internet Protocol version 4 and select Properties.&nbsp; Click in the box that
 says "Use the following IP address" and type in the information that was shown in the IPCONFIG report for your wired Local Area Connection above.&nbsp; Do the same for "Use the following DNS servers".&nbsp; Be sure you type the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway,
 and DNS addresses exactly the same as what the Local Area Connection had when it got the information from the router.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have you updated the firmware on your router? Vista has some problems connecting to some routers even when Windows XP can.
<br />
Are you getting an IP address on your Windows Vista computer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Go to a command prompt. Right click and choose, "run as administrator". Then from the command prompt, type in, Ipconfig /all. Then see if you have a valid IP address.<br />
Windows Vista cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft DHCP servers<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To resolve this issue, disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows Vista. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}<br />
3. In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.<br />
4. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br />
5. In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.<br />
6. Right-click DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.<br />
7. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br />
8. Close Registry Editor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By setting this registry key to 1, Windows Vista will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.</p>

<p>Hello Zephzill,</p>
<p>First, is the version of MYOB you are trying to install compatible with Windows 7? You can check with the Windows 7 Compatibility Center. Click<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Default.aspx?type=Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> for
 a link. You may have to upgrade to different version if not compatible.</p>
<p>You might try and copy the CD/DVD to the computer's&nbsp;hard drive. Next, find the .exe, right click on it and&nbsp;select "Run as Administrator". Then try the installation&nbsp;again.<br />
If that is not successful, then try and install MYOB in Safe Mode. <br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>

    <title>How to have PC boot to desktop then ask a password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lilgamingyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to have PC boot to desktop then ask a password&#63;</h2>
                    Basically I'd like my PC to load all the way to the desktop and load all programs that start automatically like it usually do but have it ask for a password if a program is launched manually. I'll keep details to myself but my roommate is not trust worthy,
 I have my PC set up to reboot itself after a power-outage and iSpy set up to launch on startup and to start recording on movement detection from my webcam.<br />
<br />
What I need is for my PC is to be securely locked even if it reboots but it needs to reach the desktop for iSpy to launch. So my 3 options are;<br />
1- Have the pc load up, type the session password (or bypass it) by itself, wait 2 minutes for everything to launch properly then do Windows Logo + L itself.<br />
2- What I describbed before. No session password, but one that comes up when a program is launched or a maybe even a keyboard key is pressed.<br />
3- Find a way to have the program boot before the desktop stage, I remember an anti-virus doing this a few years ago but it was programmed in it, it's not the case with iSpy.<br />
<br />
I will be away for a while during Christmas so I won't able to check on my PC and turn it on myself.<br />
<br />
Also, is it possible to have the PC do a check up to see if it is running and if it isn't to boot itself? I mean if my roommate turn it off by holding the power button the PC would eventually turn back on, if he unplugs it however that's a different story and
 at that point it'll be a different method used...<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: I'm not sure what category this would go in, if I picked the wrong one I am terribly sorry!

<p>Why does it need to reach the desktop for the "iSpy" program to launch?&nbsp; You should be able to start something without logging in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be able to change settings in the BIOS to start up every day at a given time.&nbsp; Password protect the BIOS as well and disable all external media bootables as well - or there's no point in any of this (although - unmonitored by external means with
 physical access without encryption: you may have lost already.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion: lock up the computer.&nbsp; Or - easiest fix: remove the hard drive and take that with you.&nbsp; Done.</p>

            If a PC boot up and stops where you select which session/user you want the programs don't launch, at least they never did with any PC I had, I can wait 1 minute or 5 hours, everything launches when I reach the desktop.<br />
<br />
Protecting the BIOs or leaving with the hard drive would be useless, he is not good with computers, I simply want to make sure that if the PC goes offline that it will be back online but I don't want him to have access to it.<br />
<br />
I will have the PC locked when I leave, I just need a backup plan if there is a power outage.

    <title>Кабель hdmi xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norphy sleepy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Кабель hdmi xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Доброго времени суток! Еще пару лет назад купил не задумываясь 1-й попавшийся hdmi кабель, им оказался кабель belkin который поддерживает все разрешения кроме 1080р, т. е. до 1080i включительно и скорость передачи примерно 6.7 гб, а теперь думаю не взять
 ли родной hdmi кабель(microsoft), т. к. меня не покидает ощущение, что качество графики из-за этого кабелино довольно паршивое (играю довольно редко поэтому раньше не парился по этому поводу). Будет ли качество картинки лучше c кабелем microsoft например при
 720р, чем с моим нынешним при том же разрешении? И еще вопрос, к моему монитору ViewSonic VX2451mhp-LED (full hd 1920x1080) лучше брать вышеуказанный hdmi или vga? И почему?
</p>

<p>HDMI - это технология передачи ЦИФРОВОЙ видео и аудио информации, потому "болезни" аналоговых проводов исключены полностью. Если проще сказать: нет, на качестве графики это никак не отразится.</p>
<p>Нифига не понял про 1080р, ибо с первой ревизии стандарта все оборудование изначально поддерживает 1080р (Собственно, статья в Вики для ознакомления:
<a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ru.wikipedia.org/.../HDMI</a>). Насчет желания заменить кабель, оно может помочь, конечно.</p>
<p>HDMI - передача сигнала в цифровом виде, VGA - аналоговое. Что предпочтительнее? Разумеется первое. Тем более, что великий и ужасный Гугл говорит, что разъема VGA ваш монитор не имеет.</p>

<p>Благодарю за ответы. По поводу того, что все кабели поддерживают 1080р, так-то оно так, но самое парадоксальное, то что на коробке от моего кабеля список доступных разрешений заканчивается именно на 1080i.</p>
<p>Монитор имеет разъем d-sub (тот же vga). </p>
<p>Моя заинтересованность кабелем VGA HD AV XBOX 360, отчасти, продиктована прочитанным отзывом о нем. Вот этим: "Для телевизора и монитора это лучше чем HDMI только если у вас full hd. По hdmi максимальные настройки графики только 1080p или 1680х1050. А по
 VGA можно выбрать 1920х1080, а это далеко не одно и тоже что 1080p. Но минус конечно в отсутствии цифрового звука, который идет по HDMI."</p>

<p>Прошу прощения, я не мега специалист по подключению приставок к мониторам, но процитированное сущий бред. Если монитор поддерживает отображение 1080p, то он будет отображать 1080p. 1080p и 1080i - это и есть 1920х1080.Если у вас отображалось 1080i, то разрешение
 вашего монитора было никак не меньше 1920х1080. </p>
<p>Да и не понятен смысл покупать VGA, чтобы менять произвольно разрешение - нахрена? Ведь все игры затачиваются под 720p (и потом апскейлятся до 1080), только некоторые под 1080p - тогда какой смысл делать нестандартное разрешение?</p>
<p>Поэтому советую не читать отзывы рандомных персонажей из Интернета, а просто почитать информацию о стандартах из Википедии + мануалы к Боксу и монитору. Тут дело либо в кабеле (скорее всего), либо в мониторе (например, особенности с отображением HD конкретно
 в 1080p - хотя, если монитор свежий, то это маловероятно).</p>
<p>Когда у меня при подключении приставки к телевизору по HDMI появился черный прямоугольник - я пошел в магазин и купил кабель с поддержкой HDMI ревизии 1,4a (телевизор и приставка его поддерживали). И с тех пор все норм.</p>
<p>Надеюсь, и у вас все будет в порядке.</p>

<p>Да, и про то, что изображение по VGA "лучше чем по HDMI" - это из разряда дискуссий о "тепловом ламповом" звуке грампластинок в сравнении с "бездушным пластиковым звуком" CD-проигрывателей.</p>
<p>У меня дома лежит кабель HD-VGA и я Бокс по нему подключал тоже к монитору. Правда, у меня монитор был 720p. После подключения к телевизору от разрешения 1080p кайфа не получил, а вот от качества изображения в сравнении с VGA было заметно.</p>
<p>ХЗ, может потому что я не гуру в стандартах видеоизображения и поэтому ничего не смыслю в "теплом ламповом" изображении с VGA-кабеля.</p>

<p>Сегодня ночью поиграл и понял, что-то срочно надо делать, ибо качество графы убого (квадратики в огне, дыме и не только, размытости, текстуры с промедлением обрабатываются). Может быть это из-за того, что я с флехи играю, но какая разница с другой стороны...
 в конце-то концов это может влиять только на производительность, не более того. Все-таки я склоняюсь к тому, что кабелино лажовый и попробую купить другой hdmi. Еще раз спасибо за столь подробные разъяснения =)</p>

<p>Понамаю, что совет "от капитана очеведность", но всё же..</p>
<p>В некоторых играх при игре с диска качество текстур на порядок хуже, для примера B3. Для которого желательно установить HD текстуры с диска перед игрой. Может быть это именно тот случай?</p>

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try and send the message goes into the Outbox.&nbsp; I wait and then try and resend.&nbsp; A few times eventually it sent but the message still stayed in the Outbox.&nbsp; Most of the time it does not send at all.&nbsp; My mail provider is a company called Livebooks.&nbsp;
 I spoke with them and re entered all the ingoing and outgoing details and addresses.&nbsp; Right now I am unable to get an error message for you because it keeps trying to send and is stuck on Executing.&nbsp; I saw a few different errors, long numbers and letters,
 0x800CCC0F, other ones I can not remember.&nbsp; After I post this I will restart my computer and see if I get an error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got one error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message could not be sent. The setting for your outgoing email [SMTP] server might need to be configured. To find the server settings for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***', please contact your email service provider.</p>
<p>Subject 'test 02'<br />
Server Error: 550<br />
Server Response: 550 Recipient Rejected: Relay not allowed<br />
Server: 'smtp.everyone.net'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC79<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 2525<br />
Secure(SSL): No</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been other ones in addition.&nbsp; I have also changed the port from 25 to 2525.&nbsp; Niether are working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Kim</p>
        </p>

<p>A 550 relay error means you are not directly connected to the server and they may be blocking port 25 especially if you are not hard wired to the router.</p>

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Comcast for my internet provider.&nbsp; When you&nbsp;say "they may be&nbsp;blocking port 25" do you mean Comcast?&nbsp; Or are you refering to my router?&nbsp;Could my router be failing, I am hard wired, or the Comcast cable box that has my bundle service of internet, tv
 and phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Comcast provides the internet service but I do not use them for my email.&nbsp; I go through a company Livebooks that hosts my website and email.&nbsp; They have a web based email that I route through Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; The web mail works perfectly. I am hard wired
 to my Comcast box directly.&nbsp; I have tried port 25, 2525 and 465.&nbsp; I just sent a message through yahoo mail and it worked but I can not get Windows Live Mail to send out at all.&nbsp; So yahoo and web mail all working perfectly just not Windows Live.</p>

            So Comcast is blocking only WLMail and not yahoo mail, gmail&nbsp;or my server web mail? Is that really possible?&nbsp; What code in the error message is specific to Comcast?&nbsp; I just know Comcast is going to say everything working on their end.&nbsp; Thanks so much for

<div>WLMail is an e-mail client. Yahoo and Gmail are Webmail programs and it's like&nbsp;comparing apples and oranges.&nbsp;I'd be surprised if you found a Comcast tech that knows the new 995 &amp; 465 port settings.

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with Comcast for the third time.&nbsp; FYI, Comcast is going to stop using port 25 for security reasons, hackers, they say everyone eventually is going to stop using.&nbsp; He said to try 587 and that one worked!&nbsp; Please pass on the info if
 you run across this in the future.&nbsp; It would have saved me days of frustration.&nbsp; Comcast should have notified all customers.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your time!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best, Kim</p>

            <p>I'm having a similar issue with my laptop. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is a brand new ASUS laptop with Windows 8.1.&nbsp;The resolution changes when I turn on the laptop after putting the laptop&nbsp;to sleep. The resolution of the laptop is fine when I turn on the computer after I shut it down. Once I put the laptop to sleep and
 turn it back on later on the day, the resolution has changed again, making everything a bit smaller (which also makes it hard to read when I'm searching for&nbsp;documents in my folder).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like the person who asked before, how can I keep the resolution the same?</p>

            i have exactly the same problem with since upgrading my Sony Vaio pro to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; After logging in after sleep mode the screen resolution appears high.&nbsp; The metro desktop contains twice the tiles, and applications are higher resolution, content on
 web pages for example is tiny.&nbsp; A reboot sorts it.&nbsp; Interestingly in display settings the resolution is showing correctly.<br />
<br />
Never did this on Windows 8 so its clearly a&nbsp; bug of somekind!<br />

            <p>Same issue with Vaio Flip after 8.1 upgrade - this useless suggestion of driver reinstall is of no help as that doesn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently this issue was there in Vista which has come back - I guess code source control issue!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you put you computer to sleep while screen saver or the login screen is NOT on, it works fine - in other words put your computer while you can see desktop on your computer and then it is all fine.!&nbsp; Even though IE magnifier still switches to 225% from
 default 150% but that is lot less annoying to fix.</p>

            <p>Hello Sharief K,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this same problem. I must shut down my ThinkPad Ultrabook before plugging it in to my docking station or else the screen is fuzzy.</p>
<p>Do you mean to download the drivers from the computer manufacturer or the screen manufacturer?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
        </p>
