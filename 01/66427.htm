    <title>Start Button Not Working After Version 1151 &#40;OS Build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadhead312  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Button Not Working After Version 1151 &#40;OS Build 10586.164&#41; Update</h2>
                    <p>My computer updated to Version 1151 (OS Build 10586.164) yesterday morning.&nbsp; After the update, my computer ran very slowly and it seemed as though no matter what I opened up (MS Word document, web browser, etc.), they all ran slowly or simply froze up.&nbsp;
 When it froze up, the only way to turn off my laptop was via a hard start.&nbsp; It seems to be running better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my Start Menu button is not working.&nbsp; If I click on it, nothing happens.&nbsp; The only way to do anything with it is by right-clicking on it and even then I only get a very limited menu (see picture).&nbsp; Is there any way I can fix this?&nbsp; Many thanks in
 advance!</p>

<p>In my case the start &amp; windows buttons dont work , but worse, the task bar has disappeared, cortana bar doesnt work, none of my deskop icons/shortcuts work.</p>
<p>MY pC has been rendered almost useless (again). I can only get anything done by starting the task manager - the ONLY thing I can start.&nbsp; Absolutely intolerable!!!</p>

    <title>All USB ports not working after changing graphic card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cohlint  say:</h3>
<h2>            All USB ports not working after changing graphic card</h2>
                    <p>I had tried many solutions found from internet, but none had solved my problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a new PC two months ago, Windows 8.1 Pro + Asus B85M-G + i7-4790 3.60GHz + 8gb RAM + 500W PSU and etc. It works fine until I changed&nbsp; a new graphic card two days ago, from old Sapphire Radeon R7 250 to new Sapphire Radeon R9 280.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem is, whenever the computer go to Windows login screen, all the usb ports in my CPU stopped working.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At first I thought maybe I accidentally broke something while inserting the new graphic card, but after several testings, I found out that all USB ports are worked fine before Windows. Like press F8 before BIOS, or select options in BIOS, my USB wireless
 keyboard and mouse are working fine. But as soon as the system loads the Windows, my keyboard and mouse will not respond at all.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I have a USB bootable pendrive of Windows 8. While in Boot option after pressing F8, the system did detected this pendrive and allowed me to choose it. Everything points out that all the USB ports worked fine until loading the Windows.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did tried plug in a PS/2 keyboard, which allowed me to type in logon password and go into Windows;<br />
</p>
<p>I did tried switch my USB receiver of my keyboard and mouse to every other USB ports;<br />
</p>
<p>I did tried uninstall all USB ports to let Windows reinstall drivers;<br />
</p>
<p>I did tried shut down my computer and unplug all my USB devices;<br />
</p>
<p>I did tried shut down and take out the motherboard battery for a while then put it back and switch on;<br />
</p>
<p>I did tried reinstall Windows, format C: to perform a clean install;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But after all the methods above, the results are same: all the USB ports still not working. One weird thing is, only my USB fans worked fine. Maybe because it just need power from USB port.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one time, I did tried changed back to my old graphic card, but the problem still remains, not like the good old time anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one thing to notice, after boot into Windows 8 installation screen by using F8, it didn't detect my keyboard and mouse either, but PS/2 keyboard works fine, which means the USB ports still not working in boot screen. This is important as will be compared
 to situation below.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I can't figured out where is the problem lies, a weirder thing happens during a blindly testing: Instead of using Windows 8.1 Pro boot disk, I try using a Windows 7 Home Premium boot disk.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unlike Windows 8 installation screen, the Windows 7 installation screen detected my USB wireless keyboard and mouse! I can use the keyboard and mouse normally in Windows 7 installation screen. So, I format C: once again but this time, I install Windows 7
 Home Premium. As the installation complete and go into Windows, all my USB ports works fine.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Seeing the USB ports works fine under Windows 7 Home Premium, I try one more thing: reinstall Windows 8.1 Pro, but this time I choose Upgrade, which means keep all the settings, or so we're told in this option description. Sadly, after the upgrade installation
 complete, the USB ports not working again.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And now, as I'm using back Windows 7 Home Premium, open the browser, and using my USB wireless keyboard to type this post (oh, I connect to internet by using USB Wireless Adapter too), just to ask: Anyone know how to solve this problem? Although now the
 Windows 7 works fine, I still like to use Windows 8.1 back.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To summarize my problem:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Everything normal, until changed a new graphic card.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While still Windows 8.1 Pro:<br />
</p>
<p>1. All USB ports worked fine in BIOS, before loading to Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>2. All USB ports not working in Windows, had tried uninstall USB ports in Device Manager.<br />
</p>
<p>3. All USB ports not working in Windows 8 Boot Screen.<br />
</p>
<p>4. All USB ports not working even after format and reinstall Windows 8.1 Pro.<br />
</p>
<p>5. All USB ports worked fine in Windows 7 Boot Screen.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 7: After format and installed Windows 7 Home Premium, everything works fine, haven't found any problem related USB ports.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not native in English, I had tried so many methods these two days, maybe I missed out something, but hopefully my description is understandable.<br />

            <p>It is possible a third party&nbsp;USB filter driver&nbsp;may be causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1 can you check the following registry key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>At that registry key, in the right window, is there&nbsp;a "Name"<em>&nbsp;UpperFilters</em> and/or
<em>LowerFilters</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what is "Data" for those Names?</p>

            <p>Thank you for replied, but I'm sorry I can't check it right now because I had deleted my Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't go through the installation again as I just set my Windows 7 back to my comfort setting, unless it's a sure solution. But maybe someday later, I could try make a new partition to install the Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, very sorry I can't test it right now, after two days of frustration, I'm kinda tired and lazy...</p>

            <p>It's been 5 months late, I'm almost too embarrass to reply at all, but I think I need to write something for closure.<br />
</p>
<p>I did try clean install before, format C: before install windows and such, but same problem still occur ever since I changed the graphic card. And I did check the registry key this time, only
<em>UpperFilters</em> and the data is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this time I success. Kinda. Sort of. Maybe called it a bypass?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I started again because I want to upgrade to Win 10. But the problems remain, USB not working in Windows 10 installation setup. As I feel frustrated seeing Win 10 met the same problem, I give Win 8 one last try. There's a reason why I choose Win
 8 over Win 10, but that's not important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I kept Win 7, make a partition for Win 8, install the Win 8 by using PS/2 keyboard, and go inside Windows 8. I try find that registry key, repeat any idea what I thought before, uninstall USB port and such. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of that, I found a way. Simple, shut down the computer, unplug the PS/2 keyboard, plug in USB keyboard and mouse, then power the computer back on. Before that, I still kept the PS/2 keyboard plugged after installation, maybe that's why I never
 found out until now, or maybe something I do this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, now I can boot the Win 8 normally, and the USB ports work fine. But, this way is not 100% working. During several times restarting computer for windows update, sometimes the USB ports will not working again. But shut down and open up again, there's
 a chance to boot the Win 8 with USB ports working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, I still don't know what cause this, I didn't actually solve the problem, but at least I can bypass the problem, for now.</p>

</p><p>The registry key is fine but from what you described the problem may be hardware. Did you ever check for a BIOS update ?</p>

            Hi  PontiacGTX1
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />I noticed you are still on Windows 10 1809, try upgrading to Windows 10 1903 to see if it resolves the problem. 
<br />
<br />Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a>

            Resetting the driver with the key shortcut doesnt work I will try reinstalling the drivers and looking for upgrades but I recall I had fixed the problem in a certain way, this problem didnt exist in 1709 before

            I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<p>Under Win7 RAID working without any problem. When i upgraded to Win10, i have some "smileys screen"&nbsp;</p>
<p>in setup Win10... When i unplug a DVD drive i can finish install but both drives in RAID are spinning</p>
<p>up and down in every 10sec as they are fault... But SMART they recognizes as good without problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i deleted an upgraded instalation and i installed hole new clean instalation... Its trully same...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i moved them to Marvell 9128 controller, it works much better, but sometimes system is unstable,</p>
<p>without any cause. When i switch off hole RAID controller, system is stable without problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is:</p>
<p>Xeon X5670</p>
<p>Gigabyte X58 UD5 &nbsp;ICH10R</p>

<p>OCZ SSD drive</p>
<p>Samsung 2x1TB HDDs in RAID 0</p>
<p>Gigabyte R9 280x&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided as fault of bad driver in BIOS of motherboard and its end of this problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today i want to make RAID 0 with two new Seagate drives in my HTPC...</p>
<p>When i plugged this two drives into HTPC and setting them into RAID 0, the hell will come again... :(</p>
<p>Trully same behavioring like in previous PC... Drives spin up spin down and system is unstable with many smileys screens...</p>
<p>

<p>Gigabyte R9 280X</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thing, problems are in Windows 10 Driver, because i havent any problem on Win 7 or Win 8.1...</p>
<p>I finding this problem on the internet, but i cant fing any same problems from other users...</p>
<p>Thats weird, but if two different PCs are behaving same, its will be a problem somewhere in system...</p>

<p>There is not really a easy answer for this. Some games I have played have used as little at 10mb per hour, while others I have seen it in the 40 to 50mb per hour useage. That is just playing games, not using netflix, hulu, even party chat. The best bet would
 be check your date useage before playing and double check back after your playing. Most phones have a # code you can enter to check your useage. Using an android phone there are many apps on the market to keep track of the data.
</p>
<p>Just becareful as going over your bandwidth can be very costly.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have done alot of research on this topic and found it to be really wishy washy. With that being said here is what I have found.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With a 4g connection many people say that you will need to worry about your ping back, and others say its your bandwith not your ping that suffers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Verison says that 4 hours of online gaming will take up 600mb of data, but also says that online gaming averages 5mb an hour so that 600mb for 4 hours seems strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Online, the most common answer seems to be 50mb an hour with no demo, tv, hulu, esc. just gaming with no chat. Chat seems to be a more costly option but that one does not have a real answer of actual data usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So this subject is an ongoing battle with an uphill climb. Good luck.</p>

                    Someone else set up my computer,&nbsp; They say they didn't enter any user names or passwords.&nbsp; The first thing I do is&nbsp;CTR ALT DEL and then I enter my username and password to log onto the server at my job.&nbsp; My problem is that I can't make any changes such
 as Windows Auto Updates,&nbsp; It keeps asking for a higher lever username and password.&nbsp; How do I change this?&nbsp; I'm thinking I was never set up as the administrator on my computer but I can't get beyond the request for higher level info.

</p><p>The blocking usually happens when you are signing in to your account using a new device, a new internet connection or if you are using a VPN. Using either of these will trigger an unusual activity with your account.&nbsp;You will still need to verify it through
 your phone number&nbsp;in order to release it from the restriction. As an alternative, you may want to download the Microsoft Authenticator app. This would greatly help secure your account and prevent any&nbsp;restrictions&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;Search the Microsoft Authenticator
 app through your&nbsp;Apple app Store. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Rene Englehart,<br />
<br />
Ensure that you have downloaded the correct and complete setup package for your computer</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A&nbsp;<strong>JAR</strong> file (or&nbsp;
<strong>J</strong>ava <strong>AR</strong>chive) aggregates many files into one.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Try
 to install the program as administrator - Right click on the Firefox installation files (Setup files)<span>&nbsp;</span>and select&nbsp;<strong>run as administrator
</strong>,click on <strong>continue </strong>if prompted for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to post your query on Firefox forum<br />

<p><span>Regarding Windows 7 installation<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>There are two options to choose from during the&nbsp;<span><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></span> installation process:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Upgrade</strong></span></span><span>: This option replaces your current version
 of <span><span>Windows</span></span> with <span><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></span>, and keeps your files, settings, and programs in place on your computer.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Custom</strong></span></span><span>: This option replaces your current version
 of <span><span>Windows</span></span> with <span><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></span>, but doesn't preserve your files, settings, and programs. It's sometimes referred to as a&nbsp;<span><span><em>clean</em></span></span>
 installation for that reason.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>It is recommended to backup data before performing any installation.<br />
<br />

                    <p>I&nbsp;have just turned my Xbox back on and it wasn't connected to Xbox live i try to connect it nothing happened i went into settings tried to go into network settings and couldn't even do that no error or anything i found a bypass to that just by plugging a Ethernet cable in and restarted. But then i still had the issue of trying to get into network settings then i came across another issue as i was preparing to move my games to a portable hard drive ready to factory reset then&nbsp;i click move all &amp; tried copy all and nothing happened same as my issue with network settings so i went to a individual item&nbsp;&nbsp;pushed start clicked move then that is where i got the error code:&nbsp;0x8000000e so if there is any reason or solution for this please comment would be good to know and even for others who come across it in the future.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just want to note it was fine 4 hours ago i'm using a Xbox one X&nbsp;and my standard Xbox one has never had this issue&nbsp;</p><p

    <title>Why does my internet disconnect exactly every hour&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tethramm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my internet disconnect exactly every hour&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I am using a Satellite p855-s5200 and I have Windows 7. Every day, I have been getting disconnected from the internet (wireless connection) exactly every hour. For example, I'll get disconnected at 2:00 PM and then the next disconnect will happen
 at 3:00 PM, or if the first disconnect happens at 5:57 AM, the next one will happen at 6:57 AM, etc. Some days, it won't happen at all. This is only happening for my computer, there are many other people in my house on the same router using the wireless internet
 that do not get disconnected like I do. The disconnects last for 5-10 seconds usually, a yellow and black warning sign appears over my internet bars and under the name it says "Unidentified Network". And the then warning sign disappears and it goes back to
 "Internet Access". Rebooting my computer will help but only for a day. Someone help.

            I can't remember anything done to my computer prior to this problem, but I do have a feeling I may have some mini-virus that's causing this problem. I viewed my Network Adapters in the Device Manager and I have two drivers (Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport
 Adapter and Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter #2) that say "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software" when I try to update them. They are both dated back to 2006. The warning it gave me convinced me that uninstalling these two adapters
 would be a good idea, but after I uninstalled and rebooted, they reappeared. I don't know what they are. My other network adapters are Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2200 and Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller both up-to-date. Would it be worth factory resetting?
 I havn't troubleshooted yet because I don't know what to do. I will be reading the links you provided.

            An interruption on such a precise schedule is not at all typical of a driver problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Check Task Scheduler (Control Panel / Administrative Options / Task Scheduler) for a task scheduled to run hourly and report what, if anything, is found.<br />
<br />
Also, check thorooughly for malware.&nbsp; Use the good free programs below in addition to a scan with your resident anti-virus program.<br />

<h2>            Turtle Beach Stealth will work on Xbox 360 not just Xbox One.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone it's Friday afternoon and you could say pretty much the weekend now for Australians and New Zealanders.</p>
<p>I got some good news. Turtle Beach Stealth 500X WILL work on Xbox 360, NOT just Xbox One! I spoke to turtle beach support they said the headset will only work on Xbox One. But they were wrong because Xbox 360 also has optical out and I'm getting dolby or
 DTS sound on my headset and I attached the chat cable I used for my Turtle Beach X42 and I can talk and hear with peps on Xbox 360. I'm happy. I ordered it through MightApe this morning and I just got it by express courier this evening. I haven't tested it
 yet on my Xbox One console. I'm going to continue exploring the features of my new headset this weekend. I also contacted Xbox Support this morning before going out, and they said Xbox 360 supports DTS 7.1 surround sound even though on this site, it says Xbox
 360 supports DTS 5.1 and doesn't list 7.1. But I know on Xbox One you won't need the chat cable, but for Xbox 360 you will, because the headset wireless chat component is meant for Xbox One. But I'm happy it works. Some say the headset also works on PS4 but
 again like Xbox 360 to chat, you need to attach a chat cable. Otherwise it's advertised to function completely wirelessly on Xbox One.

<p>Another reason why I wanted to announce this is because really no one yet has announced clearly if it will work on Xbox 360 not even on YouTube or google.

<p>I already saw a similar video. &nbsp;I first turned on display mirroring on my Fire TV &nbsp;stick.</p>
<p>My TV displayed the message waiting for display to mirror (to the TV). Then on my HP laptop, I tried to mirror the display to my Fire TV Stick. &nbsp;but I couldn't do it because my device doesn't support Miracast. &nbsp;Why is that? &nbsp;Does Miracast need hardware support
 to run? &nbsp;Or could my Windows 10 be updated with some optional component to make Miracast work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there some other way to do this?</p>

<p>Ok I have done some experimenting with my 2 Roku devices which would be very similar to your Amazon Fire TV Stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Build 16299.64 neither on of my Roku devices work and I get the same "<span>Windows 10 software, doesn't support Miracast." message you get.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But on my Insider Build I could connect and Mirror or Cast The computer to the Roku 4k but not the Roku Streaming Stick I guess it needed to be the&nbsp;</span><span>Roku Streaming Stick + to have that capability.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it looks like you should be able to do this after you get the next Windows 10 public Release when it comes out in the Spring.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Took a photo of the Roku screen. The resolution is not the same as my computer screen so I can't see all of the Taskbar at the bottom.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And below this one is a Screenshot that I had to resize so it could be Uploaded. It is much clearer.</p>

<p>This one below is in Extended Screen Mode so it just looks like one large Screen.</p>

<p>I think the reason you are having problems is because Amazon FireTV does not longer support Miracast connections from Windows based PC systems! Their website states that only devices running Android and FireOS are supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was possible for Windows PCs earlier, but this was removed with one of the latest updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have a reference to the german Amazon website where you can see the table in the middle listing the supported platforms:</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, note that "download" is really not an appropriate word. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving files from one drive to another is no different from moving them from one folder to another folder on the same drive. There are several ways to do it. Here are the two most common:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Cut and paste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open both the source and destination in two instances of Windows Explorer (or My Computer) and drag and drop from one to the other.</p>

            <p>Hi Smit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, let's reboot the computer in <span><strong>safe mode</strong> with networking and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Safe mode</strong> is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some third party
 programs conflict. The word Safe mode appear in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps given below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Unplug external devices connected to the computer expect<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>keyboard</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>mouse</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>From login screen, press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Shift key</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and click on the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Power button</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>restart</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 enter Advanced Boot Options.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>In this page select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>troubleshoot<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong>option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>And click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Advance option</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Startup setting</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from advance option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Here you will find Restart button, just click on it.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In new windows press F5 to login with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>safe mode with networking</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>

Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you logged in to safe mode with networking, perform System restore and check if this helps in resolving the issue. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install
 a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/e6bbddb0-9db4-4d88-9063-42c52c79a96e/create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a restore point manually.</a><span> Restoring
 won‚Äôt affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click (or press and hold) the Start button, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
