    <title>Cancelling of Xbox live subscription. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> resarf08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cancelling of Xbox live subscription.</h2>
                    
<p>Won't be using xbox live again or buying any xbox related products, the system you have in place to cancel xbox 360 live subscription is pathetic. First off the idea that you would keep charging us until we tell you to stop renewing comes off as money grabbing
 not convenient. I had to log into my account on my computer because I could not cancel over the actual xbox - which by the way is where I purchased my subscription. I dunno maybe a little consistency here in allowing us to cancel through the same machine we
 purchased from would be easier for the customer.Once logged in I then had to validate my account for security purposes and was given two options A) validate through secondary email and B) validate via phone, I decided to validate through email but surprise
 surprise I couldn't. Turns out that you cannot log into your xbox live account and a secondary email account at the same time if that email is Hotmail because you will be kicked off your xbox account. So when you sent that validation code to my secondary email
 and told me to validate while I was logged into my xbox live account you were really just toying with me huh?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The only alternative was to validate via phone, got the code and thought ‚Äúfinally I'm done‚Äù. Until I tried to enter it and got told I had to wait 30 days for you to process the unfathomable change from me wanting to get this code through my phone instead
 of email. However there was a work around for this ‚Äì I logged into my secondary email through a secondary computer and got the code there and went back to my main computer and typed it in. So just to summarise this long winded complaint, I could purchase my
 subscription through my xbox with little hassle but to cancel it I had to wait 30 days or had to have two computers and couldn't do it through the xbox? Is this some scheme to make it difficult for me to cancel so you can get a bit extra money or hope I would
 give up? I realise that for individuals who had a secondary email that was not Hotmail it may have been easier but I don‚Äôt remember any warning about this.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That‚Äôs just cancelling the subscription, in order to complain about this issue I had to sit and wait for a customer service rep to give me an email because I couldn't find one, waited through the queue which was 10 people and that took a good 20 minutes.
 Then when I actually got in touch with your rep it took him a further 15 minutes to produce an email to complain to‚Ä¶oh wait he didn't give me an email he gave me a survey link which couldn't fit this complaint in. I dunno maybe your own rep couldn't find a
 proper complaint section either and which is why I'm complaining here.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I don't really care for consoles any more but I can see why PS4 has stole the hype - they seem to listen to their customers.</p>

<p>When you subscribe using your xbox auto renewal is automatically selected for you by Xbox live. There is no option for a one off payment on Xbox live without of course getting a card in a store. However like I said in OP if you do not get a card it raises
 many issues that shouldn't be raised, this isn't the customers fault and it's interesting that this seems to be the general opinion of repliers. This is quite obviously if you read my entire post horrible design on the part of Microsoft that seems more than
 anything to be a money making ploy.</p>

<p>[quote user="Resarf08"]Is this some scheme to make it difficult for me to cancel so you can get a bit extra money or hope I would give up?[/quote]</p>
<p>I would say the auto renew function is dubious, but the rest is simply for security.
<br />
<br />
I used to get those security codes texted to my phone, but when I lost my phone, I lost access to my account. And yeah, it would have taken 30 days to change the verification method. In the end however, I contacted support and linked a new e-mail address to
 my Xbox account, and with it, an entirely different verification method, all without the wait.</p>

<p>Then I shutdown and rebooted.</p>
<p>Lost mine (Admin) screen . ALL BLACK again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cancelled out of this with your suggestion to get to advanced Options and reverted back to a previous version. SO no further ahead.</p>
<p>Two accounts still not accessible with BLACK screen with cursor.</p>
<p>Can see the desktop after sign-in in safe mode but not usable at that resolution as you would agree.</p>

 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples of what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Text-to-audio</p>
<p>make a file with notepad that I add to the startup directory and it would greet me and tell me the time as audio.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Not Yet Ready for Prime Time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webstuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Not Yet Ready for Prime Time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>At least on my Windows 8 tablet (Lenovo ThinkPad 2), the upgrade to 8.1 has been immensely disappointing, and I was looking forward to it so much! The most noticeable issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The startup time went from amost instantaneous when I flip open the cover to taking 3-4 seconds. This is quite horrible side-effect of the upgrade.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;My music library in Xbox Music disaapeared.</p>
<p>3. The Mail program seems to have stopped working reliably. It is not updating consistently, and seems to get stuck in the "Syncing" mode. Although the live tile updates to show new mail, the app itself never updates. In addition, the "Delete" mail function
 simply does not work. Awful!</p>
<p>4. The screen resolution resets randomly on its own to a lower resolution. Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the upgrade, this device was working very reliably and I was very happy with it. Now I'm tempted to simply stop using it, as it has become a hassle and is no longer reliable or very usable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that Microsoft would have done such an incomplete job of testing and debugging such a hugely important software release. Please MS, fix these issues immediately and release an update within the next few days! I'm one of the legion of
 loyal users that WANT to love and use Windows devices, and for me, Windows 8 was a wonderful product. For the first time I was able to use and sync five Windows devices (office desktop, home desktop, laptop, tablet and phone). Now I feel handicapped and betrayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the Xbox Music app has some nice improvements, but it has had much of what I loved about the Windows 8 version of the app ripped out. Why can't new features be added WITHOUT removing features that we've already learned to use and love? I miss
 the old Now Playing screen, with the rotating images of the artist, a full list of all the albums from the artist, a biography of the artist, and a list of similar artists. From what I can see so far, ALL this is GONE? I LOVED those features!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as you can see, I not at all satisfed at the moment with Windows 8.1. Hopefully I get used to having lost features that I loved, and learn to love feaures that have been added.</p>

            <p>I was able to fix the issues that I initially encountered. In case anyone else runs into this upgrade issue with the ThinkPad 2, here's what I had to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Renistall Windows. This removed 8.1 and reinstalled 8.0.</li><li>Update Windows with the latest 8.0 upgrades and patches. This took 4-5 separate updates and restarts, but just keep doing it until there are no more updates available.</li><li>Update Lenovo files. Search for "system update" from Lenovo and run that. This also took multiple attempts in order to get all of the Lenovo files updated, including the system update app itself.</li><li>Go to the Store in 8.0 and run the Windows 8.1 Upgrade again. I turned off the "sleep" function for when the machine is plugged in so that it didn't cause any weird file corruption issues. This process took quite a bit of time, as it seemed like the upgrade
 server may have been loading down a bit.</li><li>After 8.1 installed and the initial setup ran, update all of the Windows apps. Go to the Store, select "settings" and then App updates from the charm menu, then "sync licenses" and then "check for updates."</li></ol>
<p>I had one weird issue remaining, which was the fact that my Photos app broke in the process of completing the upgrade. I had to restore the default libraries and then restart the ThinkPad again in order to ultimately get that fixed. I think I now have a
 fully functional ThinkPad 2 running Windows 8.1. The only thing that DIDN'T get fixed is the 3-4 second wakeup time. I'm hoping that perhaps Microsoft can address that in a future minor upgrade? To quote the Beach Boys: "Wouldn't it be nice."

            Oh, FWIW, I did finally find most of the Xbox Music features I was missing. It seems all but the Artist Bio were there but moved to be below the fold instead of to the right as they were on the Windows 8.0 version. The bios were a great feature and I don't
 know why they decided to remove them. Or perhaps they're still around but moved someplace I haven't found yet? Once can hope. :-)

            <p>Hmm.. yes. The list just get's longer. Try using external drives on a USB 3.0 port. In many instances the drive disappears after 5 minutes. This issue has been known and documented for a while--but still no update. Working with Microsoft products for over
 15+ years now, it's really surprising how slow the response time is to these issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And don't forget the BSOD for MEMORY_MANAGEMENT many people are getting. I'm not talking memory sticks/CAS either. I'm talking application compatibility--where the compatibility&nbsp;setting won't solve it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh yes, and&nbsp;you've got all these issues and want to go into safe mode to&nbsp;trouble-shoot? Windows 8.1&nbsp;has a bunny trail to get to that too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gag, I'm having to revert some of my PCs back to Windows 7. It's just a more solid and reliable platform...&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I keep working with Windows 8.1 this list is going to keep getting bigger and bigger...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's starting to feel like Windows ME all over again.</p>

            <p>It is now Jun 2015 and I agree even now that Windows 10 is not ready for prime time. I have had repeated upgrading issues with the OS. Additionally the search/cortona function stops working after several updates from the base build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more importantly to me I think the new windows menu function needs greater improvement. Lets step back an look at why this is being changed. Most users of windows 7 like the old menu format.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18dbd95e-4776-4df7-93fa-6e50c4700a64" height="396" width="370" /></p>
<p>In this menu you have the ability to open all programs.</p>
<p>On the current version of Windows 10 Preview I have to scroll up and down to list all the programs.</p>
<p>In Windows 8 to list all programs we hit the arrow key and then get a nice expanded list of programs that can be sorted by last installed, alphabetic, most used etc.&nbsp; But again in windows 10 we seem to lose this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8 we get the Tile start menu that scrolls right to left and scrolls off border works well with touch and mouse.&nbsp; In windows 10 we get a grid area next to the all programs list and if it does not fit it scrolls up and down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how is this a better way?&nbsp; Why not give us the choice either a windows 7/XP menu void the tiles or a Windows 8 option.&nbsp; Surprisingly I have been in this industry since&nbsp;windows 3.1 and have learned to adopt to the interfaces each time.&nbsp; But I think the
 current version of the widows 10 interface is a horrible compromise to the start menu. What is Microsoft thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally while the upgrade from windows 8 to 10 went&nbsp;fairly smoothly (not really) I had to retry several times.&nbsp; And as I may have said earlier updates failed several times. I finally did a clean install and things went well until an upgrade killed my
 search functionality. After several reinstalls I got the capability back for a while but again after some updates it was gone.&nbsp; Eventually I even lost the ability to open the start menu. Finally the last&nbsp;step was the inability to upgrade to 10130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think the product is consumer ready for July and Microsoft really needs to review the failures its test base is having or it will have another "Vista" on its hands. So what if Windows 10 is free...If it fails and hurts the image of the Company (Microsoft)
 this could be very significant to further acceptance of other flagship products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft takes these comments seriously. I know that some of this may be superficial but first look and feel may really make or break this product and the need to get it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please not I would include more images from windows 10 screens but my test machine crashed and I am having issues reinstalling the base image.</p>

<h2>            win 10 error code 0xc00000e9</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My windows version is WIN 10 Pro. I recently noticed that the windows start up has become very slow. Consequently, I tried to run start up repair using the repair disc for Win 10 Pro - 32-bit I created earlier. I performed a reboot using the repair disc,
 then I received a message saying that the disc is corrupted, and the repair process could not be completed.&nbsp;I created a new repair disc and tried again to complete the process. This time I got a message saying the process failed because of error code 0xc00000e9.
 Any help with this issue? Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code 0xc00000e9 usually appears on the PC if there is any hardware malfunctions. To help you diagnose what is causing the issue, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Try to check if any of your device is causing the problem. Remove all&nbsp;the USB cables connected to your PC and reconnect them one by one until you verify which is causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings </strong>and click <strong>Update and recovery</strong>. From
<strong>Recovery</strong>, click <strong>Advance startup </strong>and click <strong>
Restart </strong>now. After the PC reboots, click <strong>Automatic repair </strong>
from <strong>Advanced startup</strong>. Once you are done, reboot your PC again. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If all fails, the issue might be related to&nbsp;the hard drive.&nbsp;Try to plug in another hard drive and check if the old hard drive is causing the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it went.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Store Downloads PAINFULLY slow</h2>
                    <p>I've installed Windows 8 Pro (release version) on an Oracle VirtualBox and everything runs fine EXCEPT downloading things from the Microsoft Store. When I first started up the store, it said I needed to update 15 applications (ones that came with Windows,
 I think) and I told it to go ahead.&nbsp; The next screen came up and it showed the 15 apps (things like photos, people, etc) with a progress bar next to each one. Under the progress bar it said "Pending".&nbsp; After about 5 minutes several of the status indicators
 went to "Could not ..." and several went to "Downloading".&nbsp; After SEVERAL HOURS (I'm connected on the corporate LAN that runs normally around 10Mb for downloads) SOME of the itmes finished and some went to an error state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's up?&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; Is the Microsoft Store being DOS'ed?&nbsp; IE 10 on Windows 8 is working fine with no speed issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

I would suggest trying a different controller if possible to see if it helps resolve your issue.

<h2>            windows 8.1 ethernet does not have a valid IP configuration</h2>
                    <p>I had an internet connection problem that I thought was an ISP problem. They tested the line and sent out a tech and diagnosed a problem and cleared it. At some point I had the message as above after running network diagnostics. If I clear IPCONFIG and reset
 it I can get internet access BUT after a power down/up again the problem remains and I have to clear IPCONFIG etc again ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>tks in advance</p>

<p>The command is given in the windows help screens under "why can't I connect to the internet?" It gives, bring up the command prompt and type
<strong>ipconfig/release </strong>and then press enter, This releases your current ip address.&nbsp; It then goes on to say at the command prompt, type<strong> ipconfig/renew
</strong>and then press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When carrying out this process I can get access to the internet BUT when I powerdown/up I have to repeat the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently looking at&nbsp; the actual ip address on my pc to compare with the laptop on the same router (TalkTalk&nbsp; D-Link DSL 2680)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another "help" question someone had a similar problem and it looks like it was the ISP so I am reluctant at this time to carry out any other pc action until I can see if it may be the provider?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your method 1 returned un unavailable message.</p>

<p>Current state. I noted that the latest update had failed. I tried several times but it failed. I looked up the failure notice ( there wasn't an exact one) ran the fix and then the update was successful. I have since worked on the pc 3 times and each time
 it logged to the internet at start up. Twice during a session ther was a disconnection. One was back within seconds with no intervention the second time was prolonged, the router had lost ips and dsl. I followed the "fix" option on the failure screen and it
 came back after running that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am holding my breath and try it over a few days before taking any other action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as the update not being down loaded ( it would fault out after a few mins while down loading) I have noticed that my Panda security is not filling in the "log" so I have no history of what it is doing.&nbsp; All other "parts" of the Panda appear to be
 ok. I am contacting Panda help wrt to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, case rests for now, but still open to suggestions on the part that I have described.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the long delay.</p>
<p>Further investigations indicated that the latest Microsoft update had not completed as well as the IP problem AND my antivirus (Panda) was not giving its events log, although all other parts appeared to be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I removed Panda and re installed at their request and all seems to be ok, all except that from time to time when I am on the internet I get a prompt that says "internet explorer has detected a problem and needs to close" I have never had that
 problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on that one?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Sorry for the long delay in replying but your suggested fix process took a long time in trial and assessment. I have had no IP errors since reloading the Panda. I had about
<span>&nbsp;</span>3 to 4 days of error free connection to the internet and then it has been a case of work for a few hours and then refuse to connect until completing a re start when it works again for a few hours and then drops out.I have tried I think all of
 the processes that the link was for but none have lasted as a fix. Typically it will fail when trying to connect to internet at some point in time or, when trying to move to a different page when already connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Most of the time there is a page stating the fault with a box to find the problem. This usually ends with network diagnostics saying that I should restart the router. Tried that a couple of times with no success but in any case if I try my laptop (wireless)
 it always connects but it is a slow machine anyway. Also my ‚Äúsmart‚Äù tv always connects quickly (via a mains /router connection device, works well). So, probably not the router. Trying Ethernet status says that there is no problem . A couple of times I have
 had ‚Äúa problem is presenting the trouble shooter from starting and this may give 0x80070426/0057.</p>
<p>I have tried the ping function when it is not working and it returns a non connection. I have also tried ‚Äúfixes‚Äù suggested in windows 8 inside out book with no luck except that probably dns is ok.</p>
<p>Any help welcomed</p>

</p><p>Tried that one but it is about the same except I think I get more "internet explorer needs to close etc etc..</p>
<p>AND most power up I need to restart before it connects to the internet. Sorry. I assume that to revert back to where I was will be ...bcdedit/debug on...</p>
<p>Please confirm.</p>
<p>I think maybe the next process is to carry out the windows 8.1 repair process when I have all the other program details collected together?</p>

    <title>stuck after adding SSD to my new Lenovo desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> organdan  say:</h3>
<h2>            stuck after adding SSD to my new Lenovo desktop</h2>
                    <p>I planned to migrate Windows 10 from my new Lenovo desktop's C: drive with a 1T HDD to a newly-installed SSD. &nbsp;Cloning the OS (and a few other C: files) to the new SSD with EaseUS Todo seemed to go successfully, but I don't know how to complete the process
 - here's why....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lenovo boots successfully when ONLY the HDD drive is disconnected, and the C: drive is the SSD. &nbsp;All installed programs run normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I restart with both drives connected, I have a Windows A: drive (SSD) and Windows C: drive, and don't know which I'm booting from. I can't use Disk Manager (or EaseUS Todo) to wipe / reformat the HDD, because it has a boot partition, and neither
 software will let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care what letter drive the SSD is, as long as I can boot from it, and use the HDD however I want, but I can't get there. What do I do now? &nbsp;This can't be a very hard problem to solve, but I am very eager to hear suggestions on how to proceed. &nbsp;Thanks</p>
<p>

    <title>Update to Windows Live Mail disables abitity to drag email from inbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update to Windows Live Mail disables abitity to drag email from inbox to storage.</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Home and Professional and Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;Suddenly, I am unable to drag and email from inbox to storage file. &nbsp;I must click on move and then click on folder. &nbsp;Previously, I could drag a group of emails with the same subject or
 an individual email from my inbox list to one of my storage folders which was a much quicker way. &nbsp;The only change in my software was a Word update that I was prompted to do. &nbsp;I have not upgraded to Windows &nbsp;10.

<h2>            Netflix achievement stuck</h2>
                    <p>The&nbsp;Netflix achievement(the ultimate opinion)&nbsp;is stuck at 55%. I tried uninstalling the app and installing it again. I did a power cycle. I was using a Blu-ray player and rated a few things on Netflix, and I think the Achievement got stuck because of it. I went back on my Xbox One and it is stuck. I rated like&nbsp;20 things on the Xbox One&nbsp;and the achievement still says at 55%. I waited 72 hours and the achievement still says it is at 55%. Is there any way to fix this? This is my last achievement to get for Netflix, and I want to get it a lot.</p>

            <p>i have the same issue on a 360 game i bought as download code. it keeps asking for a disc. why would it ask me for a disc when its a download code and i already downloaded it?</p><p>then it says i should connect to xbox live when i am connected to xbox live.</p><p>i am starting to think microsoft is worse than sony with all the crazy amounts of people having this issue. how can this still be going on and microsoft not being able to reach (livechat always down) and not telling you in the xbox what the actual issue is? it just says error code 0x800705b4 and sometimes 0x803f8001 but this does not help at all, tried everything including re-downloading several times, changing every single xbox setting, visiting the store again and again and even in different regions but nothing helps.&nbsp;  </p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm unable to run sfc /scannow to completion it stops at 82%.</p>
<p>I've run sfc /verifyonly which completes (after hanging for a few minutes at 82%).</p>
<p>I then get the following error message in the command prompt. "Windows Resource Protection found integrity violations. Details are included in the CBS. Log.</p>
<p>I've accessed the log which is 10,891kb in size, BUT do not know what to look for.</p>
<p>Can someone assist? PS I am unable to complete a chkdsk which is what prompted the scannow in the first place.</p>

    <title>Unable to delete windowsapps folders created after changing location - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to delete windowsapps folders created after changing location of microsoft app installation.</h2>
                    <p>Before the 1511 update I wasn't able to set the default app location anywhere apart from my small ssd C: drive. After the update I was able to change the installation location. I managed to delete the C: windowsapps folder using by giving my self system
 access in a file manager, admin level powershell commands and other third party programs. However I was unable to do the same in my other drives using the same method after I decided to change the location again and I now had redundant windowsapps folders
 I couldn't delete because I didn't have permission . So I tried setting all the default locations to my F: drive to see if having a default location of music, pictures ect in the same drive allow me to delete the windowsapp folder and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to delete windowsapp folders that my computer isn't using and if that is not possible find a way to hide them (which I have already tried.)</p>

            <p>I've run into the same issue as the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run into a couple of different prompts and messages. When I right-click the folder and choose the delete option in the drop-down menu, I get this prompt.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0546eaa5-0da5-4217-9ed2-412e0fe29dc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0546eaa5-0da5-4217-9ed2-412e0fe29dc1" /></a></p>
<p>I click 'Yes' and then get to this dialog box:</p>

<p>I click 'Continue' (I was already logged into the Windows 10 system with an account that has all Admin privileges - there is literally only one account on this computer and I am using it). I then (briefly) see the file operation progress dialog box which
 then unceremoniously dumps me into this final dialog box:</p>

            <p>I've been having the same problem and have tried to follow your instructions. However, under the security tab i see this:
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fc896d16-c4d5-45f0-bba5-c1e97aaafaf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfc896d16-c4d5-45f0-bba5-c1e97aaafaf7" /></a></p>
<p>So i click on Advanced and it brings me here:</p>

<p>Even though I am set to the Owner of the folder, I can't change the permission entries (note the grey add/remove buttons) and clicking view shows this:</p>

<p>Everything greyed out under basic permissions and advanced permissions:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=30112601-0314-4b9d-b6cf-a2f4d0654a40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d30112601-0314-4b9d-b6cf-a2f4d0654a40" /></a></p>

            <p>The windows apps folder has some insane security on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out via a personal experience and some googling after that experience on a computer with a working OS that the windowsapps folder is used by windows 10 to create new users. Without it some windows 10 apps don't install properly and the UI and other
 processes become buggy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit* I somehow deleted one version of the windowapps folder which caused chaos. (Shenanigans occurred with changing default file locations and moving directorys and file locations)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I messed up quite badly trying to fix my problem and ended with a desktop in legacy/fastboot mode with completely blank hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get my desktop up and running again without the help of someone who actually knows what there are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that the sets similar sets of problems and situations that the people on this forum have experienced are not very common so there isn't much trouble shooting advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice as someone who bumbled through fixing it is that if the windowapp folder is causing you trouble and is becoming to much of a hindrance and you can't figure it out or no one can help you then just bite the bullet and find work arounds to sync as
 much settings and other stuff as you can, back up the rest and the fully reset your pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my windows tablet last week and windows created a file with all the names of all the apps it removed during the reset (I choose to keep my documents) so that might be handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>So I managed to delete the windowsapps folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a version of linux, burned it to a disc and set the DVD drive as the boot device. Linux booted off the disc without installing anything, so none of my files were touched. I just went into the location where windowsapps was and deleted it with
 no fuss. Windows cant stop you from deleting a system folder if you're not using Windows! I'll admit, there was plenty of cursing at the windows OS for trying to "protect" me from doing something it perceived as reckless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick tip for this method: turn off fast boot, or else linux wont be able to access the hard drive due to the hibernation files on the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for being unable to grant myself permissions to delete the folder in windows, that remains a mystery. Having the user be the principal for the folder does absolutely nothing and there's no reason for it not to i this case. Could be a security thing, I
 don't know, but it's very frustrating.</p>

            <p>I should probably mention then that I deleted the original windows apps folder in my C: Drive (Drive with OS installed) by using some third party programs to give me some kind of permission or system access. Sorry it was back in November so I can't exactly
 remember what I did but I could find out if you want. The one I couldn't do anything with was the copy on my D: drive after changing the install location a few times. Edit* I had a copy of the windowsapp folder on my external but I formatted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went the Linux route via Ubuntu but I had a blank computer so I didn't have grub1 or grub2 installed and I didn't have any bootable storage devices. I think I made my external hard drive bootable and did some iso stuff with Ubuntu using the partition
 manager on my tablet. There where a few more dead ends after that but there are not really relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to avoid putting on the tin foil hat but I don't think that the windowsapp folder is that secure to protect us. There are a lot easier ways to unintentionally mess up a PC and you need at least some level of computer&nbsp;literacy to find it and then
 a bit more to know what it is and do things with it. The security might have something to do with privacy. However windows 10 kinda outright states what its doing and people would of probably said if they found anything too sinister in the folder and store
 apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that as the windows apps are probably are a mix of clientside and severside that microsoft made the windowsapp folder that secure on the main drive and even more so other drives is to try to prevent things like windows store, xbox and other
 places where you buy things from being exploited.</p>

ME TOO! UGH! I only got the WindowsApps folder because I went and bought a 5TB secondary internal HDD. And went to move the folders over to that drive and now im stuck with this "WIndowsApps" folder, that says it's EMPTY! SO WHY CAN I NOT DELETE IT?! SMH. I
 guess there's still no fix!? Smh. It's one thing after another with this dang Windows 10.. We're damned if we do and damned if we don't! It's really starting to get quite frustrating. I'm honestly about to just go back to windows 8.1 at LEAST that was stable.
 I only upgraded because I read online that the windows insiders will be the first few to get the OFFICIAL last build version of windows 10. So I really liked windows 10 when I first upgraded to it, but there was just wayy&nbsp;too many problems. So I went back
 to 8.1 and then that's when I read about the insiders getting the first OFFICIAL version of 10. So I went back to 10, and found a lot of fixes for most of the problems I previously had on the last time I upgraded then had to roll back. This is going to &nbsp;be
 very hard to decide what I want to do. I really like the way windows 10 looks and the layout, but there is just way too many unstable features. Ugh, decisions, decisions.&nbsp;

<h2>            File system error &#40;-1073741819&#41; continually pops up&#63;</h2>
                    I have already read the previously answered questions on this topic, and I find that I am supposed to try the file system checker, or try a clean boot. But when I attempt to do either one of these things, I get the exact same message (file system error
 -1073741819).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My other problem is that i appear to no longer have access to task manager, windows installer, and can not install any program on my computer. I can make the downloads just fine, only can not install them. My mother-in-law bought me this computer as a
 gift, and she didn't know that she needed to also have the discs that came with it. I am so lost, and I need my computer to work. If it's not back up by monday, there is a good chance I could lose my job. I dont know if this question even makes sense to anyone,
 but if so, any help would be appreciated.</div>
