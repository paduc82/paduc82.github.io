    <title>Moving Files and changing names in FileHistory folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinlw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Files and changing names in FileHistory folder</h2>
                    <p>We have a File History backup on an external hard drive. We have since deleted the files on our computer that it was backing up through File History, so our only copy of these files are in the FileHistory folder on the external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an fit of overzealous reorganizing, we started going through those files and folders in the external hard drive FileHistory folder and renaming things and moving them around. I then had the thought that this might be a bad thing. Even though the files
 all appear to be fine and dandy, I have since read online that doing this could potentially corrupt the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: What should we do now? The files all seem fine. Can we assume they are all good, and we don't need to worry? Or do we need to do a reinstating of the files through the proper File History restoration process and then back them up manually
 to the external hard drive to ensure that the files will not be corrupted in the future (if they haven't already)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>You must immediately re-apply the principle that requires all important files to be stored on two different media. While doing this you will find out if the files are intact.</p>

            <p>It looks like all the files are intact, in that we can open them and they are fine. Is there a possibility that they will get corrupted in the future? Or is it safe to say that, as they are now, disconnected from any further File History backups, the files
 are fine?</p>

<p>Why do you feel that files stored on a backup disk should get corrupted? "Corruption" implies that something opens, then modifies the files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This was the closest question to our issue I could find on the support forums. According to the top answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"File History can't be browsed using the file system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You should never try to browse these files using the normal file browser.&nbsp; Use the File History interface only or you will corrupt your backups.&nbsp; Even just clicking the "administrator
 continue" option to access the files can change the ownership and break your backups."</span></p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>But we have been given conflicting information from other sources who have said that as long as the files open, they should be fine. Our files seem to be working as expected. Is it safe to assume they are a-ok moving forward?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            The article you quote refers to Windows 8. I have dealt extensively with the Windows 10 version of File History and have never experienced any "corruption", even while accessing the File History folder with File Explorer.

<h2>            I changed my user account name and now my computer is messed up</h2>
                    <p>Reason to change name: I didn't like how my name was incomplete for my account name on my PC, it was "carte" instead of "Carter", so I searched on the internet to figure how to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did: Win + r, searched "netplwiz", opened up a window called User Accounts, I select on the account that is mine (also the admin), I click on properties, it opens up a new window allowing me to change my username, I change my username and click apply.
 And now not only is what I wanted to be changed, not changed, but my entire computer is screwed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong that I can tell: I can't find my account on the users list (place where I changed it), I can't use the cortana search, I can't go into settings, and clicking or pressing the window icon on my screen/keyboard does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, i'm too afraid to even restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit:: When accessing some files I will get an error message, "No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.</p>

<p>Only annoying part with WC is the end sequence, especially with Black Eye. Just have to make sure to give yourself enough time to pistol/shotgun through the grunts that rush out, plus pick up the drop shield and shotgun/melee the Elites to finish.

<p>Reydaitso, I think they closed that gate glitch. WC speed run is the easiest. Just sprint all the way through it. Most of the mission time will be used up waiting to progress further. Simple Weekly Challenge.</p>

<p>Yeah, WC was by far the easiest. &nbsp;You'll lost a minute or two while Kat is trying to close that door...but in total, this will take you no longer than 8-10 minutes. &nbsp;Be sure to pick up an Energy Pistol to lower the shields of the two Elites at the end of
 the mission. &nbsp;Relatively easy pickings.</p>

<br />It is possible a Windows 10 update has corrupted your COREL DRAW 2018 installation, have you tried uninstalling Corel and then re-installing the latest version available form the Corel website?

<h2>            Mass Effect Trilogy on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I was really excited to download the Mass Effect Trilogy to my Xbox One since they're all available. The original posting under backwards compatibility says that all DLC is compatible, but for Mass Effect 2, the only DLC that seems available is Arrival. I can't seem to find downloads for Lair of the Shadow Broker, Overlord, etc. I bought it for the 360 from the Xbox Store, so where can I get this content? Is it just not available for the One? Thanks for the help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Atheros AR9485 Wireless Adapter and Windows 8 &#40;NOT 8.1&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jarrettknauer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Atheros AR9485 Wireless Adapter and Windows 8 &#40;NOT 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Just today (June 16 2014) I purchased an Asus X750LA laptop to replace my older Asus for school. The imminent problem is that wireless network capability --put plainly -- is a joke. After reading around, clearly it seems that the AR9485 network adapter has
 its problems, although mine are strictly restricted to Windows 8, and not Windows 8.1. All other devices in my house have no issue on the wireless network, and maintain five bars on the network status icon; my new X750LA has difficulty maintaining three. Visual
 indicators aside, streaming video and downloading larger files is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The X750LA comes pre-installed with the V10.0.211 driver for the network adapter, and as suggested by others I uninstalled the driver and installed a newer driver found on the Asus Support website -- and if anything the connectivity degraded even further,
 as I was then randomly booted off the network. Looking around the web, I found the "latest" drivers for the AR9485. Although there were minor improvements, the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What frustrates me the most is that Qualcomm Atheros' official site and resource section has no official distribution or support page for its own driver. It drives me nuts (excuse the pun) that the manufacturer of a clearly defective adapter offers no direct
 assistance. I am still waiting on Asus Support to respond to my ticket, but I want to know definitively if anyone has actually managed to solve this problem. All the threads I find are either outdated or end unresolved. I have two weeks to decide whether or
 not to return the machine, and thus far I am inclined to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Media Remote TV code</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Xbox 360 media remote the newest one, it is brand new and I would like to connect it to my TV a Sense 32" TV bought off eBuyer over a year ago, I didn't expect there to be but I checked for the TV code anyway and it wasn't there. The model number
 is SE-32UT, &nbsp;after quite a while searching google for answers and using the suggestions I was unable to get it working which is disappointing.</p>
<p>Does anybody know a code that works?<br />
or is there any other way I have tried the searching but it didn't do anything don't know if I got through all the codes but I was doing it for a while.</p>
<p>Also a few of the codes i have tried from the PDF file provided on the support page don't register as far as i can see as the light doesnt flash 3 times is there a reason for this?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,<br />

<p>You can send a sequence of codes to from your remote to your TV to find the right code for your TV, if you do not know it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn on your TV and point the media remote toward it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press and hold the Mute and 5 buttons simultaneously for two seconds to enter TV programming mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Channel Up button repeatedly to send one code per button press from your media remote to your TV. By pressing Channel Up, you advance the code each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When the correct code is sent from the media remote to your TV, your TV will turn off. Press the Select button to confirm your code.</p>
<p>If your TV turns off but you then accidently continue to press Channel Up to continue past the correct code, press Channel Down to go back to the correct code. Your TV will turn on again when you go back to the correct code. Press the Select button to confirm
 your code.</p>

            <p>Hi Oscar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: Are you referring to the Microsoft Office Outlook or Outlook.com Website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you try turning off<strong> Message Preview </strong>from the<strong> View
</strong>tab, if you are using Office Outlook. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to Outlook.com website, then&nbsp;follow the steps.</p>
<p>1. Press the <strong>Tools </strong>icon and select <strong>Options.</strong></p>
<p>2. Under<strong> Reading email</strong>, select <strong>Active View Settings</strong> and click on
<strong>Hide Previews.</strong></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Save</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if this helps. </p>
<p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">To clarify my problem. The mail app on Windows 10 quit working. Using Windows Edge, I can check my Outlook mail. I would like to get the Windows 10 mail app to work as I also have two other Mail accounts there. I did a restore to
 Oct. 5, 15 and it shows the emails on Outlook up to Oct 5th but nothing on&nbsp;the other accounts. It doesn't update anything and gives me the same message or they haven't synced. I will do my best to answer any questions that you have. Any suggestions would be
 appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            As you can see, I have received no further information or suggestions. I hope there is a way to resolve this soon. I updated from 8.1 on my Lenovo Flex 2-15 laptop. In control panel it indicates my old system is 7. If all else fails, could I revert to
 my 8.1 system and update to 10 again? <br />

            I did a complete download and reinstall of Windows 10 and for the moment that seems to have solved my problem. All three of my emails are downloading again. For some reason, AT&amp;T is the only one that allows control of the sync options.

<p>Go to settings -&gt; privacy - email/calendar -&gt; set all options to on.</p>

    <title>Surface Book won&#39;t charge &#47; detach - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acayla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book won&#39;t charge &#47; detach</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone here can help me out considering it's Sunday and unfortunately, the Microsoft Answer Desk is closed until tomorrow. Since I'm not sure where the problem lies, I'm also not sure whether I'm in the right category, so bear with me please...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to watch a movie last night, so I detached and reattached the screen the otherway around. Everything seemed to be fine then. In the middle of the movie I got very tired; I knew I was going to fall asleep, so I pressed the Surface Power button once
 to shut off the screen and made sure to plug in the power cord, so it wouldn't run out of battery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I woke up around 2-3 hours later, I tried to wake it in order to switch the screen back into the right position and shut it down properly (I knew by that point that I wasn't going to continue watching). However, it didn't turn back on like it usually
 does. Instead, it flashed the empty battery screen and turned back off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, I was very surprised at this, since the power cord (original from Microsoft) was still plugged in and glowing steadily. I did notice though, that the screen detachment button on the keybord was glowing red indicating that something must have gone
 wrong with the connection between screen and keybord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled a few solutions with my phone and somehow managed to get the screen charging again. I was able to turn the surface book on and take a look at the battery in the lower left screen. It said that battery 1 was not available and battery 2 was charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to find out what was wrong, but somewhere in the process, battery 2 stopped receiving a charge and is now dead again.... Additionally the screen isn't turning on anymore at all (the detachment button is still glowing red though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there even anything left I can do at this point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has someone experienced something similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very worried that I'll lose all my data - I've been using the surface book for work and university for the past three months...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the i7 8gb ram version, if that matters...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any and all helpful replies!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Managed to get battery 2 charging again. Battery 1 is still not being detected, and I can't detach the keyboard (hopefully, because it's not charged), but the button isn't glowing red anymore. I installed all updates available, and I'm currently
 waiting for it to charge to 100% before I try anything else. Suggestions on what to do next would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Apologies for the late reply. I've always been extremely careful with my Surface Book as it is the most expensive thing I own aside from my car.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image an L. The I is the screen; the _ the keyboard. "i" would be myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I placed the Surface Book infront of me like so: "i" I_</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then leaned down and frocefully pressed on the upper part of the I (the screen). I was however careful, that the screen wasn't moving (opening or closing) and that the force was directed downward and not sideways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I was trying to press the screen even further into the keyboard in order for the Surface Book to register that it's attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answered your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, this topic can be marked as "answered". I can't really select an answer though, since I provided the solution myself... Maybe a mod could close the question, please?</p>

<p>I agree on the Halo HD remake as being quite good but apart from that it's a very lackluster affair. Nothing listed makes me think MS are turning this year back around to their advantage. Poor effort this year</p>

            Hello  Keslene, hope this message finds you well. My name is Steve and I'm an Independent advisor.
<br />
<br />You don’t have to get these files in Directx 12.0 because Windows 10 comes with DirectX 12.0 by default. You can update it using Windows Update. There is not any option to downgrade Direct X. Of course some old games can require DirectX 9.0 to run and will not run using DirectX 12.0. 
<br />You should try to install the games in compatibility mode:
<br />1.Right-click on the game setup file
<br />2.Press Properties
<br />3.Click on the Compatibility tab and mark the checkbox Run this program in compatibility mode for, then click on Windows 7/8/8.1 operating system
<br />4.Then press Apply and OK and start the file to install it
<br />If it doesn’t help, I recommend that you get in touch with Steam support, because they are able to help you find a fix.
<br />
<br />____
<br />Steven

<h2>            My computer has a blue screen and after a restart, won&#39;t go into safe mode.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Dell Dimension 3000 Desktop computer, 80 GB hard drive, 4 GB RAM, Windows XP Home edition, SP2 (I think).</p>
<p>Here is my problem:</p>
<p>My computer was getting critically low on hard drive space, so I decided I would delete some of the programs the next time I logged into the computer. I turned it off last night, but when I went to turn it back on today to delete some of the programs, it
 came up with a <strong>black screen</strong> .</p>
<p>It said: "We apologize for this inconvenience but Windows has been shut down to avoid damage to the computer. This may have been caused by software or hardware difficulties.........Would you like to start in</p>
<p><strong>Safe Mode</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe Mode with networking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe Mode with Command prompts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Start Windows Normally"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After choosing any of the ways to start the computer, a <strong>blue screen</strong> comes up saying:</p>
<p>"A problem has been detected and Windows needs to close to prevent damage to your computer</p>
<p>UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this error, restart your computer. If this screen appears again follow these steps:</p>
<p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed............."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried doing what it says to do but I can't get onto the computer to uninstall any software....I think it might have been cause by:</p>
<p><strong>The critically low hard drive space.</strong></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>The power outage this morning.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea of how to solve the problem while still keeping the files on the computer?</p>
<p>I don't want to wipe it clean until I can get all the important files onto a flash drive....</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You only need to post once.&nbsp; In fact, if you post the same thing multiple times, that might decrease the chance that someone will respond.</p>
<p>There probably is a "Stop Code" associated with the Unmountable_Boot_Volume error message.&nbsp; If the message you get is STOP 0x000000ED (0x&lt;var&gt;aaaaaaaa&lt;/var&gt; ,0x&lt;var&gt;bbbbbbbb&lt;/var&gt; ,0x&lt;var&gt;cccccccc&lt;/var&gt; ,0x&lt;var&gt;dddddddd&lt;/var&gt; ), it is described<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/297185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 .&nbsp; Essentially, there are two possibilities.&nbsp; If the second parameter (0x&lt;var&gt;bbbbbbbb&lt;/var&gt; ) of the<strong>Stop</strong> error is
<strong>0xC0000032</strong> , the cause of the error is that the file system is damaged. Otherwise, it's supposedly a problem with the cable connecting your hard drive to your motherboard.</p>
<p>If the computer was on during the power outage, there's a reasonable possibility that the file system is damaged.&nbsp; If you have access to any Windows XP CD (not necessarily the one that came with this computer), you can boot to the Windows Recovery Console
 and use chkdsk /r as described in the article linked above.</p>
<p>I've also seen suggestions that executing the "fixboot" command from the Windows Recovery Console has helped on occasion.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of the Windows XP Recovery Console for advanced users</a></p>
<p>If you don't have a Windows XP CD, you can still get the Recovery Console.&nbsp; Microsoft provides a set of 6 floppy disks that include the Recovery Console -- but these days odds are that you don't have a floppy disk drive.&nbsp; There are various sites on the Internet
 that have iso files for a bootable CD including the recovery console.&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.pcpitstop.com/index.php?showtopic=150212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This is one</a> (I haven't used it).</p>
<p>Finally, you are correct to be concerned about your data.&nbsp; Even the MS KB article first linked above warns that running CHKDSK /R "may" result in data loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be most conservative, remove your hard drive from the Dell, put it in an external enclosure
 (these can be quite inexpensive; just make sure that you get one with the correct interface for your drive -- SATA or parallel ATA), connect it to a working computer and copy off the files you really don't want to lose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I won't delete everything I just wrote, but I realized as I wrote the last paragraph that if you put the drive in an external enclosure you can run the disk manufacturer's diagnostic utility and/or chkdsk /f from the working computer rather than
 go through all of the nonsense to get to the Recovery Console.</p>

            I have a evrex nb with windows xp. I used the recovery dvd-rom but keep getting the same blue screen with the message unmountable boot volume as descirbed in the question u provided an answer to. If any is there another process i should try to get past
 this error message? This computer is one that we can do without but hate to just throw it away if it could be used for games or simple task. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
        </p>
