<h2>            infotip&#47;tooltip &#38; the &#39;My Computer&#39; icon</h2>
                    
<p>How do I edit the registry so that the infotip/tooltip for the 'My Computer' icon shows the actual name of the computer?&nbsp; I know I can hard code this, but I would rather the info get pulled from somewhere else in the registry - I've got 900 PCs...<br />
<br />
thanks - Terry</p>

            Hi Luigi, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />I suggest you refer to the following article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17438/windows-internet-explorer-view-delete-browsing-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17438/...</a>  
<br />After deleting the browsing history, follow the steps below, they will help you to remove the drop down list from the address bar:
<br />Press Windows key + R buttons together to open Run. (Go to Start and search for Run)
<br />In the dialog box, type in inetcpl.cpl and click on Enter.
<br />Find the Internet properties window and click on Content tab
<br />Click on Settings under AutoComplete options
<br />Uncheck the box Address bar under the AutoComplete Settings and click on ok.
<br />Click on Apply and ok.
<br />Restart Internet Explorer.

            Hi Luigi, 
<br />
<br />If you click on tools with IE, then internet options, look for browsing history, then the delete button. Make sure “history” is checked off, and then click delete. 
<br />
<br />Close that window, and click “settings” right next to the delete button. Click the History tab, and change the day to keep those sites at 1 day. 
<br />
<br />This should help solve this problem moving forward. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

    <title>Pre-ordered Dishonored 2 Limited Edition...but haven&#39;t received - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> navmeist3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pre-ordered Dishonored 2 Limited Edition...but haven&#39;t received Dishonored Definitive code...</h2>
                    <p>I pre-ordered the Dishonored 2 Limited Edition (the only available copy) through my console on the MS Store and was hoping to see the Dishonored Definitive Edition added to my download queue or even to the 'My Games'&nbsp;section to download at a later date. However I have not received any kind of code or copy to download, and the game is still up for £14.99 on the MS Store when I'm logged into my profile. This is not just an issue for me either, as i've seen that quite a few other players arent getting their copies. Will we receive a code in the coming days/weeks to get our copies, or should we be able to add it from the store to our download queue?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

If you don't see it there, visit the game bundle for the Limited Edition and attempt to "buy" the Definitive edition. It should show up as free and you should be able to install it.

            <p>Hello Mister Maka,&nbsp;thank you for your reply. I've checked the store and my Ready to Install list and the Dishonored Definitive Edition still isn't available for me to download for free&nbsp;as part of the Limited Edition package I bought. The Limited Edition page on the MS store on my console is no longer available now for viewing,&nbsp;and so I cannot attempt to download it as part of the&nbsp;bundle anymore. I take it I'll need to get in contact with Microsoft to sort out this issue?</p>

Are you able to try removing your profile from your Xbox One and add it back to see if it correctly updates your license for the game?

<h3> aleksandrkwiatkowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 acting strange, can&#39;t reset with installation media</h2>
                    <p>I recently started having crippling issues with windows 10, and couldn't pinpoint what was happening. Generally, the computer runs much slower, caps out on all resources except ram at much lower loads, and refuses to cooperate even when doing simple tasks
 like switching focus from one window to another. However, sometimes it runs fine, and I can even run high quality games. Other times, the games will run fine, but will lock up for a few seconds at seemingly completely random points. I tried many things to
 get my computer to start working correctly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I scanned for malware, viruses, PUPs, etc. with both windows defender and malwarebytes</p>
<p>-I defragmented my drive</p>
<p>-I uninstalled un-needed programs and cleared up lots of old and temporary data</p>
<p>-I ran numerous 3rd party hardware checks to ensure the my hardware wasn't failing</p>
<p>-I tried resseting my bios settings to optimum default, and checked that nothing was overclocked</p>
<p>-I tried reverting to older windows updates, in-case a recent update was conflicting with something</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my next step was to simply back-up my absolutely needed data (which I completed with minimal hassle, surprisingly), and reset windows with my installation media. However, upon booting from said media and running the reset option to only reset windows
 and its settings without touching my personal data and programs, it said that the drive windows was stored on was locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Basically, all I'm wondering is if it is possible to unlock the drive, (yes I can still boot and run windows, just not well, if that is required) so that I can properly reset my windows? I would really prefer to not completely reformat everything,
 as I live in a rural area with slow internet, and it could take upwards of 2-3 continuous weeks of downloading to get my games and programs back.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not looking for help with repairing my computer- I have a few more steps to take, and I am simply stuck on this one. I don't want to skip any possibilities before I decide if reformatting and re-downloading is worth my time, or if I should buy a new
 hdd for primary use, and pull most of my data off my current hdd.</p>

            What is the make and model of the computer?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1709...
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

    <title>Skype 8 for Windows do not support windows - just one window&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin vildvinge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 8 for Windows do not support windows - just one window&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype since the beginning, when MSN messenger and ICQ were the top dogs.</p>
<p>Windows is all about multi-tasking. That is why it is called Windows and not Window. The latest update (not in any way an upgrade!) has removed the option of using more than one window. This is insane! I now have to write a message to a person, click BACK
 (a button that never should be needed in an application other than a browser), select another person and write to him/her. I then have to click BACK again, select the first person and write a reply.</p>
<p>What are you thinking? Why would you do this to a good application? PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT MAC PRODUCTS AND SLACK! Skype was a pioneer and a great tool, now it is becoming more and more useless.</p>
<p>Why should I use Skype and not Slack these days? You are killing your own software! Keep to what you are (used to be) - which is a great application for multitasking and multiple conversations. This was a great advantage over Slack.
</p>
<p>Microsoft and Skype team - Don't copy - lead!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: is it possible to downgrade to Multitask Skype?</p>

            Old Skype v 7 will stop working on 1-Sep-18, so I won't recommend you going back to v7. Yes, there is a lot of demand for either moving to old Skype or upgrade new Skype to match old Skype. Skype is expected to roll out new features at a faster rate and sooner or later, it would become better than new Skype 
<br />
<br />This is a temporary pain period for all Skype users. This is for better future.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers by following below help -

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

            The response here is quite frankly ridiculous. Why should users be forced to deal with limited functionality and options when there is a perfectly good older version? Keep building the new version, but dont force it onto anyone until it has all the functionality.
 How is that hard?<br />

            I agree. The old version has stopped working on my PC and I cannot download anything other than the newest version on skype.com. They do this at a time when there are so many competitors, FB messenger, Slack and all others?
<br />
Skype had many advantages over those, such as multitasking and the ability to call any phone, and I am sad to see Skype taking this direction, making their loyal users upset. Loyal users who already struggle to convince people to keep/re-join Skype. I think
 Skype is dying and perhaps this is what Microsoft wants. I understand upgrading the software is necessary, as I am a developer myself, but I cannot see how the new version is in any way an improvement for the users. The architecture might have changed but
 is it really that hard to make separate windows? Seriously?

<h2>            External hard drive problem</h2>
                    I have 2TB seaget hard disk (HD) . As soon as I attach my hard disk to surface go it shows 100% performance in task manager with 0 reading and writing speed. No antivirus is working as I start scanning it, it stays at 0% for long time until it detaches
 itself. Even the command prompt is not working on it as it stays in responsive. I tried to format it but there is no showing of format dialogue box until I detaches my HD. I can not go to safe mode as it requires password and Internet connection (wired) which
 I don't have.&nbsp;

            Hi Sandeep,
<br />
<br />From your explanation it does sound like the 2tb hdd maybe failing. How old is it? I would recommend installing Seagate tools program to test the hdd health.  Does the same issue occur when plugging it in a different computer? 
<br />
<br />Let us know how you go?
<br />
<br />Thanks

            Try formatting the drive using the command prompt.&nbsp; You can look up how to do that.&nbsp; Make sure you have a backup of the files on the disk before you reformat the drive otherwise you can try to repair it.&nbsp; I had to reformat my external drive and it has
 worked fine ever since.<br />

            I bought it 2 weeks ago. I tried running SMART scan and short drive self test. In short drive self test it shows ok. But in SMART scan it shows drive status - SMART, without giving any result. And no response in short generic test it is stagnant with no

<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - is this an externally powered HDD? If not, the Surface could be struggling to power the device</p>
<p>2 - have you checked if the HDD is compatible with the Surface Go? If you are looking for extra storage, I would suggest a Micro SD card or solid state drive.</p>

<br />Can you try it in another computer to see if you get the same results. Just so we can narrow the issue down further. Especially since the HDD is new, it could be FOA.

    <title>Stroke in photoshop and online editing programs not working only on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleyt97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stroke in photoshop and online editing programs not working only on circles &#47; looks jagged &#38; pixelated.</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">Hello, I've posted this in other photoshop forums but during the time of little to no responses or answers on both the web and from adobe and microsoft,
 I've discovered a bit more information. So, before anything: I have tried resetting my photoshop brushes. Holding down ctrl alt shift to reset my photoshop and I have uninstalled and reinstalled this about 4 times now sadly in the attempt to find a solution.
 Unfortunately, I could also not use the Photoshop CS4 script clean tool as it asks me to download something else microsoft doesn't even make anymore just to run it. Nothing has fixed it. I am at 100% zoom, etc.&nbsp; I tried resizing but size shouldn't be an issue
 as it never was before and I should be able to use a 400x400px transparent canvas and it should look fine as it literally did before and how it does for text and squares when I add a stroke to it now. It's just a random issue with circles right now. I even
 tried the free trial of the Photoshop CC 2018 and the issue was on there as well (I did this while my CS4 Extended was uninstalled). I've made sure everything is compatible on my computer with adobe on the phone and it all is. I didn't have any issues with
 the stroke till I noticed it happening on March 31st and ever since then this issue has remained and I've literally asked EVERYONE. But recently I've noticed that the stroke works fine on text and squares. It's only if I use my brush tool just stamping a simple
 circle and adding a stroke, if I use my ellipse tool and add a stroke or layer stroke and also the elliptical marquee tool. None of the circle tools seem to work. I even have issues with the top bottom and two sides of a circle looking pinched when I use edit
 &gt; stroke as well. All strokes don't work on circles it seems. I literally can't figure out what I've done and can't find a solution. I'll provide some images all on a 400x400 px canvas it doesn't matter if I make it 3000x2500px it still is the same issue with
 only the stroke on circles.</span></p>

<p>https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2486284<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">I noticed this issue started happening on March 31st 2018&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">I'm not sure if an update or something could have caused this but when I send a psd file for photoshop to others the issue isn't there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">I'm just wondering if this might be happening to anyone else because it even happens when I open it on free online editors and add a stroke it's still
 pixelated or sawthoothed looking. So it has to be something that changed on my computer as it wasn't happening before when I first noticed at the end of March.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Low Disk Space Error on Drive E&#58; Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watson_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low Disk Space Error on Drive E&#58; Data</h2>
                    <p>Windows has been continuously warning me that I have low disk space on Drive E (named "Data"). I am unsure exactly what the drive is. It is not my recovery drive because I have an external recovery drive. I think it may be a partition created by my SSD from
 my last install, but since upgrading from 8 to 8.1 (earlier this week), I have been having this issue. I didn't have it on Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the disk is 99.9 Mb in size and has 576 Kb free. I cannot run disk cleanup because there are no files on the disk. When I open up the drive in file explorer, there are no files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Samsung 840 EVO 250Gb I am running, with Magician over-provisioning 7% to increase SSD performance. I have 5 drives connected to the computer: C: primary drive, D: system reserved drive, E: Data Drive (the one I am having problems with), F: my secondary
 hard drive, and G: my DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unsure whether to put this in "Files and Folders" or "Devices and Drivers" since a drive is technically a device, but the issue I am having seems to be an issue regarding data. Nevertheless, please move this question to the appropriate section if this
 is not the place for it.</p>

<p><span>If there is, without other ways, you also can try to extend this E drive to fix this low disk pace problems.

<p><span>Simply use partition resizing software and add enough free space to your E drive.

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail - Messages disappear after 8-12 weeks or so</h2>
                    <p>I <strong>know</strong> you have to have the setting to sync all messages "any time". &nbsp;And I have that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nonetheless, after about 2-3 months any email in my Inbox or in a Folder just disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to sync the folder, I get a message that there is no email in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, this means that if I book a trip more than about 6 weeks in advance, my confirmation code is gone before the trip even starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop this? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;I was showing you how to archive an email. I use Outlook as my main email account which is synced to the mail account, everything I do in Outlook is duplicated in Mail. I delete most things straight away that's why my email is nearly always blank. If I
 receive an email in my Outlook account that email will also be in Mail, when I delete it from Outlook it will be deleted from Mail. That's why Outlook also shows in Mail. You're already using it just carry on and implement the things I have shown you. There's
 nothing more I can tell you, It'll soon be second nature to you. Good Luck.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>

<h2>            OpenGL error in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem... When i try to play GrowTopia or MineCraft, it says, to update my OpenGL drivers. I have Windows 10. My graphic card is a chipset : Mobile Intel Graphic Media Accelerator X3100. What I have to do to solve this problem? Maybe the OpenGL
 isn't supported to this graphic card on Windows 10 or what? On Windows 7 it was working perfect. Please help!</p>

<p>I bet your computer runs the 32 bit version of Windows 10. I myself am on Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>Right click on the windows thingy in the left bottom corner, then click on system. A little bit below the processor info, you'll see the System Type stuff. So, If you have the 32 bit version, it'll say this "32 bit operation system, x64 based processor"
 Just switch to 64 bit. How to : Search for "Windows Update"(Idk If it will pop up as Windows Update Settings or something, but whatever.), Once opened, you'll see "Activation" Just click on "Change product key" and do what the computer tells you. Hopefully
 this will work for you. If it works, try to search for me on Growtopia, I have the same name there.</p>

    <title>Hissing sound on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> givemyemailbackthiefs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hissing sound on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I never had this problem on windows 7; it started the day i installed windows 8.<br />
My laptop starts to make a hissing sound, very low, when i open some programs. I already noticed this happening with 2 programs: GrabIt (newsgroups program) and PowerPoint Viewer 2010 from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Any idea what's causing this?<br />
Hardware problems? Don't think so, started the day i installed windows 8 and only happens using some programs.<br />
Drivers? If so, why does this happens with those 2 programs and not with the others?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
EDIT: I replaced the word whining for hiss. English is not my primary language... :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just installed chrome and the hiss is present when i open it. <br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the below methods and check the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let’s follow the steps from the following link and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
<b>No sound in Windows</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue,
 as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the
 option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click
 ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right
 click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes
 that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes
 that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem,
 the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to let us know. It is our pleasure to be of assistance.</span></p>

            Thanks for replying.<br />
Shortly after i edited my post i found out what was causing the problem.<br />
I have a asus laptop, and one of the programs available is&nbsp; power4gear, which is a utility used to switch between power plans. I had the latest version, that is windows 8 compatible (Power4GearHybrid_<b>Win8_64</b>_Z204). I removed that application and now
 the hissing sound is gone. <br />

    <title>MS Malicious Software Removal Tool &#40;KB890830&#41; while running - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Malicious Software Removal Tool &#40;KB890830&#41; while running said found Infected Files, when Finished reported No Infections Found&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the current McAfee antivirus engine on my Windows 7 laptop. Nevertheless as my laptop is often painfully slow I decided over the weekend to download and run on my laptop “MS Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830)”.</p>
<p>I ran a ‘Complete scan’. It took the whole weekend to run and during this run-time and just before it finished it reported “File Infected:
<span>&nbsp;</span>35”.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>35”.</p>
<p>However immediately after the complete scan was finished the final report stated;
“No Infection Found”.</p>
<p>(The detailed breakdown scan reported list for all elements “No Infection found”).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in the “MS Malicious Software Removal Tool” log (C:\Windows\debug\mrt.log), it also (with the correct time/date) reported “No Infection Found”.</p>
<p>Note also there was no mention at all of the 35 files that during runtime it reported as infected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI; also I discovered the msert.log log in the same folder. This is the “Microsoft Safety Scanner v1.0, (build 1.257.615.0)” log. (That I did not know I even had on this laptop!). This log of Microsoft Safety Scanner” that was auto ran the<span>&nbsp;
</span>week before also said ‘No infections found”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also (just-now) ran and completed the “MS Malicious Software Removal Tool” for a second time, but this time in 'quick-scan mode'. This time during run-time it reported “File Infected: 0”. Thus nothing found!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my simple questions is:-</p>
<p>Is it normal that during run-time the “MS Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830)” will report finding infected files, however immediately after it has finished it than reports; “No Infection Found” for everything ?</p>
<p>Perhaps I might assume that the complete scan after it finished auto cleaned/removed the 35 infected files! Hence also why the 2<sup>nd</sup> time I ran this tool in ‘quick-mode’ during run time it also reported No Infected files found! However surly during
 the original full-complete scan final report it would have told me it had cleaned/removed these infected files in the GUI of this tool and in the mrt.log ?</p>
<p>Of Course there is the possibility – that if I do have a virus on my pc, this virus is clever enough to also change the final report and log?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brgds</p>
<p>Denis</p>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
Here are a couple tips when working with windows in Windows. :-)<br />
<br />
1) If you close a window maximized, it will open maximized.<br />
2) Windows remembers the size and placement of a window upon close. <br />
3) There are a couple exceptions. Some programs might have a 'setting'. The PROGRAM Icon properties may be set to open 'maximized'.<br />
4) When 'moving' a window, you can click-hold-drag on any 'free space' on the top bar to move it.
<br />
5) You can resize a (not maximized) window by clicking on the edge and dragging in or out. Corners rezise both connecting sides.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. (sorry in advance&nbsp;if this is below your knowledge level)

Depending what program you were refering to .....<br />
Right click on the program &gt; Properties &gt; is there a Shortcut tab ? If yes, click it &gt; look for RUN. Click the pointer at the far right, and select Normal Window &gt; Apply/OK<br />
<br />
Now open that window. Does it open in Normal size ?<br />

            Thank you so much for asking this question! I HATE THIS FEATURE!! It never did it before then all of a sudden, every time I resize a window and move it over...POOF...back to big! grrrr<br />
<br />
I have mulitple large screens and I work with different programs and windows side by side...so this is VERY frustrating!

            Obviously this isn't resolved as I have the same question and it's 2013.&nbsp; I really really hate this feature, it is so frustrating when you have multiple windows open and you can't drag without maximizing the window.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Very stupid idea Microsoft, when are you going to fix this?<br />

            Why would that be a perfect answer in a Windows Vista group as Vista does not have that setting. Get a brain.

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t let me write numbers</h2>
                    Every time I try to log in it won't write numbers.&nbsp; Num Lock does not work, neither do the numbers that are above the keyboard, those would just write the symbols only. Caps lock will write in lower case and vice versa.&nbsp; I've seen allready that it's a
 common problem.&nbsp; I have a laptop btw. <br />

How can I fix this problem?

<h2>            Problem adding contacts to favorites</h2>
                    I am trying to add contacts. I went to contacts, typed in the correct name in the search field and found the person I was looking for. However there does not seem to be a way to add to my favorites. I right clicked on the name and 3 options come up but
 "add to favorites" is greyed out and I can't select it. What should I do?

</p><p>It seems the contact you are trying to add in Skype is not a Skype contact at all.</p>

    <title>BSOD screen due to graphic drivers in Windows 8.1 - Dell Precision - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zarvak  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD screen due to graphic drivers in Windows 8.1 - Dell Precision M2400</h2>
                    Hi, I'm just upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro. Everything seemed fine. I started for the first time and, after a while, I got a BSOD telling me abut a VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE... looking around I saw this same problem with Windows 8 Preview... (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/hardware/videotdrfailure-on-dell-m2400-laptop/9267d09c-8e5e-4778-a12b-00fb024abd4e?msgId=8801391f-a71c-4bd1-973c-c4a1e8eefc38
 ) but it was a thread closed.<br />
I can't go back to Windows 8 because the upgrade was succesfull!... and I cannot log in but in Safe mode... My graphic card is a nVidia Quadro FX 370M. I have the last drivers released for that card... don't know what to do...Is there any way to solve this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

            I lost almost all the minidumps as I reinstalled everyting again starting from Win8 and going to Win 8.1. It gave an error in the end of Win 8.1 installation but it attempted to recover... changed something atumatically and it succeed. Then I uninstall
 all NVidea drivers (from Device Manager and from Programas) and unchecked the option in System -&gt; Advance System Settings -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Device Installation Settings so to not allow Windows to update drivers automatically. From then on, my system is using
 the Microsoft Basic Graphic driver. It's not as smooth as the NVidia but it works and it doesn't crash (2 days working now without problems...).<br />
<br />
I have what I think is the minidump generated when it failed in the last installation:

            Since you've done the above and haven't crashed, you likely simply needed to just update your video card drivers from the manufacturers website after the upgrade (NOT Windows Update). Please try installing nVidia's drivers again from the manufacturers
 website and not Windows Update.<br />

            That was the first thing I did with no luck.
<div>I'll wait till the release of a new version to try again.</div>
<div>By the way. One weird thing I see is that there is no stand by option in the power button.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Could it be a collateral effect of not having the right graphic drivers?</div>

To confirm, you might want to follow these steps to try installing the driver in Windows Compatibility&nbsp; mode:<br />

<li>Uninstall the driver from the Device manager. </li><li>Right Click on the setup file for the driver. Select <b>Properties</b>.</li><li>Under <b>compatibility </b>tab, select “<b>Run this program in compatibility mode for</b>” and choose the operating system on which it worked properly previously or the version of Windows for which the driver is available. (You might want to check with<b>
 Windows 7</b> or <b>Windows Vista</b>)</li><li>Select <b>Apply </b>and then on <b>OK</b>.</li><li>Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the driver.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know about the results. <br />

            Today I upgraded my Video driver to Driver version 332.21
<div><br />
<div>This version and my previous version (331.82) work fine with external monitors. &nbsp;However as soon as I open up the laptop and switch to the standard laptop screen I will get a BSOD within minutes no matter what application I am running. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I &nbsp;am even running multiple monitors and it operates fine as a desktop PC...unfortunately it will not operate in laptop mode. &nbsp;Once it goes into BSOD mode it becomes a continual reboot to-do loop. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For others in this nightmare...I also found I had to disable sleep mode. &nbsp;On the control pannel settings I have set sleep to never. &nbsp;I just need to remember to hit the sleep button on my keyboard. &nbsp;Going into sleep mode was causing a BSOD in desktop operation
 on version 331.82. &nbsp;I have not tried turning sleep back on yet. &nbsp;</div>

</p><p>Now that you have that, here is some background. My sister told me she had upgraded to Windows 10 before she gave it to me.
<br />
<br />
I didn't check to see which edition I had because I figured it was Windows 10 Home, as is usual.&nbsp;<br />
Upon checking a short time ago, it said that I had "Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview," but that will be further elaborated on in a second.<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><br />
The main issue is that my computer has been severely lagging and freezing randomly when I watch a stream of video, or play a video game.
</strong></span>&nbsp;It is still somewhat responsive when it does this, yet it is very slow, the audio is distorted, and the video will lag and freeze for ten seconds or more when it does this.<br />
I have updated my drivers countless times and they don't help. It still does it no matter what. I have read all of the forum solutions and what to do, and what to download. No Avail.<br />
</p>
<p>I even<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> tried to use a Media Creation Tool</span> to reset my computer to a normal version of Windows 10 Home, but it did not work and wouldn't let me overwrite my files, so all it did was upgrade/repair what was already
 existing, which naturally didn't do much because there was nothing to upgrade. <br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How do I know I have this version?</span> When I open the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Intel HD Graphics Control Panel</span> and go to the Information Center, that is what Operating System it lists. When I go to PC Settings, Update and Recovery, Advanced Options, it gives me the option to receive pro builds
 etc.<br />
</p>
<p>So, I had to figure out what to do, because I know that this version of Windows is supposed to be unstable, and for making apps and whatnot and testing.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I made an account with Get Insider Preview Builds.</span> I did this because I read in another forum that people who had this version would get a free complete version of Windows 10. So, I made one, verified it, and installed
 the four or so updates it gave me at the time. I don't remember exactly what, but one of them was Build Version 1511, or 1565, but I don't think it was the latter.&nbsp;<br />
After I did that, I opened the panel again, and it said I had Windows 10 Home, and nothing else.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Naturally I was elated, and so I quickly signed out of the Insider Preview Builds, opted out of it, and restarted my computer like it told me. I checked again when I opened it, Windows 10 Home. Problem solved, right? Wrong.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My computer still lagged a while after while I was watching a video. Not as bad as before, but still unresponsive, freezing, and all of that nonsense. I went to update my Graphics Driver for the sake of it. &nbsp;I opened
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Device Manager</span>, right clicked on my Graphics Driver, and I updated. Simple. I went to the Intel Graphics Control Panel again,
<strong>and after that update for my driver installed, it said my operating system was ONCE AGAIN Windows Pro Insider Preview!!!
</strong>The opposite of what I wanted!! I panicked and rolled back the driver, checked again, and it said Windows 10 Home after rolling back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What does this mean? Please help me. I just want my system to run fine, and I want a normal version of Windows 10 Home, and I'm desperate for answers. I will answer any questions to help this along, but I am so desperate and the computer warranty died a few
 months ago!!! Thank you in advance.</p>
