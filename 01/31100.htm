                    <span>I have just installed a new NAS device, the NetGear ReadyNAS Duo, firmware v. 4.1.6. There are four "Users" set up on the NAS, and, commonly, two laptops using the home network. One is a Vista 32-bit Dell, the other a Windows
 7 64-bit Sony. I have set up several shares on the NAS, all but two of which are "public,"
<span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span> , anyone with access to the network has access to the shares. The other two shares have access limited to two of the NAS "Users." I have been able to map the "public" drives on both computers without incident. I was
 also able to map/connect to the "private" shares from one of the two laptops, but not from both. I have been able to do this, after a factory reset suggested by NetGear tech support, from either laptop, but each time, I cannot access the "private" files from
 the other laptop. I receive the error message:<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
"\\[NAS NAME]\[SHARE NAME] is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permission.<br />
<br />
Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again."<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
I have looked at the following articles: <a href="http://home.bott.ca/webserver/?p=346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bott.ca/webserver/?p=346</a> and <a href="http://home.bott.ca/webserver/?p=275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bott.ca/webserver/?p=275</a> , and have tried (a) making the User name on the NAS the
<span style="font-style: italic">same</span> as those for a user account in Windows; (b) making the User name on the NAS
<span style="font-style: italic">different</span> from those for a user account in Windows; (c) logging in to the "second computer" (<span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span> , the computer that cannot access the "private" shares) as the
<span style="font-style: italic">same</span> User as on the "first computer" (<span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span> , the one that can access the "private" shares); and (d) logging into the second computer as a
<span style="font-style: italic">different</span> (but also authorized) User as on the first computer, and nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Several sources, including the "Bott Blog" article, suggest a workaround involving either (a) having one user log in using the host name for the NAS server, and the other using the IP address, or (b) creating a series of aliases
 for the host server. I can't use (a), both because the folks at NetGear tech support have said that I should use DHCP to set the IP address (so it will change periodically) and because I have more than two users. I'd like to try (b), but all the posts seem
 to assume that "everyone" knows how to set up this series of aliases, and unfortunately I fall outside of "everyone." I've tried, so far without success, to find on line how one might set up such "alias" names.<br />
<br />
By way of example, the Microsoft Support article posted at the end of the Bott Blog article states:</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>"Create a different Domain Name System (DNS) alias for the remote server, and then use this alias to connect to the network share.<br />
<span>"Create a different Domain Name System (DNS) alias for the remote server, and then use this alias to connect to the network share.<br />
<br />
After you use one of these methods, you can use different user credentials to connect to the network share. In this situation, the computer behaves as if it is connecting to a different server."</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The problem is that is doesn't tell you <span style="font-style: italic">

Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I had already tried updating the firmware, for both the NAS and the router, to no avail.&nbsp; It turns out the the issue was likely one of naming/DNS conflict.&nbsp; When I re-mapped the password-protected network drives using the IP address rather
 than the NAS name, the problem seems to have been corrected.&nbsp; Thus, mapping the network drives, either via the net use command or through Windows 7's drive mapping, to
<span>\\ip address\share name<span> was successful, but mapping to
<span>\\NAS name\share<span> produced the "multiple connections" error identified above.&nbsp; One note:&nbsp; this solution requires reserving an IP address on the router for the NAS drive, so that the mapping remains correct.<br />
<br />
For more detailed discussion, please see the following:&nbsp; (<span>http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=38659<span>).<br />

Thanks again.<br />

<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>

<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run SFC scan. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files and

            Your best option is to copy your text into a professional word processor and spell check if there or use Grammarly in your web browser to check your spelling.

It should skip the patching/updating part til you go back online. Might make a difference.&nbsp;</p>

Just have 2 games downloading at a time and the one you want to download make sure that is the one which is downloading at all times. When the download cancels be patient and keep clicking resume all whenever one of the downloads cancels. If only the one you
 want to download cancels then pause the other one and keep resuming all until the one you wanted to download starts working. I am doing this now so i can guarantee you that it works.</div>

            You may want to try uninstalling the game or whatever has downloaded so far. Then clear local saved games ( dont worry you wont lose anything) Then install again, it sounds like a corrupted download&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 errors&#63; 0x8007002 &#38; 0x81000203&#63;</h2>
                    <p>These two errors are stopping me completing any back-ups, and also stopping me setting a restore point, I have tried all I know to fix this problem, but noting seems to work. 0x8007002 &amp; 0x81000203, I do not know what these error numbers stand for?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also on an earlier problem I asked about; I am unable to load any programmes from DVD/CD's, as there is no auto run or any way to set it up. &nbsp;This is most essential to my writing and websites updating. I have a back-up computer, but unfortunately there is
 not enough space to take all my files etc.; only the files I keep in reserve.</p>
<p>HELP!</p>

<h3> perryatsef  say:</h3>
<h2>            lost use of touch screen on tablet</h2>
                    I have a hp t 1000 z cto tablet notebook. I recently used the recovery cd to reinstall Vista and downloaded all the updates from Microsoft and HP. I lost functionality of the touchscreen when I did the reload. I've searched the HP site, MS site and the
 web and can't find out why the touchscreen doesn't work. I have all current drivers installed but Vista doesn't see the tablet and thinks there is no tablet. I don't know if I am missing a piece of software or need a different driver. Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Perry

            Perry, did you use the recovery disk that came with your PC or was this installation done from a retail disk?<br />
Check if you have any BIOS settings that might effect this.<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Check Device Status and Driver Version:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Device Manager</span><span> by
</span><span style="font-style: italic">clicking</span><span> the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> button,
</span><span style="font-style: italic">clicking</span>
</span><span style="font-style: italic">clicking</span>
</span><span style="font-style: italic">clicking</span>
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</li><li>
</span><span style="font-style: italic">double-click</span><span> the name of the device.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Check the </span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">General</span><span> tab. Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Driver</span><span> tab, check
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Driver Provide</span><span>,
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Driver Date</span><span>,
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Driver Version</span><span>,
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Digital Signer</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Device</span>
Manager</span><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
<span><br />
Also see if there are any Unknown Devices listed here, if so see if windows can locate any drivers for it. Check with HP to see if you tablet uses specific drivers or relies on ones supplied in the OS.</span></p>

            Rami,<br />
I ordered the recovery CD for my specific pc from HP. To answer your questions, I went to device manger and looked at the drivers for each of the following under Human Interface devices:<br />
1. Wacom HID Digitizer:&nbsp;&nbsp; driver is Microsoft 60.6000.16386, 6/21/2006, driver details say "no driver files are required or have been loaded for this device"<br />
<br />
2. Wacom HID Pen:&nbsp;driver is Microsoft 60.6000.16386, 6/21/2006, driver details say "no driver files are required or have been loaded for this device"<br />
<br />
3. Wacom Virtual HID Driver: driver is Wacom 2.8.0.0, 2/14/2007, driver details say "Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility".
<br />
<br />
Should I look at any other categories in Device Manager? Also, I don't know how to look at bios or change those.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, when I go to Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Tablet Properties and click on Set Up Your Pen and Tablet I get a little pop up screen which says "A supported tablet was not found on the system." And there is onlo an ok button which closes the
 pop up. <br />

            Perry, I am not able to locate your exact model PC on HP's website, please confirm that the one you provided is accurate (make sure that there are not any numbers / letters missing), look at the bottom of the PC and check the model next to&nbsp;product ID and
 Serial number.<br />
<br />
Let's see if we can force an update for your tablet drivers, although your drivers list as Wacom, a notice on Wacom's website states that HP 1000 pcs do not use Wacom, this might be a generic driver that windows is picking up.<br />
<br />
Did your device work in the past or is this the first time you are using this PC?<br />
Did the tablet come included with Vista or XP? which one does the restore disk include?<br />
<br />
<p>I recommend that you check with HP to see&nbsp;if your&nbsp;tablet does infact use the&nbsp;Wacom drivers.<br />

            Rami,<br />
My computer model is HP Pavilion tx 1000z cto. It was actually HP that advised I download wacom drivers. I just&nbsp;restored my original Vista Home Premium software from the recovery cd HP provided for my model. The original software on this was Vista. After recovery
 I continue to have the same problem. Touch screen does not work. I no longer have wacom drivers, though. I have the default Vista drivers.
<br />
<br />
Perry<br />
&nbsp;<br />
also, drivers listed are:<br />
Human Interface Devices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HID Compliant Device<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HID Compliant Device<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HP Quick Launch Buttons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USB Human Interface Device<br />
Keyboards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HID Keyboard Device<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard PS/2 Keyboard<br />
Mice and other pointing devices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HID-Compliant Mouse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synaptics PS/2 Port Touchpad<br />
<br />
I wonder if its related to one of these.

            Righto Perry, I've cracked it!! (for mine any how)<br />
go to&nbsp; Start &gt; Run <br />
Type "services.msc" and click OK<br />
now find "tablet PC input sevice"<br />
Right click and click properties<br />
Chage startup type to "automatic" and click "start" <br />
You should now have use of the touchscreen!!<br />
Oh but I still go by my statement below that I don't think you have a Wacomm touchscreen and you should do the driver steps I outline below.<br />
<br />
Happy writing!<br />
<br />
********previous post, edit due to finding my answer*******<br />
Perry,<br />
I know that HP said to download Wacomm drivers but it wouldn't be the first time they have gotten this wrong! There is an issue with the driver on HP TX1000 models, which I haven't got or found an answer for. But am fairly certain that Wacomm didn't make your
 touchscreen. <br />
<br />
I would recomend going into device manager and uninstalling the HID compliant mouse, then look at the properties for the HID compliant devices. All the ones for Quick launch buttons clearly say "Quicklaunch" on the properties tab. If it doesn't say Quick launch
 then uninstall it as it will be the HID for the touchscreen (HID devices have 2 locations in device manager).<br />
<br />
Right, now shutdown the laptop (would love to now say install ubuntu as the screens work with this but hey ho . ..) and restart. Let vista find the drivers&nbsp;it needs. You should have your HID- mouse back in control pannel but hopefully with the right driver<br />
<br />
If it still doesn't work, go to control panel &gt; Mobile PC &gt; Tablet PC settings. (in classic view you just click "tablet PC settings")<br />
I know you said you have been to the tablet settings and got error message but hopefully with the new driver it might let you in . . . . .
<br />
In this window you will see a&nbsp;"calibrate". Click this button and follow instructions.<br />
Does it let you calibrate? If yes but you still get no use in windows, then you have the same issue as me and hundreds of other HP tablet users.<br />
Sorry

    <title>WINDOWS XP BLINKING CURSOR ISSUES - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WINDOWS XP BLINKING CURSOR ISSUES</h2>
                    I have Windows XP desktop. I have a master &amp; slave hard drives. When I startup my computer it shows a black screen with a blinking cursor in the corner. I would normally just re-install the XP but I have VERY important information and don't want to lose
 it. I started it up and went to recovery but still can't get it back. Is there a program or software I can buy to get my files back? I was told to buy a "cable" that would eliminate the use of switching jumpers (something I know nothing about). PLEASE HELP!!!!!!
 I am not a computer pro, so can you use plain english (I know how to cut it on and turn it off)

    <title>Surface Pro 2 sudden shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonic_spike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 sudden shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 and I typically use the Type keyboard, have an SDXC card in the slot, and run on AC.&nbsp; Sometimes I switch to battery and often also use "Balanced" when I do.&nbsp; These are the primary states of my Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention this because regardless of the power state, I have random shutdowns that are very hard to track.&nbsp; I have discovered that the shutdowns happen ONLY when I have Facebook open, so I think the problem lies there, with some sort of catastrophic memory
 leak and/or bad script.&nbsp; I don't have to be using Facebook when it happens.&nbsp; The screen goes black, and the next thing you know I'm seeing the startup screen.&nbsp; Every once in a while I get the blue startup repair screen, but if I continue normally, all works
 just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the reason this is hard to track:&nbsp; no BSOD, no memory dump, nothing in the Event Viewer beyond the typical startup messages when it comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this one thing, the Surface Pro 2 has worked like a charm--no overheating, no battery problems, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried already to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Update the Media Card reader drivers using the specific manufacturer driver from Realtek (before I knew this was Facebook-specific)</p>
<p>2) Deleting temporary Internet files in case a cached&nbsp;object from the Facebook site&nbsp;was bad</p>
<p>3) Removing any software not necessary to my day-to-day use (like the Java client, for example)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd love to hear back from people are either:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>a) suggestions to try (besides a factory reset--I'd really have to be desperate before I throw away all my efforts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) if you're having sudden shutdowns and you use Facebook, let people know here if they only take place when Facebook is running</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts, comments, and suggestions welcome and appreciated. :)</p>

            <p>Zack, I've got the answers, and I think you deserve the credit for the solution.&nbsp; If you want to re-post the following, I'll mark it as the Answer all official-like, and
<em>thanks very much for your help</em>!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>A script-heavy website--in this case, specifically Facebook--may in some cases cause the Surface Pro 2 to completely shut down and restart.&nbsp; This will happen without warning and typically occurs when the website in question is open and running in the background.&nbsp;
 The problem happens specifically when using the 'desktop view' version of Internet Explorer, running in standard mode,&nbsp;and does not happen when using other brands of browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Modern UI version of Internet Explorer will avoid the problem.</p>
<p>Using another brand of browser for Facebook, such as Chrome or Firefox will avoid the problem.</p>
<p>Running Facebook in the desktop-view version of Internet Explorer&nbsp;can also work when using&nbsp;Compatibility View.&nbsp; Telling Internet Explorer to run Facebook in Compatibility View&nbsp;solves the shutdown problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable Compatibility View for Facebook in the desktop view version of Internet Explorer:</p>
<p>1) Navigate to the website</p>
<p>2) Click the Settings icon in Internet Explorer (upper right-hand corner, looks like a cog) to bring up the Settings menu.&nbsp; From the Settings menu, choose
<strong>Compatibility View Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3) The "Add this website" blank will contain the website address.&nbsp; Click the <strong>
Add</strong> button to add it to the list of sites that Internet Explorer will run in Compatibility View.</p>
<p>4) Click<strong> Close</strong>.&nbsp; The site will now run in Compatibility View every time it is loaded.</p>
<p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Thanks, however, I have been able to run Syncback schedules in both Vista and 7 using blank passwords before (because I am a single user and don't need any password) so this can not be the case. Is there a misunderstanding maybe?
</p>
<p>Again, how to find Local Security Policy in 7 Home Premium, if possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Please post your method in case you succeed in running a scheduled task under an account with a blank password.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium lacks a policy editor. You can duplicate many of its operations by hacking the registry directly, using this voluminous spreadsheet as a guide:

    <title>Xbox One - Pantalla negra tras encender con mando - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One - Pantalla negra tras encender con mando</h2>
                    
<p>Hola,</p>
<p>Hace un mes que tengo la consola nueva y va perfectamente. El pasado día 6 de Febrero de 2015 se produjo la última actualización de la interfaz con transparencias.<br />
Desde la actualización de la consola y el mando, al encender la consola desde el mando (En modo Ahorro de energía) ocurre lo siguiente:<br />
1- Sale la pantalla verde con el Logo de Xbox One<br />
2- La pantalla se queda negra durante un tiempo indefinido<br />
3- Vuelvo al pulsar el botón Xbox del mando, y entonces aparece en pantalla el logo de blanco de Xbox sobre un fondo oscuro y entonces entra en la interfaz.</p>
<p>Esto solo ocurre iniciando desde el mando, desde la consola entra a la interfaz directamente y sin ningún problema. He contactado con el servicio técnico y he realizado la prueba de pulsar el botón 20 segundos y desconectarla de la corriente pero sigue ocurriendo.<br />
Esto no me imposibilita iniciar desde el mando o darme problemas al jugar, pero es algo mosqueante y quería saber si a alguien le pasa después de haber actualizado la consola.<br />
<br />
Un saludo y gracias :)</p>

<p>Hola . He intentado lo que usted dice, en mi caso, aun con el ahorro de energía activado la consola inicia normalmente, con lo siguiente: Pantalla verde-Negra-El logo de Xbox-El saludo y a la interfaz sin ningún problema.</p>
<p>Tambien lo probé con Inició rápido pero todo bien.</p>
<p>Esperar a que se solucione, o a ver si alguien también tiene este problema.</p>

            <p>Hello Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows files. This may also happen if related service is not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check if "<strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong>" service is
<strong>running </strong>as set as <strong>automatic</strong>. </p>
<p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + R keys</strong>, type <strong>services.m</strong><strong>sc
</strong>in <strong>run </strong>window and press Enter.<br />
b. Right click "<strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong>" and click <strong>
properties</strong>.<br />
c. Make sure that <strong>service status </strong>is <strong>running </strong>and
<strong>startup type </strong>is <strong>automatic.</strong><br />
d. If not, select <strong>startup type </strong>as <strong>automatic </strong>and click "<strong>Start</strong>".<br />
e. Click <strong>apply </strong>and <strong>ok</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

<h2>            WIn 10 Video TDR Failure &#40;nvlddmkm.sys after Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7 Pro.&nbsp; Since then I've been getting the Video TDR Failure (nvlddmkm.sys) error when I exit Sleep Mode.&nbsp; Prior to upgrading to Win 10 I never saw this error.&nbsp; Within the last 24 hours it is happening more frequently than before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only get the BSOD and error message when I wake up the PC from Sleep mode.&nbsp; While I am using the computer everything works fine.&nbsp; Most of the time I just browse on the Internet, use Outlook, PowerPoint and a writing program called Scrivener.&nbsp; I occasionally
 use Skype.&nbsp; I don't do a lot of work with videos or what I consider to be graphics-intensive things.&nbsp; I normally do not leave a lot of programs up when I am done working on the PC, usually just Skype and Scrivener, so I don't know what would be causing the
 driver to stop functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran msinfo32 to get the following information on my PC.&nbsp; I hope this is enough.</p>

<p>--------------------</p>
<p>I've read multiple posts on this failure.&nbsp; I deleted and reloaded the driver through the Device Manager, and it says I now have the most current one.&nbsp; The driver disk that came with my video card is from ZOTAC, so I went to their website to see if I could
 find a driver but I couldn't find my card listed.&nbsp; I image that is because it is an older graphics card.</p>
<p>I followed a tutorial that showed me how to use the REGEDIT tool to create a new directory and an entry to turn off that 'Lock Screen' picture in case that was somehow causing the problem, but that doesn't seem to have any affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search for 'NVIDIA Geforce 9800 GT drivers' and found this on the NVIDIA website.&nbsp; According to the long list of supported products, my card falls under the Geforce 9 series.&nbsp; However, O/S listed does not include Win 10.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; I read about trying to install the driver in a compatibility mode (I assume with Win 7 Pro, since that is what I had before).&nbsp; I don't want to try that until I hear from MS Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is everything I can think of to help you.&nbsp; If there is more information you need, pls let me know and I will add it to this post.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Colorado,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It appears that you are getting an error Video TDR failure on the computer. This happens most often when playing graphic intensive games or when playing high quality videos.&nbsp;It&nbsp;can also happen with any process that uses a large amount of graphic
 resources, such as when editing or creating videos. TDR is the Timeout, Detection, and Recovery component in windows. When the graphics device gets too low on resources and stops responding, windows will attempt to recover by restarting the graphics device.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I appreciate the troubleshooting steps that you have tried. I would suggest you to install the latest graphics driver from the manufacturer website and check it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: P</span></strong><span>erform <strong>Automatic Repair</strong> once again using Windows 10 installation media. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Automatic repair can detect
 and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t have an installation media. I request you to download and create an installation media of Windows 10 from the below link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download Windows 10</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the steps below to perform an <strong>Automatic Repair</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Insert the installation USB media and boot Windows Technical Preview from it.</span></li><li><span>In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer’ </strong>and select ‘<strong>Troubleshoot’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select ‘<strong>Automatic Repair’ </strong>and select the operating system.</span></li><li><span>You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>and select <strong>advanced options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You may choose <strong>Automatic Repair </strong>from Advanced boot option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the instructions.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Per your advice, I asked ZOTAC (the manufacturer of my NVIDIA card) to help me find the latest drivers.&nbsp; They directed me to the NVIDIA website and I downloaded the driver file "341.95-desktop-win10-64bit-international".&nbsp; I ran it and tried to do the standard
 install, but the install failed.&nbsp; I ended up turning off my Comodo Firewall (not sure if that had anything to do with the failure) and did a custom install and checked the box to do a 'clean' install, and the install procedure worked.&nbsp; I will have to wait
 and see if that will solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does not, I will re-execute the file in Compatibility mode for Win 7 and see if that solves the problem.&nbsp; If that doesn't solve it, then I will try the Windows Repair procedure you recommended.&nbsp; When it seems I have fixed the problem, I will edit
 my original post so that you and other viewers can see what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Information about this particular error often states that it is usually caused by graphics-intensive processes, such as editing video files.&nbsp; I don't do what I believe is graphics-intensive stuff, and prior to upgrading to Win 10 from Win 7 I never had
 this error with my current graphics card. &nbsp; The only time I see the issue is when I am coming out of 'Sleep' mode, so perhaps the error is being caused by something else.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother (who is much more savvy about Windows that I am) also recommended that I turn off the 'Sleep' mode and just have the monitor and hard drive power down after 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; He says he never used the 'Sleep' / 'Hybernate' modes.&nbsp; Considering
 that the only time I ever got the error was when I tried to wake the PC out of 'Sleep' mode, there may be something to that.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed the link and did the 'AUTO DETECT YOUR GPU'.&nbsp; It detected my card, listed the most current driver for the card and displayed the version I currently have and they are the same, so it appears my NVIDIA drivers are all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the time being I have disabled the 'sleep' mode on my PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am not going to use it for a while, I just shut it down.&nbsp; I find restarting the PC actually takes a lot less time than recovering from the BSOD error.</p>

TDR Failure (nvlddmkm.sys. &nbsp;This occurs every time I sign on the the PC and only after the Win 10 update. &nbsp;I do not need to do anything but sign on and it soon goes to a blue screen. &nbsp;I am not doing anything.
 &nbsp;If I do not sign on it can sit with the sign on screen and no problem, but once I sign on and have my desk top I get the blue screen in less than two minutes. &nbsp;I have had this issue for months and it renders the PC useless so I use my Ipad instead, &nbsp;but need
 a solution. &nbsp;Can I get a remote sign on by MS?

    <title>Vista doesent support Firewire anymore&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> top-1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista doesent support Firewire anymore&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello im getting pretty tired of having to fight Vista on every turn.<br />
<br />
Since an update some time ago my Firewire external HDD, My FireDTV-S and my Firewire camera is not found by windows vista on a normal boot up where units are connects to the PC.<br />
I have tried following fix from MS without any luck.<br />
<br />
To work around this problem, for non-compliant IEEE 1394a devices, configure Windows Vista to enumerate inactive IEEE 1394 devices. To do this, follow these steps:1. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Contro l\Class\{6BDD1FC1-810F-11D0-BEC7-08002BE2092F}\ControllerInstance<br />
In this path, ControllerInstance represents the controller instance number. For example, this number may be 0000.
<br />
3. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value. <br />
4. In the New Value #1 box, type EnumerateInactiveLink, and then press ENTER. <br />
5. Right-click EnumerateInactiveLink, and then click Modify. <br />
6. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If when the PC is started up i dont see the device in device manager, i the unplug and replug the devices and voila Vista finds new devices.<br />
<br />
Now i dont want to have to unplug my hdd, or floppy dtv everytime i boot my PC. so whats up with Vista can i get a fix or refund the darn thing is a constant problem.<br />
I have also a Ubuntu and a Windows XP home ed. and i have tried moving my things to thoose machines and reboot warm and cold 100 times without any issues at all just Vista wont support Firewire anymore unless i unplug and replug after boot.<br />
<br />
I had to be sure so i made support tickets with Asus for MB N4m21-E and WD hdd and Digital everywhere for the issue and after extensive trouble shooting they all point to VISTA as the cause to the problem.<br />
<br />
Now can we get a fix or can someone tell me how to fix this, this is not random issue its constant since 1-1½&nbsp;month ago after auto patching system.<br />
<br />
All drivers are the most recent, beta drivers testet on all devices but without any difference they are just not detected.<br />
<br />
Sitting with a Kubuntu cd and XP pro CD in my hands and im ready to quite vista for good, but hey i might be surprised by this forum.<br />
<br />
Thanks for anyhelp.<br />
<br />

I am sorry you are having issues with Vista.&nbsp; Let's see if we can find a permanent fix for you.&nbsp; I noticed you listed the recommended registry fix in your original post - did you complete those steps?&nbsp; Because that is the recommended fix for the issue of Vista
 not correctly enumerating IEEE1394 devices.&nbsp; There are a couple more kb articles that address firewire issues in Vista which may, or may not help you, but I wanted to include them in case you have not tried these:<br />

            <p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is mainly caused due to BIOS outdated and chipset outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have to revert back to the earlier operating system using the rollback option, if you are unable to acess this option, you need the installation disc for Windows 7 or 8.1 to revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the computer is reverted back, visit the computer manufacturer website and install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers&nbsp; and then upgrade to Windows 10 using&nbsp; the below ISO link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></p>

            <p>This problem of flashing screen after downloading Windows 10, could not be &nbsp;solved by a professional IT expert. After working 2 hours on it we decided to reinstall the old Windows 7 version. With this all my programm files with software that I paid for like
 NITROPRO ETC where lost. Could not be reinstalled &nbsp;because you can only use the installion key once.</p>
<p>The whole excersize costed me 200 USD cash and one full workday lost.</p>
<p>MICROSOFT I believe you should &nbsp;be asshamed for bringing out software again which is not suffient tested. Besides you should handle the &nbsp;question on this issue do not leave it to the social media. Many people have this same problem!</p>

<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you originally upgraded from Windows 8.0 to Windows 8.1 through the store, you should have ensured that Windows 8.0 was activated.</p>

            <p>Hallo,</p>
<p>I too get the Error Code: 0xC004C003.</p>
<p>My situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Bought Dell Inspiron 15 laptop with Win 8.1.</p>
<p>After setting it up activation has failed.</p>
<p>Tried to activate automatically over the phone and it has failed.</p>
<p>Tried the method you suggested above but this was again unsuccessful and key could not be generated.</p>
<p>Was advised to contact MS support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my laptop has a small erroneous entry in the BIOS. Model number instead of Inspiron 5547 is displayed as 5447. Wouldn't this result in different checksum and therefore perhaps I will never be able to register Win 8.1 with UEFI and secure boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is the case and root cause of my problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, should I install a completely different operating system or would just switching to MBR/non secure boot be enough to register Win 8.1?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Keat,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So long as you have downloaded it from the official website then you can install the full version of SP1. See this link from my website for more details:

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. As I understand your message, I can directly install Windows Vista Service Pack 1 "Download from Microsoft" without install so many updates through windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After install Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and when is complete, of cause I&nbsp;need to restart my Laptop and than I can directly install Windows Vista Service Pack&nbsp;2 "Download from Microsoft" then finally I do the rest of the updates through windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keat</p>

            <p>Hello Keat,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes first install Windows Vista Service pack 1 ( you cannot install SP2 unless you already have SP1 installed.) After installing SP1 restart your PC and then proceed to install SP2. Any updates after SP2 will be installed as normal through Windows Updates.</p>

            Means that your account is not an admin account.
<br />To check that go to start - settings - accounts 
<br />See if your account is listed as an administrator.
<br />If not, then go to start - settings - accounts - other people
<br />See which account has administrator rights and login with that account.
<br />Then logged in with that account go to  start - settings - accounts - other people and click your account and give yourself administrator rights.
<br />Should work after you log back in as yourself.
