    <title>Defaul service setting Windows 10 pro 1803 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> infiniteplayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Defaul service setting Windows 10 pro 1803</h2>
                    Hi I am looking for a list of default settings to work from. I have been working from a list a few years old, so many new services, not on this list.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a default settings page? As Microsoft goes into orbit with its lists of services and running protocols it would be real handy to have a map and some system defaults to work from.
<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated.<br />

            Hey Steve,
<br />
<br />Not officially by Microsoft there is a list, but BlackViper contributed to such, you can read his extensive list here: <a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-10-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/service-configuration...</a>
<br />
<br />Everything's included, defaults in each edition as well as some quick notes, in 1803 as you requested.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<h2>            MY laptop was stolen, what to do.</h2>
                    hello my 1 month old laptop with windows 7 was stolen, it was a gateway laptop. I have filed a police report and proof of purchase with gateway. However, i do not know my windows 7 key of the top of my head because it was on the bottom of the laptop, the
 original gateway box does not have this information either and i contacted gateway and they said they cannot give me the key because "dispatching of windows 7 OS is done by mentor media. I recommend you contact Microsoft".<br />
<br />
The reason im asking is, I am going to build a new computer and i thought instead of paying for windows 7 again why not use the copy i already payed for when i bought the laptop? is this possible? I put my gateway "recovery dvd's" in my current desktop and
 i got to the screen where it asks language and the notice where it says "if you press continue everything will be restored to original factory settings", IF i put those recovery dvd's in the computer i build will they install windows 7 on my new computer?
 is there somehow a way to transfer over the key to the new machine?<br />
<br />
In addition i have a broken dell laptop out of warranty, too expensive to fix, which has a windows vista key on the bottom, can i make use of that somehow?<br />
<br />
Thankyou for all of your answers.

Sorry to tell you that the answer is no. You have an OEM copy that <br />
came with your computer, and the biggest disadvantage of an OEM copy <br />
is that the license for it ties it permanently to the first computer <br />
it's installed on. It may never be moved to another.<br />

<br />
No, it's not.<br />
<br />
First of all, an OEM license must be sold with a piece of hardware <br />
(normally a motherboard or hard drive, if not an entire PC) and is <br />
_permanently_ bound to the first PC on which it's installed. An OEM <br />
license, once installed, is not legally transferable to another computer <br />
under _any_ circumstances.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if the OEM DVD was designed by a specific manufacturer, <br />
such as eMachines, Sony, Dell, Gateway, etc., it will most likely be <br />
"BIOS-locked" to install only on the same make/model computer for which <br />
it was designed, as an additional anti-piracy feature.<br />

    <title>Blue circle over the network icon on sturtup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sophie999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue circle over the network icon on sturtup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Win 7 64 bit Ultimate, ASUS MB, gen 3 quad&nbsp;Intel Core i7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started getting blue circle over the network icon on sturtup, lasting for 10 min, during which the computer has very limited functionality. I use wired connection, and before it would detect network immediately. After 10 min, I get red
 cross over the connection, then a few min later it connects and functions just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. msconfig - unchecked all sturtup item - still have issues.</p>
<p>2. ---------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- went to services and unckecked all of the non-MS services - still have issues</p>
<p>3. safe boot - looks fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue comes up NOT every sturtup, but probably 4/5 times. Safe boot seems to fix it.&nbsp; So, I think it is related to MS process, something that is not loading in safe mode, but how do I isolate the process that is responsible??? I cannot seem to figure
 out how to see which services that would normally load are not loading in safe boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sophie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue with the network icon on startup.</span></p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to this question to assist you further.</p>
<p>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system<span>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to uninstall and reinstall the network adapter:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<b>Start</b> and type in <b>Device Manager</b> in the Start Search and Press
<b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Expand the
<b>Network Adapters</b> in the Device Manager </span></p>
<p><span>c.
<b>Right click</b> on the device and click on <b>Properties.</b></span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on
<b>driver tab</b> and click on <b>Uninstall Driver</b> and click
<b>OK.</b></span></p>
<p><span>e. Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer to the computer or device manufacturer website and try updating the latest version of network card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the articles:</span></p>

 and wireless network problems</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have tried to disable startup items and services, you may try to
</span><span>temporarily disable the third-party security software and firewalls installed on the system and check for the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If disabling the antivirus software fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus program accordingly. Please contact the software vendor for further assistance
 in this regard. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Make sure to enable the
 security software on the computer after checking for the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Start Menu, Cortana, Mail, sticky note, calculator et al. not working. But other software, works ex. google chrome, MS Words, etc.</h2>
                    <p>It started when my anti-virus detected a malware. installed CCleaner, and a adwcleaner to clean it, and ended up cleaning the registry multipe times. After that, start-menu stopped working, cortana, mail,&nbsp;and all windows app, but google chrome, skype, and
 other applications are working.<br />
Tried restarting, not working either. I suspect its something to do with the Registry Editor where some critical files were deleted. Any way to restore it?<br />
Steps Tried:<br />

<h2>            New computer and can&#39;t get HP Photosmart C5180 All-in-One Printer to install and work</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded what I think is the correct driver and soft wear.&nbsp; I had to get a new computer as my other one crashed,&nbsp; I can't install the softwear that came with it because I now use windows 7.&nbsp; However it worked in windows 7 on the other computer.&nbsp;
 I need my printer and scanner.&nbsp; I keep getting not responding or scan error if&nbsp; I get past the not responding.</p>
<p>Where do I need to go from here?</p>

            There are free scanning tools that may work better if the printer is twain-compliant.&nbsp; IrfanView is a good image editor that also can scan images.&nbsp; See if that works any better.&nbsp;

            <p>Your post was off-topic for the Feedback forum.&nbsp; I moved it to the Windows 7 "Hardware and Drivers" forum.</p>
<p>The WIndows 7 driver for yout printer is here: <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software11/COL30777/mp-76232-1/AIO_CDA_Net_Full_Win_WW_130_140.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you have the printer connected directly to the PC, install the driver first.&nbsp; If it's connected via a network, the software will look for it, so make sure it's online.</p>

            Some of those removed were guests and I understand that as guest accounts expire after 24 hours. However, the two examples I posted in my original question were NOT guest accounts, so I cant really understand why Skype has removed them... anyway I will
 try and add them back in again from my end.

<p>To the best of my knowledge, you can only keep a person in a SKYPE conversation if its just you and another user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more then just 2 participates; they are free to 'leave' when they close the window on their end.&nbsp; If you want to keep people in a conversation, you will have to manually monitor participants and add them back into the conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is part the reason why I must resort to emails; no need to worry about replying to a message and having people automatically removed from the message.&nbsp; SKYPE only seems to be persistent and function correctly if you are just talking to (1) person.</p>

    <title>Installing Windows on Separate Internal SSD with another Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjkroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows on Separate Internal SSD with another Hard Drive containing Windows 10 Install on same PC</h2>
                    I have 2 hard drives connected to my motherboard. One hard drive (SSD) is brand new and doesn't contain anything on it (completely wiped). I have a second hard drive that contains an installed copy of Windows 10 with a bunch of files. I want to install
 Windows 10 on my new 1TB SSD and make that primary boot device. I don't wipe the other hard drive before installing because I want to copy my files over later. After Windows 10 installs on my SSD and I copy my files from my existing hard drive to my new SSD,
 I'm then ready to wipe the existing hard drive clean so I can clear all of the windows files off it. So I format my existing hard drive clean (using the disk utilities on the Windows 10 install setup process). I close out of the install process and try to
 boot to my new SSD alone and I get a "Cannot find bootable device" message. Which is strange because I would have thought that when I installed Windows 10 to my SSD originally, it would have created its own boot sector on the disk.
<p>
</p><p>Some observations of my own: </p>
<p>I noticed originally after I installed Windows 10 on the SSD that I was seeing multiple Windows 10 installs on 2 volumes on the Windows Boot Manager menu. Which I know is usually the case for installing multiple windows on the same device (hard drive) but
 not on 2 separate devices. It seems to me that Windows appended the new boot option to boot manager on my existing HDD to contain both Windows installs instead of creating its own boot option on the SSD device. I looked through a bunch of resources to see
 if I could try reinstalling Windows on that existing HDD and then append the boot option again but that didn't work. I also tried doing the BootRec.exe from the Windows 10 install disk and the B</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up backing up some of my files to an external drive and ended up wiping both disks and installing on the SSD. It works as expected now but I find it odd that I had to do this in the first place. If anyone has any thoughts of why I lost the option
 to boot from my SSD after wiping my existing hard drive then go for it. </p>

<p>That's exactly right. I think its dumb this problem exists in the first place. There should be an installation step asking if I want this installation to be appended with an existing volume or if I want the install to be on its own and have it not be included
 in Windows Boot Manager. If I say no to the prompt, I should then be able to have my PC boot to my SSD and Windows should start up like normal. I don't think the boot device should be dependent on Windows Boot Manager as it does now.
</p>
<p>I think I also found a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-bootrec-fixboot-access-is-denied/747c4180-7ff3-4bc2-b6cc-81e572d546df">
solution</a> to why the BootRec /FixBoot didn't work which might have fixed my boot problem.

<h2>            Blurry images&#47;icons on browsers, windows 10, dpi scaling problem</h2>
                    <p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows10 (version 1607)</li><li>Resolution 1980x1080 (HD)</li><li>Monitor laptop touch screen</li><li>Size 125% / 150%</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Principal issue:</strong> all the images and icons on browser are blurry, tested on Firefox, Chrome and Edge. Follow a screenshot<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1ba305-e358-4257-b55b-396829b509fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1ba305-e358-4257-b55b-396829b509fa" /></a></p>
<p>Banally the browser goes zoom at 125% and the images goes to blur. Is Not ammissible and without a sense.<br />
I have read some forum in the last week and many people have a similar problems<br />
I think it is a problem of DPI scaling. I set my machine to use dpi scaling of windows 8, it's work for some apps but not for the browser.<br />
<br />
Help us to get windows 10 to use DPI in the right mode.<br />
I wait for some feedback<br />
<br />
Thanks for support</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<strong>Notes:</strong><br />
Set windows at 100% size is not a fix or an answer. The people don't use an HD monitor to work with small app, fonts etc.<br />
The people want sharp resolution!

</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to calibrate the display and then check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press the <strong>Windows key.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> Then type <strong>calibrate your display.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> In the next instructions window, you can make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with Windows in future. </p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for quickly response.<br />
Calibrate helps but not resolve the problem.<br />
Sharpness is different. For example if I plug another monitor (no HD) the icons are better (1° line of image), for me is very strange.<br />

<br />
I remain of the idea that is a problem of DPI scaling.<br />
This issue is not known in Windows 10 development?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the display driver once and check if it helps you.
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to the manufacturer's website and download the latest display driver from the website. Then follow the steps given below to uninstall the Display Driver.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Press <strong>Windows Key + X key</strong>, click on
<strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b) Search for <strong>Display</strong> <strong>Adapter</strong>, right click on it and then
<strong>uninstall</strong> it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now install the display driver and check if it helps you. Get back to us with the status of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver, but nothing changed.<br />
I remain of the opinion that is a DPI problem, I think that Windows 10 works bad with DPI in this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow another screenshot:</p>

<p>I called HP support twice but nobody helps me for now. They tell me that a windows problem.<br />
<br />
I hope someone releases an update to fix the problem.<br />
I wait for some feedback<br />
<br />

            <p>This is a major bug in Windows 10. The internet is full of posts with people trying to find a solution, but it really comes down to one thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can only be fixed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the scaling level to anything above 100%, even on HD monitors with powerful graphics cards, upscaling causes blurring of text and icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An excellent example of why it is a Microsoft problem, and not the problem of software developers, is if you set your scaling level to something more than 100%, then open Windows Services (services.msc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is blurred. The text, the icons, everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works to fix this. Scaling in Windows 10 is broken, how do we get help when Microsoft won't even really acknowledge that this is a serious bug.</p>

</p><p>Hi Sachin, </p>
<div><br />
I bought a laptop at the end of 2012 in America and I use it in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
<br />
In the first year I had no problems. </div>
<div>
<p>Afterwards freezes sometimes, once in a month and in the last month every two or three days, sometimes daily.
<br />
Problem was present in the win 8 and win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I realized that I want to get into safe mode and do a clean boot and I did. <br />
<strong>I'm not sure what I'm supposed to see there</strong> but there was no error in the event viewer.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the SFC scan did not find any problem or change.</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for the answer.</div>

<h2>            Skype 8.30.0.50 on a desktop Is Not Ready for Prime Time - Classic shutoff on November 1 is unacceptable&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Skype 8.30.0.50 on a desktop Is Not Ready for Prime Time - Classic shutoff on November 1 is unacceptable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed 8.30.0.50 and checked it out.&nbsp; I then sent in feedback.&nbsp; It has moved in the right direction a little bit, but it is not yet ready for desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic shutoff on November 1 can't happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two main things in my feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't split the panes, which also means you can't have multiple chat/call panes open at once - something I use constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way the V8.3 lists are displayed is insane.&nbsp; In my Classic Skype I have one Contact list. Favorites at the top followed by active Skype Contacts followed by phone only contacts followed by inactive Skype Contacts.&nbsp; Then there is the Recent tab that lists
 chronologically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Classic shuts off before they fix these items, I will then be dealing with an almost totally unworkable for my desktop Skype app.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes - and everyone who needs Classic V7 Skype to keep running needs to do Feedback, constantly to attempt to drive home the message.&nbsp; There is a feedback link on the Help menu as well as the Feedback Hub in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            NAT settings help.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have played Xbox Live for a while now and recently I have been having some NAT issues.<br />
In matchmaking, it always says that my NAT settings are moderate. When I open my router settings,
<br />
the UPnP is enabled and I was confused. So I turned the UPnP off then back on again. I reset my Xbox<br />
and now I have an open NAT. However the problem that I am having is that it goes back to moderate NAT<br />
for an uknown reason. It seems to go back to moderate after I turn off my Xbox&nbsp; for a couple of hours and
<br />
then return to it. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi David,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the issue, Maintenance scheduler does not work properly as it shows an error prompting “maintenance scheduler is unavailable”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to gather some information on this issue to help you further:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1) Do you refer to Automatic Maintenance scheduler on Windows 8 when you say “maintenance scheduler”?<br />
2) Have you disabled the Automatic Maintenance check on the computer?</div>
<div>3) What is the exact/complete error message that you get whne you try to run maintenance scheduler on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
If you are referring to Automatic Maintenance scheduler on the computer, I would suggest you to check if the scheduler is turned OFF.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Type <strong>Maintenance </strong>on the start screen.<br />
b) Click on the<strong> settings </strong>option.<br />
c) Click on <strong>change automatic maintenance settings</strong>.<br />
d) Check the box which says “<strong>Allow scheduled maintenance to wake up my computer at the scheduled time</strong>”.<br />
e) Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to check if the task scheduler settings to perform maintenance have been disabled. If so, please make sure to enable them. You can follow the steps to do so:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a) Type <strong>task scheduler </strong>on the start screen<br />
b) Click on <strong>Task scheduler</strong>.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Microsoft </strong>folder on the left panel of the window.<br />
d) Click on <strong>Windows</strong>.<br />
e) Click on <strong>Task scheduler</strong>.<br />
f) Right click on <strong>Ideal maintenance </strong>and select <strong>enable</strong>.<br />
g) Right click on <strong>Regular maintenance </strong>and select <strong>enable.</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if you are able to run the maintenance check on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Trying to fix automatic repair loop on windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to fix automatic repair loop on windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony VAIO Laptop&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model : SVF152C29L</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both "Refresh your PC" and "Reset your PC" Does not work. I get this when I try&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f835c1-aed7-4c08-a42f-59ab8c87b21c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f835c1-aed7-4c08-a42f-59ab8c87b21c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I even have tried to re-install windows (8.1) using a bootable USB but I can't figure out how to actually get it to boot-&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking it's my BIOS which is this<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74bacfe8-0b97-4e39-9c20-0be7fabd413c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74bacfe8-0b97-4e39-9c20-0be7fabd413c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole reason why I'm trying the bootable USB thing is to see if it's my hard drive that's corrupted or Windows it's self so I actually try to begin to fix it- because if it's the drive then I can simply get a new hard drive but if it's Windows then I
 can fix it by this method maybe?</p>

</p><p>The first link where it tells you how to reset a VAIO laptop is the same method I did to try to reset my computer but it didn't work which I provided a image(The first image) of what happen when I attempted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>both the second and third links that are about the create installation media- which I have already downloaded and used on it's own and did not work to (didn't boot at all)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the forth and fifth links about creating bootable USBs do provide more information- To create bootable disk for UEFI it has to be 64bit? I've been trying to use the 32bit way- could that be why my computer wont boot the USB? I'm unsure if my computer
 is 64bit or 32bit... how do I find that out if I can't even get into the computer due to the Automatic Repair Loop??</p>
