<h2>            monitor fonts windows 8 fuzzy and no longer crisp</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer One D250 Netbook and a LG Latron W2246S Monitor, they both worked all ok with Windows 7 Starter and Home Premium. Since upgrading to Windows 8 the fonts are fuzzy and no longer crisp. I have reset the monitor to defaults and ran Clear Text,
 and it is still the same, I have also uninstalled the drivers for the monitor and the display driver and updated the drivers to the latest using Microsoft drivers for the chipset and the manufactures for the Monitor and it is still the same. Please could anyone
 suggest anything - other than this issue I am loving windows 8 - even though it is on an Netbook it is really fast and really improved the feel of the Netbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            A lot of people are having the same problem. <br />
<br />
The font rendering in Windows 8 was changed. Unbelievably, parts of Win 8 like IE10 don't even adhere to the Win 8 font rendering schema, hence the blurry fonts.
<br />
<br />
There a numerous threads about it.<br />
<br />
So far, the suggestions offered by Microsoft are so have been infantile.<br />
<br />
Microsoft need acknowledge there is serious problem and get to work and fix it.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. </span><span>Also thank you for the feedback which you have provided for Windows 8, these inputs are considered as high priority.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before upgrading to Windows 8, we recommend that you run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. It scans your current PC to see if it is ready for Windows 8 and then provides a compatibility report and optional steps for you to buy, download, and install
 Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>I</span></strong><span> would suggest you to un-install and re-install graphics card driver from the manufacturer’s website on your computer in Windows 8 by choosing the compatibility level as Windows 7:</span></p>
<p><b><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the Program Compatibility Wizard</span></b><span>, by pressing
<b>Windows key + W</b> and then type <b>Control Panel</b>, </span></p>
<p><b><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span>Click <b>Programs</b>, and then clicking <b>Use an older program with this version of Windows</b>.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Windows 8 Consumer preview drivers are not available on the website however, may try to download Windows 7 drivers from the website and then install them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            I have a brand new laptop preinstalled with Windows 8 and IE 10. On top of the infantilising torture of Windows 8 design, the blurry font 'feature' heaps insult over injury. It is so bad it beggars belief. After 20 years with Internet Explorer, I have
 finally switched permanently to other browsers (unfortunately I am stuck with windows 8). Life is too short for subjecting your brain to the strains of technological 'progress' gone mad.

Its is ironic,&nbsp;but perhaps&nbsp;the threat of legal action for eye-sight damage might be the only thing that wakes Microsoft up from its corporate stupor.

            <p>I take exception to the tone of this reply.&nbsp; You imply that it is the customers' fault (by not following the instructions to&nbsp;run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant) that we are having problems with blurred fonts.&nbsp; Well, I beg to differ.&nbsp; I, too, like several
 others, use a brand new laptop that is PREINSTALLED with Windows 8 and IE 10.&nbsp; Therefore, the problem IS NOT of the customers making.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have called the "Support" center [note the word support is in quotes, because of its misnomer].&nbsp; I was told I would have to pay $99 for them just to look at my computer through remote access.&nbsp; They suggested the problem lay with the manufacturer and the
 sent me a link to Toshiba support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon clicking on the link at the Toshiba support site, I ended up ...... back at WINDOWS 8 SUPPORT.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one wants to take responsibility for Windows 8 problems.&nbsp; You try to pass it off on the customer, the manufacturer,
 - or how about the shipper that delivered the unit? - or the brick and mortar store where we purchased the computer or the Windows 8 program - or the online vendor that sold it to us?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;wrote the code for the program,&nbsp;Microsoft designed this mess,&nbsp;Microsoft has&nbsp;marketed this fiasco as the best think since electricity (but did a very poor job of providing online tutorials, manuals, etc until just lately), so ....&nbsp;Microsoft needs
 to provide the&nbsp;support to us for&nbsp;the fix - at no cost to the customer.</p>

            <p>Found a way to give feedback on the rendering technique change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;1076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;1076</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the base of the feedback survey there is a section where we can tell them about the issue.</p>
<p>This will likely be our best bet of getting the text rendering improved, or maybe even ClearType support for the new products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to @WindowsSupport for providing the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can get enough people sending feedback on the issue, we may just get this fixed.</p>
<p>I'll post this on a few other posts, I will miss heaps so if your up to it, post it wherever you think it'll help.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An e-mail account that I have used for years is suddenly being blocked because the age I gave in then is now underage.</p>
<p>I have to prove my age or give parental permission. I am of age btw</p>
<p>But the only ways to prove my age seem to be</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>provide VISA card info and pay (not doing that in a million years)</strong></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Screenshot:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Also, most people don't even have a VISA card, I only happen to have one because I have traveled to the US. It's not a common thing here. So this is all quite unfair.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ul>
<li><strong>email them a copy of my ID card</strong> </li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">okay this is sketchy af too. An ID card copy can be used for a lot of official business and contains private information and I'd rather not share.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">However I wanted to try it anyway, but I need to sign in to send an email, but I can't cause "I'm not of age" -&gt; big vicious circle here.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Still, I'd really rather not send them my ID. Is there a way I can use another account to verify this one? (without sharing my VISA)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

            Hi <strong>Julie</strong>,<br />
<br />
Microsoft takes measures to verify that an adult is giving a child authority to use a Microsoft account. Verification via a credit card is the most common method that is being used. You may need to submit proof of age if you can't use a credit card. Please
 refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Age verification for parental consent">link</a></strong> for more information regarding
 age verification for parental consent in using a Microsoft account. <br />

<h2>            Razer Kraken Pro - Microphone not working - Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>EN- Google Translate</p>
<p>I bought my headset Razer Kraken Pro to use in my console Xbox One, his sound is very good and works well with the stereo adapter from Microsoft, but the microphone does not work. I tried to contact Xbox support via Twitter , but they could not understand
 or find some solution.<br />
I searched the internet is now the default CTIA headset, but the microphone still does not work, and the problem is caused by the fact that the Kraken Pro is compatible with iPhones , where the microphone system is different and patented by Apple, resulting
 in problems compatibility on Xbox One.<br />
The strange thing is that it works perfectly on the Playstation 4. I do not understand anything about compatibility of those things, but I believe it should be an easy problem to solve, if Microsoft wanted to do.<br />
While we expect the long awaited solution, there is an adapter I found on Amazon and Ebay, to name "MUYHSMFF
<span>Startech 3.5mm 4-pin to 2 x 3-pin 3.5mm Headset Adaptor - M/F"</span>, so googled that can solve the problem, I made a purchase but have not received for testing, so I reach back and put my experience here. I belive&nbsp;it may also work for other types of

<p>I Hope I helped.&nbsp;Sorry for bad english.</p>
<p>PT-BR</p>
<p>Eu comprei o meu headset Razer Kraken Pro para usar em meu console Xbox One, seu som é muito bom e funciona bem com o adaptador stereo da Microsoft, mas o microfone não funciona. Eu tentei entrar em contato com o suporte do Xbox via Twitter, mas não conseguiram
 entender ou encontrar alguma solução.</p>
<p>Pelo que pesquisei na internet o fone ja é padrão CTIA , mesmo assim o microfone não funciona, e o problema é causado pelo fato de que o Kraken Pro é compatível com iPhones , onde o sistema de microfone é diferente e patenteado pela Apple, resultando em
 problemas compatibilidade no Xbox One.<br />
O estranho é que ele funciona perfeitamente no Playstation 4. Não entendo nada sobre a compatibilidade dessas coisas, mas eu acredito que deve ser um problema fácil de resolver, se a Microsoft tiver vontade.<br />
Enquanto esperamos a solução, existe um adaptador que encontrei na Amazon e Ebay, chamado " MUYHSMFF Startech 3,5 milímetros de 4 pinos para 2 x 3 pinos 3,5 milímetros Headset Adaptor - M / F", que pode resolver o problema , efetuei a compra mas ainda não o
 recebi para testar, assim que chegar eu volto para repassar minha experiência. Acredito que também pode funcionar para outros tipos de headset com o mesmo problema.</p>
<p>Espero ter ajudado.</p>

<h2>            Drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have IE 11 in Windows 7 Home Premium. Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU T7200 @ 2.00GHz 2.00 GHz. RAM: 2.00 GB. System Type: 32-bit Operating System. Service Pack 1. After running&nbsp;the Troubleshoot Hardware and Devices function, I get the message "Intel(R)
 946GZ Express Chipset Family has a driver problem-ID: ROOT\DISPLAY\0000. Then I go into Device Manager and under the Properties tab, I get a Device Status message that reads: "This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required
 for this device (Code 31)" Then I perform the Windows Update and I get the message: "all drivers are up-to-date"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help I can get!</p>

<p>Have you gone to the PC or Device's Support Downloads webpage to see if there are newer drivers than those installed in Device Manager on Driver tab?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The affected driver may be part of the chipset if this is a motherboard with onboard Display, or it may be a separate Display driver for the Video card or chip.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did right to first check WIndows Update but if it's not offering a newer driver I'd install
<a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel® Driver Update Utility</a></p>
<p>to see what it recommends to download and install.&nbsp; If this isn't successful then manually search from the specified chipset drivers on the Intel site to see that they're updated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this check the installed Display driver in Device Manager on Driver tab.&nbsp; If it's still problematic choose Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Choose to see what other drivers have been installed to see if one of those works better.&nbsp; If not report
 back the latest installed Driver by it's device make/model, version number and date.&nbsp; We can help you find a better driver.

<p>1st,youre ram memory should be increased,4GB is max for 32Bit..Next,intel specifically says that the pc chipset</p>
<p>software be installed 1st,then the 946GZ software/driver,after that update Direct X,direct x 2010 redistribute is</p>
<p>the best,dwnload it,create a new folder,open direct x,extract to new,once thru,open new,scroll to bottom,double</p>
<p>click on the installation icon,rest is auto.As for intel,go to intel.com/support/drivers-software/browse,select</p>
<p>chipset/edit the 3 columns.Or at download page,type in 946GZ chipset</p>

<p>PowerISO may have been used to unzip the driver but isn't needed in the System tray meaning it starts with Windows.&nbsp; Nothing needs to start with WIndows except Windows and a lean anti-virus like Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>This is a brand new computer.</p>
<p>All updates were done via the HP support assistant.</p>
<p>There are 4 different failed windows 7 professional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Once you view a failed update within update history how do you manually try another update for the same failed update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)Why would a clean boot alter the windows 7 professional updates? &nbsp;Is there a program on boot that blocks certain windows updates and not other windows updates? For this step after msconfig would I just hide all Microsoft and then uncheck all boxes for
 a selective boot and then click on windows updates? &nbsp;or would I somehow search for updates and attempt one at a time? &nbsp;What is the most efficient way to find these 4 failed updates to attempt to download and install them again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)The Microsoft fixit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7 &nbsp;was run. &nbsp;When it finished I did not notice anything. &nbsp;I then went to windows updates and ran it. &nbsp;There were no new updates. &nbsp;Was it
 supposed to find the four failed updates or was I supposed to somehow manually retry the four failed updates? &nbsp;In other words windows updates did not display these 4 updates as being available to download and install. &nbsp;These 4 failed updates only appear in
 the windows update history. &nbsp;Only one of the four had failed twice. &nbsp;The others have only failed once. &nbsp;How do you reattempt download nad installation of specific updates when they are not displayed as new updates?</p>

<br />
It defaults to the download folder. But you can change it. When you get the dialog box showing you it's going to the download folder, just change&nbsp;the destination&nbsp;before you press OK.

<h2>            Windows 10 frozen in Settings</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: help needed Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to Windows 10. My computer seems to have frozen in the settings area - can't move mouse etc. Used to be I could do a control-al-delete and get out of my predicament. This does not seem to work with Windows 10. Is there an alternative? I have an
 older HP Compaq Presario Model CQ60-615DX 64 BIT 4GB RAM Service Pak 1. I'm sure I could pull the battery but is there something else I can do?Thanks, Ldy Jane</p>

<h2>            Logged into Another Guys Account, Can&#39;t Make Another.</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I had to reinstall Windows 10 on my computer. I pulled my windows 10 usb out, and reinstalled it. When it finished, I was logged into a guy's account (I'll call him&nbsp;Pablo, for his privacy). I would make another account, but&nbsp;Pablo
 isn't an administrator, and the only admin account is 'RetailAdmin'.&nbsp; RetailAdmin is password protected, and I need to be logged in on him to make another account. I figured that Pablo works at Microsoft (since everyone listed in contacts shows as a worker
 in Microsoft). What in the world do I do?

            Hi Bjsummers 
<br />
<br />Somehow your system has been linked to 'Pablo's' Microsoft Account in error. 
<br />
<br />Honestly, the only thing to do, is to clean install Windows 10 again, to remove those users from your PC.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Inteli Type Pro 7.0 software lists my keyboard, however, when I chose it from the list it will not let me configure the keyboard and keeps defaulting to a Wireless

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My OS is windows 7, 32-bit

<p>I would suggest uninstalling and reinstalling again.&nbsp; This time though don't select your 5000 series from the list, but use the Generic "Wireless comfort Keyboard".&nbsp; I have not tested it on Windows 7, but trying to figure out your actual issue/error and
 recreate it is hard without more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think to fix your Hot keys, you then need to run the program InteliType "Start &gt; Microsoft Keyboard &gt; Microsoft Keyboard"&nbsp; It will be a little different on 7 to find it in the list, but currently on XP.&nbsp; When this program opens you will see a tab "Key
 settings" and then be able to change any hot key along the top.&nbsp; I don't use the Control panel feature because it will only show the first 2 tabs compared to the software.&nbsp; I use InteliType Pro 6.3, and without having this keyboard in I can change the hot
 key settings.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps and if you post more details into what your trying to accomplish, and if you get any error messages it would help trying to recreate the error.&nbsp; If you get to the right windows and its greyed out a screen shot also helps sometimes.</p>
<p>My other post goes through the steps</p>

</p><p>Now, let's try to reset your Windows Store cache and check.</p>
<p>To do that:</p>

            Hi Player000594992, that is a Realtek device driver causing that issue, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Player000594992
<br />
<br />Both minidump files indicate RtkHfp.sys as the root cause. RtkHfp.sys is your Realtek Bluetooth device driver, you should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the Bluetooth driver they recommend for your device

<p>Thanks Dave and Sumit</p>
<p>I went to the HP website- my HP laptop is registered with them. The Bluetooth driver they have listed for my computer is a Broadcom driver, not Realtek. I know that my current driver is from Realtek, as you stated. So I'm not sure what drivers I should be
 installing. If Realtek, then which one? I'll try to get an answer from the HP forum.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the error you have posted it seems as though the game is trying to add a firewall exception for online play and is having an issue loading the dll for
 that specific part of the game.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue you are experiencing could be related to permissions for installing the game. Please make sure that you have Administrator rights to install the
 game and all associated files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The issue you posted is related to Age of Empires and would be better suited in the Age of Empires support community. Please visit the link

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />Personally at my  place of business, we use 1 key for everything. This includes profession plus 2016, server 2016, windows 10 enterprise, and windows 10 enterprise LTSB.  This is most likely the best way to pay for it.

<p><span>Hi Zach! </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the response. When people leave your company do you reuse the license key? If you don’t have unlimited keys, then how do you keep track of how many are in use with Microsoft?</span></p>

            It is simply 1 key. This is an enterprise thing. when they leave, we dont take the "key" back because we already have it. 
<br />
<br />My advice to you is this: Licensing out 250 machines is difficult and theres no straight answer as to how to do it. You need to contact a Microsoft partner and get information on how to do it from them. 
<br />
<br />Warning: this kind of stuff can get difficult. Theres audits every year, every 3 years we have to buy new keys, etc. Like I said, your best bet is contacting a Microsoft partner about it.

            While true, this needs more context. Yes you need a volume license, but with 250 machines, you need to get in contact with a Microsoft Partner, go through audits, etc. We have over 300 machines. Buying individual keys is not the best way to do it and honestly
 their probably isn't a best way but using 1 enterprise key for all your machines will be the easiest possible way to keep track of it.
