<h2>            Rosewill DVD&#92;CD drive &#40;TEAC internals&#41; problem, I&#39;d really like help</h2>
                    Looking for help solving a problem regarding a Rosewill ROD-EX001 (TEAC DV-W28S-R) USB external drive.&nbsp; Put a CD or DVD in, wait approximately 3 minutes before the drive spins up and shows the autorun prompt on screen.&nbsp; With some applications, and the
 drive, that worked fine in Vista SP2, this Windows 7 64-bit full and new install on the following hardware:
<br />
<br />
Shuttle SX48P2- Deluxe <br />
Intel Core 2 Quad<br />
8 GB RAM<br />
2 raptor drives in raid 0<br />
2 ati 4850 cards in Crossfire<br />
Rosewill ROD-EX001 USB external<br />
<br />
Lists the DVD or CD contents.&nbsp; Upon clicking on the application to run, sometimes it runs, other times it returns that it is an invalid 32-bit or 64-bit application message (even though this software installed fine on Vista SP2).&nbsp; If I get lucky this goes away
 after rebooting.... However, if it is a multi-disc install, for some reason the drive contents do not refresh, and it still thinks the first disc is in the drive, pressing F5 to refresh or ejecting the disc does no good.&nbsp;&nbsp; It lists the disc contents and the
 disc header information unless I leave the drive empty and reboot.<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me figure out this perplexing problem and get it fixed, I'd greatly appreciate it, as it's very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Additional notes:<br />
<br />
There is no firmware updates for the drive at the TEAC site, nor at Rosewill for the drive.<br />
<br />
There is no third party manufacturer driver for the drive.<br />
<br />
I do not have any CD burning software installed.<br />
<br />
This drive has a USB cord with 2 usb ends (one plugged in for drive connection, two plugged in at the same time for CD burning) - I have tried both during my troubleshooting, no change either way.<br />

            So far I've checked on the following possibility of fixes for this drive issue on the internet.<br />
<br />
One solution is remove any upper and lower filters in the registry.<br />
<br />
As this is a new install with all updates with no burning software installed, I have none.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's database suggests running the troubleshooter in the control panel, I have done so, and the compatibility options as well as any drive installation error fixes that the troubleshooter has attempted has made no change in my problem.<br />
<br />
Again, I'd like input from anyone else regarding the fix for this problem, as it is very difficult to install software at this point with the above mentioned problem.

            This was working on the Vista that was installed on this same computer before windows 7 was installed, and the drive is on the exact same port in both cases, so I'm having a hard time believing that the port is bad.&nbsp; The options listed on the link you
 provided do not apply well as the device is identified properly, and does work to some extent, it is the refresh problem that is the issue.

            Any other suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp; I find this to be the drive or its firmware that I can determine (leaning toward the firmware), as another drive works around it according to other posts on the internet.&nbsp; However I do not have the funds to purchase a new drive
 at this point, and seeming how it was working in vista is very perplexing, when all of a sudden it doesn't work in the windows 7 install.

<h2>            How OneDrive Syncs between Multiple Clients and the OneDrive Server</h2>
                    <strong>Technical Level</strong> : Intermediate <br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
Describes how OneDrive communicates and syncs changes between your PC, phone, Xbox, and tablet and describes the basics of real-time co-authoring based on the Office Web Apps.
<br />
<strong>Details</strong><br />
<p>OneDrive is Microsoft's consumer cloud storage and collaboration tool and is designed to sync content between all of your devices connected your Microsoft account. Technically, cloud storage, or cloud computing is defined as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Cloud computing is a phrase used to describe a variety of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected through a real-time communication network such as the Internet.[1] In science, cloud computing is a synonym for distributed
 computing over a network, and means the ability to run a program or application on many connected computers at the same time." --
</em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive is just one of these "distributed computing" environments that also communicates with your client devices, i.e. your phone, computer, laptop, and tablet. The term "the cloud" has evolved to include software as well,&nbsp;allowing users to interact&nbsp;with
 and securely share their content, for example, Office Web Apps or Google Docs editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Client-Server Relationships</p>
<p>OneDrive is designed around the basic client-server computing model. Basically, the client (your computer or device) initiates conversation with the server (OneDrive) and requests information. The server fulfills the request by sending&nbsp;requested data back
 to the client. The OneDrive applications request directory structures, file names, and image thumbnails from the server to provide a view of your files and folders. (graphic from Information Technology Services, University of Hong Kong
<a href="http://www.itservices.hku.hk/news/ccnews125/p2p.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.itservices.hku.hk/news/ccnews125/p2p.htm</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6fcf2d0-b12f-48ee-b01b-e48dd5d26efc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Changes and updates are submitted to the server, always initiated by the client device, and new material is regularly downloaded. All communication is initiated and all information is requested by the client device. This basic structure helps facilitate
 OneDrive and create a collaborative environment for consumers and applies to every application that communicates with a server, including Google Drive, OneDrive, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">OneDrive Syncing Process</p>
<p>OneDrive syncing follows a very simple, established process when updating information from the server.&nbsp;When you modify or add&nbsp;information, the client (your device) sends an update request to the server along with the updated&nbsp;information. The clients also
 regularly check in with the server comparing file versions and updating as necessary. Your client device will&nbsp;either&nbsp;download&nbsp;or send new or updated material.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you update a Microsoft Word file on your computer and save it to the OneDrive folder on your computer. The OneDrive program immediately scans and records the new file and any other metadata to send to the OneDrive servers. It initiates a connection
 with OneDrive servers and requests to upload information on the server, finally uploading the content. OneDrive adds the new file to it's database and any device that syncs with OneDrive will download that new file.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Real-Time Co-authoring</strong></p>
<p>Syncing with OneDrive becomes more complex when using live editing through Office Web Apps and other browser-based live editing tools (Google Docs does this too). Essentially, the client-server model described earlier is changed slightly and the OneDrive
 server will "push" updates to the clients, reducing communication and internet traffic. According to the Office Web App team, when something changes, the server notifies all browsers currently logged in and editing the file there is a change and to update
 when they get a chance. For more detail, read this Office Web Apps article from the Office Blogs describing how Microsoft implemented real-time co-authoring:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://blogs.office.com/2013/11/19/real-time-co-authoring-in-the-excel-web-app-why-and-how-we-did-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.office.com/2013/11/19/real-time-co-authoring-in-the-excel-web-app-why-and-how-we-did-it/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The article is directed towards the Excel Web App, however you can apply the same concept to the Word, PowerPoint, and&nbsp;OneNote&nbsp;Web Apps as well. Since updates appear almost immediately, there is increased communication between the client and server devices,
 but less data is transferred&nbsp;to&nbsp;the browser; it'll only download what you can see on your screen. Real-time co-authoring requires some tweaks to the client-server model with some peer-to-peer characteristics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What activity can&nbsp;users expect&nbsp;from OneDrive?</p>
<p>Users should understand that your devices cannot directly communicate with each other via their own OneDrive apps; information and documents don't sync from your PC directly to&nbsp;your phone. All information must pass through&nbsp;OneDrive servers first, and then
 sync down to your other devices. Keep this concept in mind when troubleshooting your devices with OneDrive: if your other devices don't see content after updating files on one device, check OneDrive through your browser to see if the server has the most recent
 changes.</p>

            <p>This article was very helpful but something is not working for me. &nbsp;It states </p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For example, you update a Microsoft Word file on your computer and save it to the OneDrive folder on your computer. The OneDrive program immediately scans and records the new file and any other metadata
 to send to the OneDrive servers. It initiates a connection with OneDrive servers and requests to upload information on the server, finally uploading the content. OneDrive adds the new file to it's database and any device that syncs with OneDrive will download
 that new file."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">only I'm having issues with it not updating the files on my other computer. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Scenario is this - one laptop, one surface. &nbsp;I make new files on the laptop, it updates the one drive (via the internet) fine, and in my exploer files under onedrive on my laptop. But when I go
 and look on my one driver explorer files on my surface, they are not there. &nbsp;The surface is continually saying that it's syncing and searching for changes . Also any files i create in surface are not uploading to the one drive on the internet - i have to manually
 upload them. changes to files seem ok? though would have to chekc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any thoughts as to why, what I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>other info - laptop has window professional 7 and surface window 8.1. And it was working originally but not now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks.</p>

 into separate accounts at the same time? Also how is it possible, if I wasn't logged in at the time?&nbsp;

            Interesting but doesn't tell HOW to get files on different devices to upload to One Drive if they are not doing it now. I have access to Laptop Files on the One Drive on Laptop. And I have access to PC Files on One Drive on PC. But I do not have PC files
 when I go to One Drive on the Laptop or vice versa. What can I do to get ALL files on One Drive, regardless of the device I'm accessing One Drive?

            Isak, never Pay for Drivers - this is a SCAM !!
<br />
<br />Device Drivers are free, always were and always will be - do not fall for this scam
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your PC/Laptop?
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters section, what display device is listed there?

            Updates for your hardware are normally delivered through Windows Update or you download the drivers directly from the manufacturers website for your computer or device.

            Hi Asak, click the link below to get the latest official driver fro your  Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600 from the Official Intel website
<br />

<br />
<br />Please, never pay for drivers, you can always come here to MS Community and someone will guide you to the drivers you need . . .

    <title>M4V with subtitles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edy werder  say:</h3>
<h2>            M4V with subtitles</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded a movie and the subtitle file srt, converted it to a M4V file. My iPad plays it fine with subtitles. However my Surface Tablet with Video only plays the M4V and doesn't recognize the subtitles.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my options to play the movie with subtitles on my Surface?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Edy</p>

            <p>Hi Edy,</p>
<p><br />
I understand that you are unable to get subtitle in video app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps to add subtitles on video app:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open the Video app<br />
b. Right-click on the video you want to play<br />
c. Select Playback options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If closed caption is not available, you will see Not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any more query on issues related to video app on Windows and we would be happy to help you.</p>

<p>The movie has subtitles in M4V file. Would the Video app recognize a SRT file in the same folder?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a SRT file and the M4V movie in the same folder with the same name. The movie plays fine but the subtitle is not recognized from the native video app. It's not shown in the playback option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VLC has no problem with the SRT file at all. I would wish the native video app has this capability too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            cracked screen</h2>
                    <p>I have tried relentlessly to get my surface pro 3 cracked screen repaired. Everytime I try scheduling a repair i get the below message. Now there is no one for me to go to get my screen repaired. I even bought a new surface pro 4 but i am so regretting this
 decision, because the support on this device is ZERO. I am left aimless and clueless as to what to do, even though I am willing to pay for this repair. Shocked by this attitude</p>
<p>I bought the device from a valid surface pro 3 dealer licensed by Microsoft and inspite of that, I get this out of region policy.</p>

            <p>This means that if you bought your Surface in the USA but are requesting service from France and your shipping address is in France, you will get the French version (this is just an example) of the Surface as a replacement.</p>

            Hi Mama.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />Try connecting your PC through the network cable, and do not use Wifi and check if it captures the internet.
<br />If so, then check for Windows updates
<br />Settings&gt; Updates &amp; Security&gt; Windows Update
<br />Precede Check for Update
<br />
<br />You can also go to the Regedit and do the following

<h3> dalem2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network drive has red X after Windows 10 boot up</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Home version 1709 Build 16299.371 .&nbsp; I have a Netgear ReadyNas and is configure with user name and password.&nbsp; I do not have an AD controller or other domains.<br />
</p>
<p>I have a drive letter mapped on my Windows 10 from a share on my Netgear ReadyNas.&nbsp; This is a username/password protected share.&nbsp; Upon boot up the drive icon in File Explorer has a red X.&nbsp; Any program that is configured to use its drive letter report that
 it is not accessible.&nbsp; I have to double click on the drive icon in order for the red X to go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the following steps I have taken to trouble shoot the problem on my own.&nbsp; None of these have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Credential Manager I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the host name of my NAS for the "Internet or Network address:" field.</p>
<p>I have also tried using the ip address of my NAS for the ""Internet or Network address:" field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled my PIN login to Windows and I have enabled my pin login to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 'Turn Windows feature on or off' setting in Windows 10.&nbsp; Under SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support.&nbsp; I have checked SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and SMB 1.0/CIFS Client.&nbsp; I have also unchecked those setting as well.</p>
<p>I also reinstalled Windows 10 last weekend.&nbsp; I didn't do the "Refresh your install".&nbsp; Instead I wiped the drive and installed Windows 10 on the empty drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these have fixed the problem.&nbsp; A problem that I never had with Windows 7.&nbsp; This all started happening after the Fall update.&nbsp; I can't use unattended backup or sync software because the drive doesn't connect until I double click on it.&nbsp; I have included
 screen shots of the "turn windows feature on or off" and the "Credential Manager".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please fix it so it works again???</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do this, you can wait it out until the next version of Windows 10 1803, is released to see if it works better.  
<br />
<br />You could upgrade now to see how it works:

<p>I was letting some time pass while using 1803.&nbsp; My mapped drives are still not getting reattached at boot up.&nbsp; I believe it worked maybe 2 times in May and nothing so far this June.&nbsp; What is odd just like in the previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp; All I do
 is double click on the drive icon and it connects.&nbsp; I am never prompted for a password or given any errors.&nbsp; I just don't understand why it doesn't work on boot&nbsp; up.&nbsp; Especially when it use to work in previous versions.&nbsp; Installing a previous version will
 only work until that version is upgraded to the next version.&nbsp; Since you can't stop the upgrade.&nbsp; It is only a temporary solution.&nbsp; That is one of the unintended consequences of a rolling distribution or as Microsoft calls it software as a service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One would think this would be part of the sign-in process the OS does.&nbsp; Credentials are entered and verified.&nbsp; Those credentials are then used to authenticate other services.&nbsp; Something in that process is obviously broken.&nbsp; Since it is happening on different
 hardware.&nbsp; It all points to the software.</p>

<p>The only other issue I can think could cause it is the computers boot so fast now that the NIC doesn't connect before the mapped drives try to connect. I've tried slowing the boot down but to no avail.&nbsp; I have several users that probably aren't going to
 tolerate this issue well.&nbsp; We're using solid state drives so the systems boot even faster then spin drives.</p>

<p>I have been thinking the same thing.&nbsp; Something is the boot up sequence is either getting ahead of its self or behind.&nbsp; I am using a solid state drive as well.&nbsp; Been using one for at least 4 year or longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did notice that when the initial screen loads, the NIC has an X over it then about 5 secs later, it connects.</p>
<p>Going to research how to get that mapping to slow until the NIC connects.</p>

            I have noticed that on my computer.&nbsp; One thing I haven't tried yet is to make an old school batch file.&nbsp; You can put the net use commands in it and place it in the start up folder.&nbsp; I am thinking since it occurs later in the boot process it might work.

            I've been trying to get net use to work just as a command line function but having a connection issue. Wonder if there is a way to delay the map with command line.

    <title>What is a 64bits VDeck.exe&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitchellxp  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is a 64bits VDeck.exe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer crashed again after I experienced the "Unresponsive task bar buttons", you know the problem, the&nbsp; "Start button" was unresponsive&nbsp;, "Microsoft Edge button" disappeared, the "Store" button" also disappeared, and the "Action Center button" was
 unresponsive. As I went about trying to troubleshoot the problem, the situation worsened until the entire Task Bar became unresponsive and I could not sign-in to Windows. I sent the computer out to a local repair shop, and it was returned today. I have a new
 problem now The first page I see after Windows opens is a page full of "Apple", "Google", "Avast", and "Mozilla" advertising. Also appearing is an error note reading: "Your system is 64bits. Use a 64bits version of&nbsp;VDeck.exe". As a novice, I don't have the
 foggiest idea about what that error statement means. Can a 64bits VDeck.exe be downloaded or do I have to buy it from a store? If there are people out there with knowledge about this problem help or explain it to me. The computer is useless now after a very
 short period of time, the computer goes into the Power saving mode and remains in that mode for about 3 minutes when it restarts and the error message appears again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your timely response to my question, however, I never got a chance to download and install The VDeck.exe software because before I received your response, I attempted to Reset that computer. The Preparation, d Download, and Installation appeared
 to go smoothly for the Reset, except that Windows would not Open and I can't use that computer any more. I will post a new question to the community about my new problem and If I can get Windows to Open and&nbsp;then find that the VDeck.exe &nbsp;problem is still there;
 I will use the link that you provided. In the meantime I will mark your response as the answer to my VDeck.exe problem. If you have knowledge about how to get Windows to Open, I would certainly appreciate the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>I would love to comply with your request&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;a Screen Shot of the last screen seen while attempting to boot&nbsp;the machine. However, with my limited knowledge, I do not know how to get a Screen Shot of the pages before the Welcome Screen and without

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have given up on my ability to fix that computer. My plan is to take the computer to a local computer repair shop and let them&nbsp;attempt to install a bootable Operating System,&nbsp; or get the currently installed OS to successfully boot-up.</p>

                    <p>The IR programming tower installation fails with Cannot Copy Files.&nbsp; Attempts with compatibility checker all resulted in the same way.</p>
<p>The software is old (2004)&nbsp;but instructions on how to use it up to Win 7 are on line so it would appear to be Win 8 specific.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Paul</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm, are you trying to install the USB driver on Windows 8? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Software is not compatible with Windows 8 operating system, I suggest you to install the application in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode.
</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Type <b>compatibility</b> in the search box and then press
<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Click “<b>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b>” option from the list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Select the .exe file and Click on Open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>For Reference:</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong></span></p>

    <title>Possibility to move windows to other monitors with &#39;windows key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merten willy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possibility to move windows to other monitors with &#39;windows key &#43; shift &#43; arrow keys&#39; on fullscreen youtube with windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(221, 221, 221, 1)">I've noticed that moving windows between monitors with 'win key + shift + left/right arrows' does work with all kinds of windows but it behaves weird on fullscreen youtube videos. I currently have 3 monitors
 connected and what 'win key + shift + leftarrow' does is move the fullscreen video to the right monitor and 'win key + shift + rightarrow' moves it over to the left monitor. Notice that left and right are reversed, and that the primary middle monitor can't
 be reached with the shortcuts. This behaviour happens both in chrome and firefox. On microsoft edge, the fullscreen youtube video doesn't seem to move at all. I'm not sure if this matters but i'm using an Nvidia 960m graphics card with the latest driver. I
 have windows 10 updated to the latest version.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest that you disable the Security software and then try to start the service and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>You may also have to start the dependency services and check if that helps.</p>
<p>To view service dependencies check the link provided below.</p>

            <p>If you purchased an OEM version you need to return it / exchange it for the 32Bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of processor do you have, as it may support 64Bit versions of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download, burn an installation DVD and try each version (32Bit / 64Bit) of Windows 7 for 30 days without the need to activate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 32Bit: <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58996.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58997.iso</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading the correct .iso file use ImgBurn or Gear ISO to create a bootable DVD.</p>

<p><br />
ImgBurn - In addition to supporting the creation of Cds/DVDs from .ISO files, <br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free. <br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />

(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p><br />
====================== <strong>Keyless Install</strong> ================================</p>
<p>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to:<br />
'Type your Windows product key',&nbsp; do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark<br />
to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to&nbsp;verify that the 64Bit version of&nbsp;Windows is supported.

<p>Dont know, sorry. &nbsp; I might run the typical fix most things scans from&nbsp; command prompt(admin);</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might also boot up windows without the battery installed for 10 minutes or so before replacing back the battery.</p>

</p><p>My Lenovo has a Microsoft store app 'Lenovo Vantage'&nbsp; that has battery settings, and some other hardware settings in it.&nbsp; Perhaps your computer has some general manufacturers program it is missing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Stretched or zoomed in&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmenzul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stretched or zoomed in&#63;</h2>
                    I turned my computer on and everything on my desktop is stretched.&nbsp; Icons are on "classic", but are still too big.<br />
<br />
The picture on my desktop is stretched, where before it was positioned so that it was not stretched, and there was some black around the edges.&nbsp; Now I have to choose the "stretched" option because if I choose how I had it before, or "grid", it just zooms in
 to a small part of the picture.<br />
<br />
So my question is, what is wrong with my computer, and can somebody help me without me having to pay $59?

            Hi Brian,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Windows may not recognize the network adapter that looks like it has a problem therefore when you scanned for hardware changes that's probably why nothing happened.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Mark is right in that it sounds like there was an issue with your display adapter driver that caused the resolution to drop down to a lower resolution, which would make your Desktop wallpaper appear differently and your icons seem bigger.&nbsp; It could also just
 be that your resolution has changed.&nbsp; To change the resolution, follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Right-click on your desktop and select <strong>Personalize<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Click <strong>Display Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
There should be a slider underneath Resolution:&nbsp; Move this to the right and click apply.&nbsp; You can move it over until you find a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolution that you like but you will need to click apply for the setting to take affect.&nbsp; Click OK once you have the desired
 screen size<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you mean by your desktop is black?&nbsp; Is it just that the Wallpaper (picture) that was there before is gone?&nbsp; If so, that was probably just a carry over from the original problem.&nbsp; Have you recently updated your display adapter driver, or possibly installed
 Windows Updates that may have updated the driver?&nbsp; If you have, you may want to try rolling back the driver.&nbsp; I have provided steps below for rolling back the driver and also for updating the driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><b><span>To roll back your video driver:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>*Note:</span></b><span> To complete the following steps you must have
<b>Control Panel Home</b> selected within <b>Control Panel</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then click

<b>Continue</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Expand <b>Display adapters</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right-click your adapter, and click

<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Select the <b>Driver</b> tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click the <b>Roll Back Driver</b> button (It will be grayed out if the driver was not recently updated.&nbsp; If it is grayed out, continue to the
<b>update your video driver</b> instructions below) </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; <b>

</span></span><span>Select the <b>Driver</b> tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Permissions problem after upgrade to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart4042  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permissions problem after upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hope someone can shed some light on my problem. I recently upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7. I am the only user on the computer and I am an administrator. After upgrade I now find that whenever I open a programme I get a prompt "Do you want to allow this app
 to make changes to your computer?". That is not such a problem however if I open a file that causes the said programme to open, I do not get the same prompt which later causes problems updateing or saving the file to different folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to copy a file to a subfolder I get "Destination Folder Access Denied" message. I then need to assert "adminstrator permissions" to continue.&nbsp; Although I am logged in as andministrator I am repeatedly being blocked from subfolders in my documents
 folder. I have checked my permissions on sub folders and they are the same as the parent user folder, giving me full controll, so why it keeps asking this I really do not know.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other permissions related problem affects me when downloading files to my computer. I can downlad to the top user folder, but if I try to download to sub folders I get blocked. Aparantly I need to have administrator permissions, even though I am logged
 in as an administrator. In the end I have to download to user, then manually move the folder to the target folder. This of course elicits the "Destination Folder Access Denied" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and rechecked my permissions, on all problem folders but cannot see what I am doing wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

    <title>Subscription Skype number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> st&#229;leengan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subscription Skype number</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a Skype number, the subscription for the number should have been paid December 31. 2017.<br />
<br />
Payment was declined since I have received a new VISA card and the old one has been deleted. I added a new VISA card a few days ago, but the order has not been paid. Of course I changed the payment method to the new card.<br />
<br />
So I've now transferred money so there's enough Skype credit to pay the order, but the order is still unpaid. Of course, I changed my payment method to Skype Credit.<br />
<br />
I want to keep the number, but Skype will not have my money.<br />
<br />
How can I convince Skype to take my money?

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I believe it would be <br />
<br />
devcon disable "HID-compliant*"<br />
<br />
If that's not working for you either, please let me know what other command lines you've already tried.<br />
<br />
In your example, will you always know the HWID for the device that you want to disable?&nbsp; Or will it be different?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mark

devcon path on my computer is C:\Documents and Settings\libio\Desktop\devcon.exe, so I run on cmd: C:\Documents and Settings\libio\Desktop\devcon.exe disable "HID-compliant device".&nbsp;&nbsp;And I get: No devices disabled<br />

            Looking at the docs for the tool, it looks like you can only use the Hardware ID or the instance ID.<br />
<br />
Will the HWID always be consistent in your case?

    <title>Saints Row IV Season Pass Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cehdirkpitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saints Row IV  Season Pass Installation</h2>
                    
<p>How do I install the Season Pass so I can play the Dominatrix DLC?&nbsp; When I check the Downloadable Content section from within the game, the Season Pass shows as Purchased, the weapon is installed, but the Dominatrix mission says it will not be accessible
 until the Season Pass is installed, and I can't find a way to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I cleared the cache, deleted and re-downloaded all the files with no luck.&nbsp; If I choose Play Now from the Live d/l menu, it say it's only accessible from within the game.&nbsp; Do I have to finish the main game first, or do I have a dad d/l?&nbsp; Thanks for any
 help.</p>

<p>No luck with that - Both the Season Pass and Dominatrix show in D/L history. both as if I was to d/l again.
</p>
<p>I wonder if I messed something up - I purchased and D/L dominatrix first before I realized it was part of Season Pass when I purchased it.</p>

<p>I've noticed with some games that have title updates stored in the same place as the saved games, they sometimes don't see the dlc installed. &nbsp;So if Saints Row IV has a title update stored with the saved games, then delete the title update and the dlc, then
 redownload the DLC, and then start the game, let the game update, and hopefully your game will recognise the season pass and your dlc.</p>

            <p>For those who couldn't update....you're very fortunate! My computer just updated to Windows 8.1 WITHOUT permission. I DID NOT WANT IT, which is why I kept refusing installation permission. But the other day, it happened anyway, when I started up my laptop.
 &nbsp;Now,&nbsp;web pages&nbsp;keep crashing, which didn't happen with Windows 8 (don't get me wrong, I hated that one as well- but at least it didn't turn my computer into a worthless brick). Thanks Microsoft!

 there are a lot of people having the same issue - TROUBLESHOOTING DOES NOT FIX THIS!!

            None of these remedies have anything to do with the problem. &nbsp;The mic shows a line thru it and no audio comes thru the headphones at all. &nbsp;New headohones and controller and still have the same issue. &nbsp;Most my friends are havjng the same problem.

<p>Hey there Lucid!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue. </p>
<p>I would say that if none of the previously posted issues have helped resolve your issue, I'd try what we call a soft reset of the console.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Also
 make sure that you select the option denoted <strong>reset and keep my games and apps.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Follow
 the steps here on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a> see if that helps. </span>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
If
 it doesn't resolve that though, you might need your console to be serviced, which you can get done by going to our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support </a>portal or by getting in contact with <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>and speaking to an agent directly. </p>
