<h2>            I entered safe mode networking and then when I restarted my PC automatic repair was there and now it&#39;s in an endless loop. Pls help</h2>
                    I entered safe mode networking and then when I restarted my PC automatic repair was there and now it's in an endless loop. Automatic repair only started after I booted my pc to safe mode (networking). I've tried every method and non of them worked and
 I suspect it's because of Safe Mode still being turned on so no matter how many times I do those steps, if I restart my PC it would still lead me to automatic repair which I think is because of safe mode being turned on. Is there anyway to fix this or maybe
 disable safe mode in command prompt? Please help

            Hi Randomguy0205
<br />
<br />If Safe Mode is causing this:
<br />
<br />Go to Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Copy this command into the command Window and hit enter:
<br />
<br />bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

            Hi RG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What did you do exactly in Safe mode?  How did you enter it and leave it?  
<br />
<br />If you updated drivers that were problematic then this could be the problem.  You should go back into Safe Mode to undo what you did, of update driver to one you know which works, then see if Windows will Start Normally.  
<br />
<br />Safe Mode doesn't cause problems, it's only a refuge if Windows cannot start - normally because of drivers, which is why Safe Mode works since it doesn't load them all - so if you did something in Safe Mode and now Windows cannot start, try first to undo it in Safe Mode, then if not try accessing Repair Mode to do a System Restore to before the changes were made:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If accessing Safe Mode or doing a System Restore won't any longer work then do a Reset saving files.  
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or even do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Randomguy0205
<br />
<br />When that repair loop fails, you then get the opportunity to go to advanced Options, have you tried Restore Points to see if you have a Restore Point to revert your system to?
<br />
<br />Also boot into Safe Mode:
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            All I did was enable safe mode, choose networking, hit apply and ok, restart it then after I restarted it, the automatic repair started and it always says it couldn't repair my pc. It never stopped. Ever since that I've never had access to my pc. I'm just
 stuck here.

            Again, use whichever method works here to access Advanced Startup Options:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>

<br />Try Startup Repair, System Restore, the Command Prompt to run the command Dave gave you, then if nothing else works do the Reset.

<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:

<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.

            <p>I have seen corruption all over the place with Windows 10 and I have recommended people not to upgrade to it for this reason. I have seen this happen on my PC (now three times) and my laptop once. Both machines have multiple profiles and sometimes I see
 it one only one profile. The best solution I've seen, which I consider a POOR SOLUTION, is reimage the machine and restore software previously&nbsp;installed from backup. I've done this and it works but it takes me
<em>FOREVER </em>to get my software and applications re-installed again.</p>

    <title>Getting support from Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scjohn2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting support from Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>The "virtual agent" doesn't work (needs some serious AI reprogramming--maybe bring back Bill Gates from the Foundation?) at answering questions sensibly and the options to talk to a person are nonfunctional. If you call Microsoft support (have to dig to
 find the number) they ask you are home or business. If you say home, they ask you twice if you want paid help and promise to provide free-help resource info. When you say no the second time, the robot responder says thanks for calling Microsoft and then hangs
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Microsoft for decades and just bought two new computers with Windows 10 and Office 365. I am tempted to take the loss and buy Apple at this point if this is the kind of customer support to expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, here's the problem. When I shut down the computer, I see a message saying one app is preventing shutdown. Of course the little icon shows a generic app and offers no clue what application it is. I can wait until the cows come home but Windows
 never shuts down the app (assuming there is one running) so I just say shut down anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's impossible to shut down "the application" because there is none running--at least Task Manager doesn't think so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My antivirus software doesn't find any malware running either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clues, anyone, on getting help from an indifferent Microsoft or on solving the questionable shutdown issue?</p>

            Usually when you close out all programs, some might still be resident in memory while shutting down. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Under the Processes look at which programs still might be running then end them.
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Your web browser can be notorious for keeping itself in memory even after exiting. So, make sure that is closed.

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can ask for help here from volunteer experts, as you will not find those in any MS Support venues except their physical stores where they hire techs to compete with Apple Genius bar.  
<br />
<br />Establish a Clean Boot from Step 4 in this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />This will prevent any freeloaders from running the background and also stalling shutdown.
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough you can more aggressively get rid of that error here:  
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/windows-tip-disable-this-app-is-preventing-shutdown-or-restart-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/windows-tip-disable-this-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have other performance problems you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Games with Gold - Saints Row 4 -No Download Button&#47;Tile &#38;quot&#59;Fix&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p><br />
I had an issue with downloading the free Saints Row 4 through Games with Gold and thought it would be nice to share how I solved this (with the help of online support).</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>1. Accessing Games with Gold via the x360 main screen and selecting Saints Row 4 presented a screen without a download option (so couldn't download via this channel).</p>
<p>2. Logging into xbox live via web and selecting Saints Row 4 from Games with Gold download resulted in an error message of "game not available in your region"</p>
<p>Resolution:</p>
<p>Search for Saints Row 4 from Games menu on x360.&nbsp; There are two hits that look like the game box.&nbsp; One gives you the download option with gold.&nbsp; The other doesn't and appears to be the same as the one linked to the Games with Gold shortcut on the main screen.&nbsp;
 I selected the the one that had the download button and it is currently downloading (so should work).</p>
<p>I also suggested (to support) to update the shortcut on games with gold from the main x360 screen from the one without the download button/tile to the one with.</p>
<p>HTH others who have the same issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've the same issue with an Acer Switch 10. Depending on the application launched (explicitely by clicking it or implicitely through the file type association), I get an error 2143326205 or the application does not open and gives notification. I've tried
 the proposed solution and have done a reset of Win10 but problem remains.</p>
<p>I've found in the system log that an error 307 in DCOM is generated each time. The error 2143326205 is not the root cause but a consequence of the DCOM error.</p>
<p>Here is the text of the error. Can you examine and find a solution : </p>

            <p>If you're having trouble purchasing Xbox 360 content on Xbox One, it could be due to a few reasons. There's more info on the page here: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/payment-and-purchases/troubleshoot-xbox%20360-marketplace-purchasing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../troubleshoot-xbox%20360-marketplace-purchasing</a> but generally this happens because either the account is a child account or because the account doesn't have a payment option on file, which would be required for that (even if the payment option isn't charged, as is the case with Games with Gold titles). </p>

<h2>            Any way to recover deleted screenshots folder&#63; also deleted from recycle bin&#63;</h2>
                    I deleted my screenshots folder, also emptied the recycle bin. Now all new screenshots are getting saved to the newly created screenshots folder. Can I recover my old screenshots folder? I used recuva and searched this new screenshots folder, but no use.
 I also scanned recycle bin using recuva and still no use. Also scanned the entire pictures folder and still did not get anything. So any ideas?

yes I did the deep scan. In pictures folder, only the items deleted from that folder&nbsp;are seen and items in its subfolders are not seen. So from the screenshots folder are not seen.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 &#40;i5 256Gb&#41; Does not turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michiel cornille  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 &#40;i5 256Gb&#41; Does not turn on</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Reinstalled my Surface Pro 3 yesterday using the recovery images as i wanted a clean install after testing the insider ring.</p>
<p>Everything worked great no issues until this morning after i installed all my apps. ( office, Visual Studio,... no exotic programs :) )</p>
<p>Installed and testen without any problems then i left it to sync my onedrive and ... when i got back the device had a black screen ( No backlight ) No keyboard light and i wouldn't turn on anymore.</p>
<p>The device was plugged in and white light on the plug was on (not blinking) and keyboard attached. i tried force shutdown, force shutdown with volume up...
</p>
<p>What i do notice is when i push the power butten after about 1-2 seconds the white light on the powerplug blinks once and stays on again but screen stays black. Device is out of warranty so before i pay to ship it as there are no Microsoft stores here i
 want te test every possible thing so any advice is welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>SOLVED (For now):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it for +/- 4 hours with power and keyboard connected. When i returned i pressed the power butten i noticed the white light of the power flashed more then once so i started counting and the first count was 5 times, next it was 9 and by my suprise the
 surface started to boot up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment i have no idea what happend. There are no errors in the eventlog, last event was from 19/09/17 08:13:26 - The speed of processor 3 in group 0 is being limited by system firmware. The processor has been in this reduced performance state for
 71 seconds since the last report.</p>
<p>after that nothing until 19/09/17 18:38:32 - The system time has changed to ‎2017‎-‎09‎-‎19T16:38:32.829000000Z from ‎2017‎-‎09‎-‎19T06:13:27.271143000Z. Change Reason: An application or system component changed the time.<br />
</p>
<p>Just to be sure i disabled the automatic sleep and in the power options removed sleep from shutdown menu. Hope don't have this again</p>

<p>Hi Michiel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us. Good to hear that the issue is now resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case that you have other inquiries, feel free to post back here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the problem is back even with the sleep disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i have another possible reason that this happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i shutdown my surface the screen goes black but the backlight on the keyboard is still on for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>Normally i wait for the backlight to go out before closing the lit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last time i shutdown my laptop i was in a hurry so didn't have time to wait and now the pc doesn't respond to the power button.<br />
</p>
<p>Will try the same like last time leave it plugged in and keyboard connected and power connected for 4 hours and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: There is something reacting to the press of the power button as i see the light on the power adapter blink once.</p>
<p>but the screen stays black and keyboard backlight stays off.</p>

            SOLVED: My device turns on again. The time on the device is frozen to 16:54 15/11/2017 this is when i shutdown the device

    <title>How does everyone fell about encounters with minors on age restricted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How does everyone fell about encounters with minors on age restricted games, and how should it be dealt with as an xbox ambassador &#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I encounter under age children on age restricted games I personally block that account regardless if it my have an adult user. I have heard to many horror storys about adult men talking under age teenage girls( thinking they are speaking/gaming with
 someoone age appropriate)and exchanging social media accounts only to find themselves in hot water. I personally know a fellow gamer this happened to.<br />

            Personally I don't chat in public lobbies. But it comes down to the parents of those minors. It's their responsibility to watch their children and what they do online. I don't exchange information with anyone without knowing for sure who they are, if at
 all.&nbsp;

<p>The online part of any game doesn't have a age rating.Every game with online tells you this,which is why anything you do on xbox live must be rated E for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As mentioned,at the end of the day it's entirely down to the parents if their kids are playing games where the single player part is age restricted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A lot of parents are clueless as to what little Timmy is playing or online gaming as long as it keeps them quiet &amp; out of the way.</p>

            Nothing you can do about someone that is "underage" playing a game.&nbsp; That is up to their parents/custodians.&nbsp; If you act appropriately towards them as you would to anyone there is no "hot water" to get into.

            As I rarely talk in public gaming sessions it's unlikely to be an issue for me, while I might disagree with minors playing adult rated games it's not for me to judge.&nbsp; Regarding the horror stories, all we can do is continue to educate &amp; inform regarding
 parental control settings, as someone who's used to dealing with those situations professionally I'm comfortable enough to ensure that nothing I say in those situations can be misconstrued.

<p>There isn't much you can do about encountering minors online. The best thing to do is to avoid sharing personal information with them, or anyone online. You can't be in hot water if you maintain appropriate behavior. I'd personally suggest muting, or avoid
 chatting with underage people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dividing my drive to have both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    My drive has 433 gb and only 39 gb is being used.At the moment I am running W7 Pro and wonder if I could split the drive and have both W7 and W10 running and if so could you please guide me in simple terms.

            <p>How to dual boot Windows 7 and Windows 10&nbsp;(The article is based on the Technical Preview version but the concept is the same for the released version of Windows: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pagestart.com/win7win10tpdb10121401.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.pagestart.com/win7win10tpdb10121401.html</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that the free upgrae requires a prior version of Windows is installed so unless you have another version installed and are dule booting you will need to purchase Windows 10 unless you are a Windows Insider.</p>

<p>In Windows 7 and&nbsp;later versions of Windows, partitioning is&nbsp;easier to do than Windows XP. Regardless of this, you might encounter problems when using Windows 7’s disk management to create it. If you do experience this, refer to the previous instructions
 about&nbsp;using EaseUs to create the partition instead. Anyway, here is how you create a partition in Windows 7 or later:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-1_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d361%26amp%3bh%3d187" height="187" width="361" /></a></p>
<p>Open a Run command (Press Windows key + R) on your keyboard. Then type <strong>
diskmgmt.msc then hit Enter on your keyboard.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click Start, right click Computer &gt; click Manage &gt; click Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 users:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32972cb4-0d83-4a20-848b-ffabeab917a7" /></p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard and click <strong>Disk Management. </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-2_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d374%26amp%3bh%3d298" height="298" width="374" /></a></p>
<p>Once Disk Management is open, select the C:\ or where your current version of&nbsp;Windows is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-31.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-3_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d371%26amp%3bh%3d285" height="285" width="371" /></a></p>
<p>Right click it and click Shrink menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-41.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-4_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d363%26amp%3bh%3d98" height="98" width="363" /></a></p>
<p><em>Wait while Windows checks for available disk space.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-51.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-5_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d372%26amp%3bh%3d252" height="252" width="372" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the amount you want to allocate. Depending on the architecture of Windows&nbsp;10 you want to try. If you are using Windows&nbsp;10 32 bit, you can allocate 16 GBs or 20 GBs if you using the 64 bit version. Another factor is disk space for applications, page
 file, drivers, accumulation data over time. So make sure you make consideration for these factors. My personal recommendation is to go with a minimum 60 to 100 GBs of space for Windows 10 testing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-61.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-6_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d379%26amp%3bh%3d302" height="302" width="379" /></a></p>
<p>The Disk Management window should display unallocated disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong>Dynamic Volume Error Message</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)"><em>"Windows cannot be installed to this hard disk space. This partition contains one or more dynamic volumes that are not supported for installation"</em></span></p>
<p>Becareful what you are doing. I encountered this error last year when I was setting up partitions in anticipation of the Windows 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both shrinking an existing partition and using a third party partitioning tool. I gave it a try and it made the system not able to boot. Luckily, I had a system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is with the partitioning scheme of the drive. If you are using a computer where the manufacturer has several partitions, example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C: Local Disk</p>
<p>E: Recovery</p>
<p>F: Tools</p>
<p>H: System </p>
<p>G: Other partition</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these partitions will need to be sacrificed in order to facilitate shrinking Local Disk C:\ where Windows is installed&nbsp;to create a logical volume with enough disk space to accomodate Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you do not sacrifice System, Local Disk (C:\)&nbsp;and Recovery, you should be able to shrink Drive C: and create enough space to dual boot. Here is an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14b9dd53-813e-4cd9-84eb-0b076aa669ff" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Above I have a partition layout showing 5 separate partitions (why the manufacturer HP did this? I don't know). One of these partitions turned out to be unnecessary, in this case the Tools partition which turns out to be blank. As long as you do not disturb&nbsp;the
 system partition, Local disk and recovery partitions, everything should be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the Tools partition and click <strong>Delete Volume, </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: This might be different on your system make sure you observe carefully what you are doing.</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>The volume will now appear as Unallocated. Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the partition&nbsp;to left of&nbsp;it.. Right click the volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual menu, click ‘Yes’ when the warning appears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>You can then go ahead and shrink C:\ Local disk to create enough space for your Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do strongly recommend you create a system image in advance of doing this:</p>

            Thank you for your reply but it would appear that there is too much risk of errors appearing for which I would have insufficient knowledge to handle so have decided to just stay with W7.

                    <p>I'm running Windows Live Mail 2011, Build 15.4.3555.0308.&nbsp; This version has several operating issues that have been discussed on various Microsoft Forums, but so far not addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do see reference to a 2012 version of Windows Live and wonder if it has an updated WLM component?</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t a brand-new PC laptop connect to my Apple network&#63;</h2>
                    I have an Apple network with a Apple Extreme router. I have two Apple notebooks that connect to the wifi without a problem. But a new PC laptop with Vista cannot connect. My suspicion is that Windows is somehow blocking or interfering with the connection,
 since the Mac router is set up properly. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Follow this process to make sure that you laptop's Wireless works as it should.</p>
<p>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>

    <title>Rename Windows 10 system folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xdpsx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rename Windows 10 system folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
All the folders less ShellExperienceHost in the following 4 folders, has been renamed.<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\SystemApps<br />
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps​<br />
C:\Windows\InfusedApps\<br />
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Packages<br />
<br />
It has gone a few days, and still everything is working normal, at least from what I can see<br />
<br />
Can anyone please answer to the next 3 questions?<br />
<br />
1.If is not already happening in the background, what it will happen or what it could happen sooner or later regarding the properly functioning of OS, services, system applications(I don't think I use any) or other used third party applications?<br />
<br />
2. If it will not happen something for sure sooner or later, can someone please tell where are the biggest chances to something not work like it should?<br />
<br />
- SECURITY of the OS + it's applications, other services, and third party programs.<br />
- STABILITY(proper functionality) of the OS + it's applications, other services, and third party programs.<br />
- SLOWING DOWN the System and the applications.<br />
<br />
3. If you consider that something wrong will happen for sure, is there the option to prevent it without renaming only the OS dependencies folder? Or the only chance to prevent something bad which will happen 100% for sure, is to let all the names of the folders
 default, like they were before?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>Renaming/deleting Windows system folders is not a good idea unless you are fully familiar with the architecture of the operating system. It is also not cost-effective: The cost of hard disks is minuscule when compare to the cost of a competent system administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to your questions: I think you will have to do your own research.</p>

            I'm also having this problem, but a different skype account with the same settings on my computer (and hence on the same network) shows people with the statuses they actually set (eg away, busy, etc). Even after I've uninstalled and re-installed, the primary
 account I use still shows everyone as offline all the time, and my other account still shows contacts with the status as they are set. It seems to be some kind of account setting issue, I just can't find what it is - when i went through all my settings for
 the account with the contacts offline issue, they're the same as the same as the other one. Some help is appreciated.

<p>Yes. The issue is on the server side:</p>

</p><p>First of all, this is a Skype server account issue. Meaning, someone accounts will have these issues and some will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new free Microsoft 365 account - I used the same email address as my skype account - and it asked me if I want to MERGE my Skype account to my Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I merged the accounts, logged in using my office 365 email address, I was able to see my contacts and send/receive all messages again. It seems this issue doesn't occur for newer accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi KingHarlem,</p>
<p>Have you looked at your Halo 4 save files, wherever they are stored, and noted if they possibly have the "corrupted" icon?</p>
<p>There are at least two files in Halo 4 that are related to your gamertag, one is named "Halo 4 Save Data" and the other is a file with your gamertag as the name (for me, it's named RedSVO). A yellow triangle with an exclamation point inside it means it is
 corrupted or incomplete. No icon, good.</p>
<p>If all is good, have you tried to copy your Halo 4 save files to another device, such as a USB flash drive or the cloud? Actually, I'd "MOVE" them to that device and then restart the game from the dashboard and see if the result is the same. When Halo 4
 starts, it will prompt you for the location of these files, select the new location. If you get the same result, you can rule out the save files. Please post your results here.
</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Again,</p>
<p>You can also try this:</p>
<p>1. MOVE all of the Halo 4 files from the device you currently have them stored on to another as described in my previous post.</p>
<p>2. Clear your system cache (never hurts when you have issues as you have described). Here is a link to the page that describes the process:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>3. Restart Halo 4 from the dashboard.</p>
<p>4. When Halo 4 starts and you are prompted to select the device where your save files are located, DO NOT select the device you moved them to. Rather, select another device that contains no halo 4 save files (as if you were starting the game for the first
 time).</p>
<p>5. Attempt to play the game as described in your original post. Do the same issues occur?</p>
<p>At least you will have a copy of your oiriginal save files, so you don't lose your progress. However, if all is well without them, it does raise the question about their integrity.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, or at least gets you on your way to a solution. Cheers!</p>
