    <title>cannot copy files to&#47;from usb drive in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot copy files to&#47;from usb drive in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Until just a few days ago my Windows7 professional Dell laptop could access USB flash drives without problem. It suddenly refused to open/copy/save any file, either saying I need administrator access (which I have) or just reporting that access is denied.
 I have poured over all the other posted questions related to this issue that I could and have found no solutions that work.</p>
<p>Before anyone posts it - I have seen the solution that calls for clicking right-clicking on the drive, selecting properties and then the security tab. No flash drive that I have put into any usb port has such a tab when properties is selected (the internal
 hard drive and my external backup drive - which is a USB drive but is connected through a docking port - DO have the security tab).</p>
<p>I have tried sharing the drives, not sharing the drives, enabling "Everyone" permissions on files/folders, etc. to no avail.</p>
<p>The files are all accessible on any machine NOT running Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of frustration over this issue but not any universal solutions. Let's just say I'm not thrilled with Windows7.</p>

            I do not have the faintest idea why you should have this problem but here is what I would do in such a case. I know that you have already taken some of these steps:<br />
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Perform a System Restore to set Windows back by a week.</li><li>Check if the problem occurs just with one USB mass storage device or with all of them.</li><li>Check if the problem occurs on all USB port or just one.</li><li>Check if the problem persists when booting into Safe Mode.</li><li>Keep tapping F8 at boot time, then boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode and check if the problem persists.</li><li>Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode, then check again.</li><li>Burn an Ubuntu boot CD (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/) and check again.<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<div>The results should give you some clear pointers to what might cause your problem.</div>

<h2>            No Administrator Rights On The PC &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    For some reason I am not able to access or install anything that requires an admin, and also I cannot add an admin account. I am signed in with a local account but it is a guest account and even when I sign in with my Microsoft account the account type
 does not change (still stays as a guest account) and I cannot access the command prompt(admin), manage user accounts or install apps from the web which say 'allow this app to make changes to your pc.' I am unable to press the 'yes' button as it is 'unclickable'
 in a matter of speaking. Please help. Thank you.

</p><p>As I understand his problem, he has only one userid on his system. I do not know if that userid ever had ADMIN, rights? Did it Foiza, do you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then how did that ever happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did, then what could have changed that?</p>

            <p>10hj I agree with you. Windows has problems and it looks like the only way to fix it is to spend at least 3 days reinstalling everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks WillianTurley, but I can't run anything as an administrator. I am denied and blocked every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying many different suggestions from different posts. This last one of "sfc /scannow" is a new one and it still does not work. I don't have administrative rights to run any of this suggestions. I cannot run anything as an administrator as an error
 box comes up denying me from running most all programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to Windows 10 several months ago and everything was working, up to the last 3 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing Works. I have tried to do everything this post said and 24 others in other posts. The problem remains as lost of Administrative rights. When I want to do anything the usual response of Windows 10 is that I do not have administrative rights.
 Even asking for the "command prompt (Admin)" I don't have the rights. I have used Microsoft's malicious software program for a year and yet now I don't have user rights to run it as with many other programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one user and it was the administrator. From another post I created another Administrator, but when I log in I still don't have user rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored my system back to a restore point 2 months ago and for 3 days everything worked. Now I am back to no user rights and doing the restore point again does not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even followed one post saying to use regedit - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - load Hive - tried to rename the SAM file to REM_SAM like the post said, but, you guessed it, I don't have the administrative rights to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there are hundreds of people who have this problem and sometimes some post helps, but most of the time nothing helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS THERE SOMEONE WHO CAN FIX THIS LOST OF ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHTS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think most people just give up and reinstall their Windows 10. I can't do that, because I installed Windows 10 over the Internet and paid for it. But, I don't have a disk to reinstall Windows and I would guess it would take at least 3 days to
 get back to where I am now without a guarantee this won't happen again. I have been a Windows user since the Windows 2. Windows has come a long way, but problems just get harder and harder to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION OTHER THAN A COMPLETE REINSTALL?</p>

            <p>I created a local account and changed the administrator rights to it but I've lost administration for both accounts.&nbsp;The media creation tool option cant work either as it also requires administrator rights for execution. Using the command prompt is also
 out of control even in the safe mode...shows "access denied"</p>
<p>Do&nbsp;I have to make a clean reinstall of the OS ?</p>

            yes, have been through a lot of this. I even tried going back to the version of windows 10 before the update, stayed with that for awhile until it decided it had to update again. Same problem again.&nbsp; I ended up going back to my windows 8.1 as i got annoyed
 with this happening.&nbsp; I would have preferred to stay with windows 10 as i liked that better.&nbsp; Nobody seemed to be able to help me fix the problem.&nbsp; got told to go to safe mode to see if it was mouse or something else, but I was not even sure on what to look
 for as i was told nothing, just to go to safe mode.&nbsp; If it helped, the mouse worked perfect in safe mode, other than that, well, not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows XP Restart hangs - Fails to complete shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>Windows&nbsp;XP desktop hangs during a restart.&nbsp; The machine logs off the user account and displays "shutting down" but&nbsp;never finishes the shutdown.&nbsp; The problems only happens during a restart ("shutdown" and "log off" functions work fine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just reinstalled to operating system (no other software installed). &nbsp;&nbsp;The system startups fine, no errors/events logged.</p>
<p>How can I diagnose the situation?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks Emikoz... resetting the date works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Close Microsoft Solitaire Collection</p>
<p>- Open a Command Prompt window (Click '<em><strong>Start</strong></em>', type:&nbsp;<strong> cmd</strong>)</p>
<p>- In the Command Prompt window, type:&nbsp; <strong>date</strong></p>
<p>- Then enter the last day of the month you want... <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...for example, for September 2017, enter:&nbsp; 09-30-17</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (If you want, you could just type:&nbsp; date 09-30-17&nbsp; ...all on one line.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Now start Microsoft Solitaire Collection... and go to Daily Challenges to finish up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, you can type the command 'date' again with the current date to reset your date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer automatically resets the date while you're playing a game, the results will be saved anyway when you complete the individual game, but you may have to close MS Sol Collection and set the date again to go back for any other unfinished games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are in the Daily Challenges window... at the bottom, next to the progress bar is an Awards button. Click it and you're shown your monthly progress.</p>

<p>Hi Emikoz</p>
<p>My problem is with Microsoft Mahjong where I have missed by 1 day September 17 and I keep getting required privilege is not held by client when using the cmd solution. Also my date is shown as 15-09-17 and not 15/09/17. it is really bugging me that for one
 missed day I lose the whole year.</p>
<p>Thanks Peter</p>

    <title>No thunderbolt on the Surface Pro 3&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No thunderbolt on the Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    It seem that the Surface Pro&nbsp;3 is out with no thunderbolt connection. This is troubling mostly because of its compatibility (Anything mini-display works on Thunerbolt but not vice-versa) but more specifically because it seemed that they were trying to
 reach musicians in the early stages of the original release (Surface Pro I). Whats hot in the music scene now is thunderbolt. Anyone have an Idea why, other than cost reasons, did they go with this decision? Otherwise I hope this reaches Microsoft and let
 them know that it would be great to use a surface with ones traveling set up. Am I the only one that wants thunderbolt connectivity?&nbsp;

<p>Actually Thunderbolt belongs to Intel.&nbsp; Apple just has to have the newest and greatest to charge more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chipset in the SP3 is Tbolt capable and during the Reddit AMA it was asked about and an extremely vague answer was to check the power ( i think it was) connector slot.&nbsp; So there were rumors that the port might be Tbolt capable....</p>

<p>James - Lenovo and Acer have had Thunderbolt equipped laptops since 2012, it is owned by Intel, Apple helped develop it and gets a free or reduced license fee. Intel charges the other OEMs to use it, much like USB 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0 (all owned by Intel as
 well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All we know about the Data Bus in the Power Connector is that it is there and used by the Dock and MS has conformed it is not Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were a betting man I would say it a USB 3.0/DisplyPort Pass Through for the dock.</p>

            <p>Well, that sounds good. &nbsp;I have not checked recently on the connector; usually when they come out, 5 years later they become industry wide available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Thunderbold "IS" a USB bussed device connection. &nbsp;It works different of course and you can daisy chain a multitude of devices from just one connection with no speed loss. &nbsp;Apple has a multi drive storage unit on their site that gives massive storage
 capability in case a small company wants to grow and not spend a ton of cash to keep up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not used my Thunderbolt connector on the Mac Mini but always use the iPod 5 and iPad Air connector for which I had bought the SD card adapter and also a HDMI video adapter as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I had said, Apple doesn't really create anything but they do engineering work and always team up with industry to get something made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an excellent connector, blazing fast, and not limited. &nbsp;Doesn't take up any space either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, when I go stupid, I have been planning on getting that overpriced 27" monitor for the Mac Mini and the monitor has a docking system built into it. &nbsp;It does not work with PCs but have been thinking of getting two more Mac Minis and wipe the other two
 out and put Linux on one and Windows 8 on the other (I don't like to dual-boot). &nbsp;If Lenovo and Acer has the port, then the Thunderbolt driver is in the Windows Update repository for it. &nbsp;Linux now has the driver for the buss connector for the Surface tablets
 so that issue is out of the way now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 August is the new shipping date for the Surface Pro 3 i3 and i7 models and I plan on getting the i3 model to have for testing and may eliminate all of my other computers and just use it for my Windows machine. &nbsp;Been using my RT all of last week along with
 the Asus T100 (that ATOM "Bay Trail" processor is impressive) and go "small" for everything I got and get rid of all this other junk.</p>

                    If OneDrive and "the cloud" are synonymous, does this mean that when I do a full image backup to an external drive ((Macrium Reflect) the OneDrive folder on my pc will not be backed-up becase it is not on the pc really but "in the Cloud" on a Microsoft

            Dear Sr. GwynEvans,
<br /> 
<br />My name is Alex. I am an - Independent Consultant.
<br />It is an honor to respond to your participation in the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />OneDrive is a service that allows you to store files in the Cloud. You have a client application that synchronizes your files from the cloud to your pc. Any change in both directions will be an exact copy in both places. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/onedrive-video-training-1f608184-b7e6-43ca-8753-2ff679203132?ocmsassetID=1f608184-b7e6-43ca-8753-2ff679203132&amp;wt.mc_id=otc_home&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/onedri...</a>
<br />
<br />Then the correct way to do the backup would be:
<br />
<br />	1. Pause synchronization (right click select "Pause sync 24 hours" ).
<br />	2. Close OneDrive.
<br />	3. Backup.
<br />	4. Start onedrive to upload your backup to the cloud or unload via web. 
<br />
<br />This way you would not have your information duplicated
<br />
<br />Best regards, Alex

<h2>            Externt ljudkort</h2>
                    Kopplade ur och sen in mitt externa USB ljudkort, nu låter ljudet väldigt burkigt, som om det är bakom en dörr eller på avstånd. Fungerade bra innan, men jag testade ett annat kort emellan och när jag kopplade in detta så var ljudet på det här sättet.

<p>Ok I am confused.... I asked this question a month ago. reason I asked it is that I wasn't sure if the date was already expired and well Kenzibit said that its Month/day/year as its an American format. well I just got a warning that says my time is about
 to expire. if it was Month/day/year my time would have expired. as the time is 03/06/2014. and remembering that kenzibit said that's its month/day/year I will say, that is incorrect it its day/month/year. reason for that is, that my time would have expired
 and wouldn't be able to play already and I am able to play.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support. Be sure to&nbsp;ask about known issues&nbsp;in the Dell Forums.<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is
<br />
"possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory
<br />
and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure
<br />
the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully
<br />
inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>
fatal hardware <br />
error</strong>&nbsp;implication.You may need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy
<br />
or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Check the processor seatting, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and<br />
the heat sink which are common causes.<br />
<br />
There have been a few instances&nbsp;where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>&nbsp;

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to
<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes I saw however that information alone does not help that much more than specifying
<br />
the BCCode: 124.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be more information which can be gleaned from the minidump though often<br />
when the issue is hardware related that is not the case.<br />
<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files <br />

            &nbsp; Just to reiterate, I get these blue screens within the first 20 min. of start up. &nbsp;It doesn't always happen, but most of the time I can expect it IF I don't let the computer go through it's boot up process without starting any other programs within that
 first 20 min. or so. &nbsp;At least it seems that way. &nbsp;Then I can operate for the rest of the day with no problems. &nbsp;This includes on line gaming, which I am an alpha tester for certain games that are in the process of being released, this testing will go on for
 at least 4-8 hrs. a day. &nbsp;I give my box a good work out and it seems to be fine once my computer gets past the blue screen. &nbsp;Sometimes, very few at that, after a while I may get a screen freeze and have to restart, but then no blue screen issues come up during
 that restart, or error messages for that matter. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; OK, this morning I had another blue screen when starting up the box. &nbsp;It happened after the desktop was already up and running for a few minutes, as per usual. There was a long steady tone coming from the box when it started to reboot, I actually had
 to manually shut down by holding the start button down &nbsp;before I could reboot. I noticed one of the codes was different so I've included that with the post. &nbsp;I also will include the last couple of mini dump files that I have for you to further explore. &nbsp;This
 is definitely sounding more like a hardware issue, but I am still not sold. &nbsp;Only because of the amount of time I can operate the box during gaming with no issues, where I am most definitely generating a ton of heat. &nbsp;Again, for the most part, this issue is
 in and around the bootup process.</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Both the 7F and the other 124 Bug_Check were analyzed.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 7F, {8, 80050033, 6f8, fffff80002d13a8d}<br />
Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt!KiDoubleFaultAbort+b2 )<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe &lt;- a Windows component which means something else drove<br />
it into Fault.<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x7f_8_nt!KiDoubleFaultAbort+b2<br />
BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x7f_8_nt!KiDoubleFaultAbort+b2<br />
<br />
The 7F with the 1st parameter 08 usually means there are two factors combining to cause the<br />
issue. One of which is likely to be hardware though that is not 100% (see the 08 parameter<br />
information in the troubleshooter below).<br />
<br />
Try to use all the methods you can in the troubleshooter below and the ones previously posted.<br />
If those do not help then there probably is a hardware issue. <br />
<br />
Don't forget to contact Dell Support and ask in their forums. This is especially important in case<br />
there are any known issues with that model. <br />

No real help in this minidump, consider it essentially identical to the previous 124.<br />
<br />
Issue could be the processor, heat sink, or the compound between them though it could be<br />
other hardware or even software.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
ZA can cause this because like all cheap 3rd party firewalls they are errors waiting to happen.<br />
Best to uninstall it and use the Windows Firewall.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Do you have ZoneAlarm or any 3rd party firewall installed? If so that could be the cause.<br />
Other antivirus/security programs could be at least partially responsible.<br />
<br />
This Hotfix "Might" apply however do not use unless you are fairly sure.</p>

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7f&nbsp;0x0000007f&nbsp;with the 00000008 parameter usually means a hardware issue.</strong></p>
<p>Have you added hardware or updated drivers recently? Check Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers have been updated there just before this started happening.</p>
<p>For 7f - this could be a hardware issue such as poorly seated cards or memory, though there are<br />
other causes. Weak powersupply could also lead to this. Use the troubleshooters above and below<br />
and when you get to the&nbsp; drivers and memory sections refer to my previous message above and
<br />
then return to the troubleshooters if needed. </p>
<p>If a PC remove ALL power. Open case, remove and reseat ALL cards, memory chips, and ALL<br />
cables (do not just try to snug) on both ends if they can be reached and on the device ends if not<br />
(removing the cables and reseating them helps to eliminate minor corrosion).&nbsp;On a&nbsp;laptop about<br />
all that can be done is to reseat the memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notice the 08 (double fault) as 1st parameter</strong> means there are likely two causes. Be sure to<br />
Update your drivers manually as using Windows Updates only finds certified drivers and Microsoft<br />
and the Device makers are far behind in that proces. Update NIC, WiFi, BIOS and Video/Display<br />
and other major drivers.</p>
<p>If a Laptop or a PC you might have to take to a shop (not BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.</p>

<strong>BCCode: 7F&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007F&nbsp; which is the same as 0x1000007F</strong></p>
<p>The UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP bug check has a value of 0x0000007F. This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.</p>
<p>This trap could be a <em>bound trap</em> (a trap the kernel is not permitted to catch) or a
<em>double fault</em> (a fault that occurred while processing an earlier fault, which always results in a system failure).</p>
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP Parameters
<p>The first parameter that appears on the blue screen specifies the trap number.</p>
<p>The most common trap codes include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x00000000, or Divide by Zero Error, indicates that a DIV instruction is executed and the divisor is zero. Memory corruption, other hardware problems, or software failures can cause this error.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x00000004, or Overflow, occurs when the processor executes a call to an interrupt handler when the overflow (OF) flag is set.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x00000005, or Bounds Check Fault, indicates that the processor, while executing a BOUND instruction, finds that the operand exceeds the specified limits. A BOUND instruction ensures that a signed array index is within a certain range.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x00000006, or Invalid Opcode, indicates that the processor tries to execute an invalid instruction. This error typically occurs when the instruction pointer has become corrupted and is pointing to the wrong location. The most common cause of this error
 is hardware memory corruption. </p>
</li><li>0x00000008, or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be handled serially, and in this situation
 the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault:
<ul>
<li>A kernel stack overflow. This overflow occurs when a guard page is hit, and the kernel tries to push a trap frame. Because there is no stack left, a stack overflow results, causing the double fault. If you think this overview has occurred, use
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565440(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>!thread</strong></a> to determine the stack limits, and then use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551943(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</strong></a> with a large parameter (for example,
<strong>kb 100</strong>) to display the full stack. </li><li>A hardware problem.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>The less-common trap codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x00000001 -- A system-debugger call</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x00000003 -- A debugger breakpoint</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x00000007 -- A hardware coprocessor instruction with no coprocessor present</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x0000000A -- A corrupted Task State Segment</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x0000000B -- An access to a memory segment that was not present</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x0000000C -- An access to memory beyond the limits of a stack</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x0000000D -- An exception not covered by some other exception; a protection fault that pertains to access violations for applications</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For other trap numbers, see an Intel architecture manual.</p>
Cause
<p>Bug check 0x7F typically occurs after you install a faulty or mismatched hardware (especially memory) or if installed hardware fails.</p>
<p>A double fault can occur when the kernel stack overflows. This overflow occurs if multiple drivers are attached to the same stack. For example, if two file system filter drivers are attached to the same stack and then the file system recurses back in, the
 stack overflows.</p>
Resolution
<p><strong>Debugging:</strong> Always begin with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff562112(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>!analyze</strong></a> extension.</p>
<p>If this extension is not sufficient, use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551943(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>kv (Display Stack Backtrace)</strong></a> debugger command.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>kv</strong> shows a <strong>taskGate</strong>, use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565500(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.tss (Display Task State Segment)</strong></a> command on the part before the colon.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If <strong>kv</strong> shows a trap frame, use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565491(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.trap (Display Trap Frame)</strong></a> command to format the frame.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Otherwise, use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565491(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.trap (Display Trap Frame)</strong></a> command on the appropriate frame. (On x86-based platforms, this frame is associated with the procedure
<strong>NT!KiTrap</strong>.) </p>
</li></ul>
<p>After using one of these commands, use <strong>kv</strong> again to display the new stack.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you recently added hardware to the computer, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies
 to determine which hardware component failed. </p>
<p>The memory scanner is especially important. Faulty or mismatched memory can cause this bug check. For more informaiton about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Check that all adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use
 an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.
</p>
<p>If the error appears on a newly installed system, check the availability of updates for the BIOS, the SCSI controller, or network cards. These kind of updates are typically available on the Web site or BBS of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>Confirm that all hard disk drives, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters are compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
<p>If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, you should remove or replace the driver. If, under this circumstance, the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS, you might
 be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console in order to access the file.
</p>
<p>Also restart your computer, and then press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when you add only one driver or service at a time.</p>
<p>Overclocking (setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification) can cause this error. If you have overclocked the computer that is experiencing the error, return the CPU to the default clock speed setting.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>If you encountered this error while upgrading to a new version of the Windows operating system, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If possible, remove
 all third-party device drivers and system services and disable any virus scanners before you upgrade. Contact the software manufacturer to obtain updates of these tools. Also make sure that you have installed the latest Windows Service Pack.</p>
<p>Finally, if all the above steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can also cause this error.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

            <div>Hi Kensley,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to solve it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We apologize for the inconvenience caused. Please answer the below question for better diagnosis:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you receive any error message when the issue occurs?<br />
2. Did you install the latest updates for Windows?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The issue you face occurs mostly if some of the system file components goes missing or corrupt. So please refer the below methods to troubleshoot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Safe mode and clean boot.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s check if you get the error when you boot the computer in safe mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Safe mode:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. To start your system in safe
 mode follow the below steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
1. Press and hold Shift key and restart your Computer.<br />
2. Select Troubleshoot.<br />
3. Select Advance Option.<br />
4. Select Startup settings.<br />
5. Follow the on Screen instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information refer to the below link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></strong></a><strong>
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not occur in safe mode then place the computer in a Clean Boot and check</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Clean boot.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Disclaimer: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, Let us check if this issue is due to missing or corrupt system file by running SFC scan on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We would ask you to provide us with the event log&nbsp;of your event viewer. Press windows key&nbsp;+ r key and type eventvwr and you will be able to access the event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please let us know if the issue persists or you need any further assistance.</div>

<h3> hatelivemail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost all contacts</h2>
                    <p>Apparently had a virus or malware.&nbsp; Had to hard start computer and recover/restore.&nbsp; Then had to run a lengthy scan which identified the problem(s).&nbsp; Now my Contact list in Windows Live Mail shows no contacts.&nbsp; All the posts on here seem to involve signing
 in to Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I can't do that because I don't think I ever set up an account.&nbsp; To confirm that I tried signing on using both of my email addresses and then hope to try "lost password", but both email addresses get me "This Microsoft account is
 incorrect. Please try again."&nbsp; I am frustrated and angry.&nbsp; My address book contains many, many years worth of entries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: Just signed up for an MSN account.&nbsp; Didn't like giving so much personal info and being forced to accept more email spam from MSN, but I did it because I thought it might help me solve my problem.&nbsp; It didn't.&nbsp; Did I mention I am computer illiterate.&nbsp;
 Reading some of the posts on here is like reading Greek!</p>

 can still see your contact list:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Contacts</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If there are no record of any contacts, I'm sorry to inform you that we can no longer recover your contact list unless you might remember which account you set-up to use Mail. That is the only way for you
 to regain the list of your contacts. You need to remember which account (either Microsoft or non-Microsoft account) you set-up before.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you have remember the account, you may follow the steps given in the this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to add account in Mail. Once your account is configured, your contacts will automatically sync with Mail and from there you can check if the contacts you are searching for are still intact with the account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks. </div>

            <p>Thanks so much for the response and please forgive my ignorance.&nbsp; It's about to show again.&nbsp; I don't get the whole "account" thing.&nbsp; Should I have logically signed up for an account when I got a new computer with Windows 7?&nbsp; A friend who is an IT professional
 migrated everything from my old computer for me.&nbsp; When I took over I clicked on what appeared to be an email icon and went from there.&nbsp; I realized it didn't appear to be Outlook and I notice the moniker "Live Mail" and I figured it was some sort of new email
 program.&nbsp; Like most novices I learned how to operate it by clicking on this and that.&nbsp; When I called up contacts all my previous contacts were there.&nbsp; I never thought much about any of it until all this happened.&nbsp; I guess it's obvious I don't really get the
 difference between Windows Live Mail and Windows Live and Live Messenger.&nbsp; So I don't recall ever setting up an account like I did a week or so again when I set up an account to access this board (where I probably don't belong!).&nbsp; If I&nbsp;had also signed up&nbsp;years
 ago,&nbsp;wouldn't Microsoft have a record of a prior account set up with my email address?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Contacts&nbsp;- well, again, I am not computer savvy.&nbsp; So I called up an Explorer page and pasted that into the address line.&nbsp; When I did I
 got this response, "Windows cannot find C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Contacts.&nbsp; Check spelling and try again."&nbsp; Figuring that may not be the right way to go about it, I clicked
 on the "Start" button and pasted C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Contacts
in the "Search programs and files" space.&nbsp; The response - "No items match your search".&nbsp; So then I called up the list of hard drives and clicked on the C: drive.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;clicked on Program Files, then on Windows Live, then on Contacts.&nbsp;
 There were several files there.&nbsp; All but one had .dll extensions.&nbsp; When I tried to open any of them I got a warning to the effect of "Don't mess with this you computer illiterate!"&nbsp; So I stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now it's time to stop this diatribe.&nbsp; But not before crosssing my fingers that someone here can stoop to my level and give me a hand.&nbsp; I really, really, really hope I haven't lost years worth of contacts.&nbsp; Can I have Outlook back?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like ask what do you mean by your statement " When I called up contacts all my previous contacts were there"? Are you saying that you can able to see your contacts in your account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the difference betwwen the three services of Microsoft, please refer to below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> is part of Windows Live Essentials that helps you organize your mail, calendar, and contacts all in one place on your PC. You can access it even without an Internet Connection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live</strong> is now called <strong>Hotmail, </strong>is a web-based&nbsp;email service of Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Messenger </strong>is an Instant Messaging program where you can communicate to your contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>That was a reference to a couple of years ago when I got a new computer with Windows 7 and my friend migrated everything from my old computer.&nbsp; After he left I clicked on the email icon and even though the program appeared to be different from Outlook, I
 plodded forward and learned to use it.&nbsp; That included clicking on "contacts" and seeing everything there that I was used to seeing, just in a somewhat different format.&nbsp; I guess my point is that when I got a Windows 7 computer my friend somehow moved all my
 contacts from outlook to Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; But I don't remember ever signing up for Windows Live Mail Account.&nbsp; So, again, I know that earlier this year all my contacts (going many years back) were in my WLM "contacts" folder and when I recently had to scan,
 clean and restrart my computer is when I lost everything.&nbsp; BTW, I'm not sure if it matters, but I got all the warnings and had to do the scan after trying to update Java.&nbsp; After some Googling it appears there are issues with Java updates.&nbsp; Could that have
 been the root of the problem????</p>

 Window Live Mail.&nbsp;Sorry.&nbsp; Not stupid, just not computer literate.&nbsp; Most everyone on this site is some sort of cyber expert.&nbsp; I'm not.&nbsp; Just a regular Windows user.&nbsp; I know some of&nbsp;the language is very elementary to you folks, but not for me or anyone in my

<p>I have Soldier of Fortune 1 on disk. I have loaded it onto my Windows 7 64 bit o/s, but it won't run.
</p>
<p>I found what I thought was a 'fix' on youtube. </p>
<p>The fix was to copy sof.exe and rename it to MOHAA but no luck.</p>
<p>If anyone can help, that would be great.</p>

<p>The game was released in 2000 which puts in in the more problematic era.</p>
<p>If you have not tried already, try using <em>Compatibility</em> with <em>Win95/98</em>. This is supposed to force Windows</p>
<p>to run the game on a single cpu core, which can help games from 2002 and earlier occasionally.</p>
<p>- You will also need to enable - <em>Change High DPI settings &gt; Override High DPI Scaling Behavior&nbsp;
</em>in the Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>( helps make old games centre on the screen properly ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There may also be a fan based forum that can direct you to fixes required for the game. Some older types of 3D acceleration</p>
<p>require special fixes for things like colour. Fixes that work on Win7 generally work on Win10 as well.</p>
<p>- Speaking of 3D acceleration - Have you enabled <em>Direct Draw</em> in...</p>
<p><em>Programs and Features - Turn Windows Features On or Off </em></p>
<p>Scroll to and enable <em>Legacy Components &amp; Direct Play .</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>While most old games should run using Integrated graphics, some may not, so if your machine is using an
</p>
<p>integrated graphics processor the game may not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using the GOG download version is more likely to be successful than an original disc version as GOG fix their games to run on newer</p>
<p>versions of Windows. If you can wait, you should be able to pick up the Platinum Edition for 60-75% off the current price</p>
<p>on one of the frequent GOG sales.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I tried the suggestions in your recent email, but sadly, it did not work. It may be that I have to wait on GOG doing their bit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many thanks for taking the time to try and help me out.</p>

            abacus23,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before trying to copy the the disk to your hard drive, lets try a couple other things first.&nbsp;
<br />
I just realized that you never completed the steps from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB928080</a> about error 1722.&nbsp; Lets startwith completing that.<br />
If you were able to download it and run it properly then you will have a folder called "MicrosoftKB928080" located on your C: drive.&nbsp;
<br />
First thing to do is verify that folder does exist.&nbsp; <br />
Click on Start &gt; My Computer &gt; double-click on Local Disk C: <br />
You should see the folder MicrosoftKB928080<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2f2jy5mg.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pPZCTF3tIhq-EpaEPTIgI3rbILnlTWBRRi2EA2ZjHsqxxHZQJr6a1VBqOzlxRFMeIGbBIT2cMyrED4NrfHg1VUGA7E-vsby_v%2fthread1a.JPG" /><br />
<br />
If you don't, you need to follow the instructions from KB928080 to make sure you have downloaded it and run the initial setup.<br />
Once you verify that the folder is there then open up a Command Prompt window and type the following command and press enter:<br />
<strong>c:\microsoftkb928080\resetsldl -All<br />
</strong>The only space is after resetsldl.&nbsp; The command should run and give you a result<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2f2jy5mg.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1p1GWPUKdqL1hiS32uHbrj33981jnCIY_adaMJGCfpl7VHiWTZA50XOj6xNk-GWJJRiGzy484jsaj6BekcIdi8fLKIU8i_DY6B%2fThread1b.JPG" /><br />
<br />
After you complete this and get the result as above then try to re-install the game.<br />
Let us know the results of that.<br />

    <title>Cannot Pin or Organize Icons in Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trackrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Pin or Organize Icons in Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have lost the ability to pin programs to the Start Menu or organize the ones I had already pinned.&nbsp; Also, when I try to turn on "Use Start full screen," it turns back off right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a new computer that I built last night with a new Windows 10 installation.&nbsp; I installed a few programs today, and I pinned a few of them to the Start Menu, resized the icons to small, and moved them around a bit - worked just as well as it always did
 on my old computer.&nbsp; Then I installed a few more programs and went to organize my already-pinned icons before pinning the new(er) programs.&nbsp; Trying to move an icon caused the spinning blue ring, followed by the Start Menu collapsing.&nbsp; Upon re-opening the Start
 Menu, I found that all previous customizations (e.g. I had renamed a group) were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some searching, and tried the suggested fix of unpinning and re-pinning programs.&nbsp; The context menu comes up to Pin, but I can't re-pin the apps that had previously been pinned or pin anything else.&nbsp; I tried to turn on "Use Start full screen" but it
 didn't seem to make any difference to the Start Menu, and the setting goes back to Off as soon as I go to another window and back.</p>

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />

<br />
<br />Is Windows showing as activated?
<br />
<br />
<br />While in the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Sync your Settings

<p>Windows does show as activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off Theme syncing and restarted.&nbsp; I have the icons I had in Start prior to whatever happened, I can re-size them, and I can pin new programs, but trying to move them crashes (or closes, anyway) the Start Menu (and the re-sizing gets undone.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I still can't turn on Use Start in Full Screen or change any other Start Menu settings.</p>

<h2>            Dcom 10016 Error, flooding event viewer causing flickers, screen lockups and unresponsiveness requiring hard reset</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Had the error originally with 9CA88...{Screenshot below}. Was causing lock ups one to two times daily sometimes requiring hard reset and screen blinks/flashes throughout the day. This is my fathers PC which I setup for him, brand new install dont know how
 this came about, either way resolved that error and a second runtime appeared with a similiar error but I cannot clear this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>{2593F****83378-1001) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services
 administrative tool.</div>
<p>
</p><p>The permissions in CLSID are as follows: Administrators, Users, TrustedInstaller, Home = Full Control</p>
<p>AppID is the exact same. Administrators is the owner of both</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the permissions look like for both runtime brokers. They are the exact same, what am I missing here.</p>
<p>

<p>Edit: So I was hoping that this new error would at least not cause the hassle of the old one....nope currently using it and has blacked out the screen and returned to normal twice in two hours.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Regarding the issue with the DCOM 10016,
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">these 10016 events are recorded when Microsoft components tries to access DCOM components without the required permissions.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A coding pattern has been implemented where the code first tries to access the DCOM components with one set of parameters. If the first
 attempt is unsuccessful, it tries again with another set of parameters. The reason why it does not skip the first attempt is because there are scenarios where it can succeed. In those scenarios, that is preferable. However, these events can be safely ignored
 because they do not adversely affect functionality and are by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To prevent the events from being logged, follow these steps to grant permission to the DCOM components that have specific CLSIDs and
 APPIDs.</span></p>

            I mean I cannot resolve this I have no way of doing so, because I have "solved" the problem. The permissions have been granted yet still it persists. On my own PC this is an annoyance I get the rare crash and the occasional screen lock up, it is much more
 prolific on my fathers PC. So two PCs that are not running 100% because I made the mistake of installing W10

<p>If I remember right, I think you have to have the adapter in the controller and then update the controller.
</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I'm sure that's what I had to do when I bought mine all those moons ago.</p>
