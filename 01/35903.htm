<h2>            Updates does not work on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I'm at my wit's end. I'm about to dump Windows 7 and well I don't really know where I'll go after that. I've just had enough. Updates NEVER works. How am I supposed to keep my system updated if this damn thing WON'T WORK. I can't believe I can't find an
 answer to my problem. I've tried all the suggestions&nbsp;I have found with no success. Surely I'm not the only human on this planet with this problem. This is not normal. I've never had a version of Windows that refused to update before.&nbsp; And I worked in IT and
 I've seen thousands of Windows systems. None of my friends have this problem.</p>
<p>I run check for updates from the Control Panel. Most times it finds updates (sometimes if won't even do that) but it refuses to download anything and it just sits there like a brain-dead piece of ____ doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Could someone PLEASE tell me what the ____ is going on????? Better yet tell me how to fix it once and for all.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 fried my computer</h2>
                    Need to speak with someone regarding Windows 10 updates that have completely locked up my computer. &nbsp;We called tech support who had no solution. &nbsp;Windows 10 initial update screwed up my display (incessant blinking). &nbsp;When trying to fix this issue, Windows
 tried pushing more updates that have completely locked up my computer. &nbsp;Tried rebooting about 50 times today, tried running in safe mode, tried doing a system refresh back to before the latest update. &nbsp;Every time it reboots, it tries to update again and locks
 up. &nbsp;This is insane!

            Hi Jennifer.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Be assured only hardware can fry.  Windows is software that at worst needs to be reinstalled and then if it's done carefully will resolve most all of these problems in the future.  So if you want to work with me we'll get it either fixed, reset or reinstalled to have a much better WIndows that wont' put you through this like an inferior Factory or Upgrade (is this both?) install does.
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I tried a system restore earlier today which took two hours and when it rebooted, it reverted back to trying to update again, which locked up the computer. &nbsp;We ended up right back where we started. &nbsp;I'm concerned that resetting my PC will wipe out my app/data
 on my computer. &nbsp;I have some very important downloads that I cannot risk losing. &nbsp;Tech support couldn't assure me that we could get these back. &nbsp;Extremely frustrated with the level of Microsoft support. &nbsp;I've spent all day on this.

            So by now you should know if the is regular Windows Updates that caused it or Spring Creators Version 1803 which wipes out all Restore points and can only be rolled back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery or via Repair Mode accesssed by one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was regular Windows Updates and System REstore won't work then I'd do the Reset which will save your files if you don't have them properly backed up.  I don't know what AppData you want to save but it is not advisable because reimporting it is a corruption path since it could very well be what is causing the Updates or Version Upgrade to go sideways. 
<br />
<br />If you'll answer the above then I can help guide you better.  We are volunteers here and not Microsoft but as long as you want to work with us cooperatively there is nothing we will not do to get you back up and running, and since my speciality is installs which I've helped millions of consumers do via my tutorials, now is the time to get a great install that will be resilient to Windows 10's relentless Updates onslaught.

            Honestly I don't understand what specific Windows 10 updates have caused my computer to fail. &nbsp;When I tried to fix the display issue today from one of the Windows 10 updates, it updated again and froze up my computer. &nbsp;I haven't been able to get back into
 it. &nbsp;I don't understand how I can safely back up my files/apps/data when I can't get into my computer. &nbsp;I have estate data in a Turbotax download (among other things) that I cannot risk losing. &nbsp;I am confident that it's not causing the corruption issues. &nbsp;Windows
 10 is the culprit. &nbsp;I'm not trying to sound dumb here, but how can I even follow any of your paths/settings when I can't get into my computer? &nbsp;I am using my iPad to reply here. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.

            Hi again Jennifer.  
<br />
<br />All of those steps assume you cannot get into Windows 10.  There is a step included to use the same bootable media used for repairs or reinstall to copy out your files which I included and you must have missed.  Read it here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />For Turbotax, unless you redirected the data file to another location, then default location is Public Documents, so I'd be sure to check there to copy out anything Turbotax so it doesn't get missed.  This is also included in my Clean Install tutorial I linked which may tip you to many other things to remember to back up, and how to then restore these and all other software.

            I've read through everything, and I'm sorry but I still don't understand how to even get to settings from the advanced startup to back up my files. &nbsp;And I don't know what a Bios boot key is.

                    <p>
You can not run IIS after updating Windows 10 to 1709 (16299.192).<br />
Communiate when starting the WAS error service 13. I can not start IIS.<br />
An attempt to reinstall the components did not help.<br />
Does anyone have a solution to this problem?

            Win ver 1803 compilation 17134.48<br />
Again a problem with IIs after updating.<br />
Does anyone have a solution yet. Previously, I was able to fix it completely by uninstalling IIS. Currently, it does not help.

            Hi Glen
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Check your hard disk for any errors:
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>

<p><br />
Are you asking if the threat is real or fake, or if Windows Defender is real or fake? Windows Defender is a part of Vista, but that doesn't mean you are using it. Do you have the green WD icon in the notification area? Is that the program that is reporting
 the threat? What was the name of the threat?</p>
<p><br />
Download and run the free versions of these two programs. </p>

<h3> miketinva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime Error</h2>
                    <p>My brother has a Toshiba laptop running Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; He is getting this pop-up:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library</strong></p>
<p><strong>X Runtime Error!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Program: C:\Program File...</strong></p>
<p><strong>R6034</strong></p>
<p><strong>An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please contact the application's support team for more information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>It looks suspicious to me in that it does not indicate a specific program, but only provides "Program File...".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Everything seems to run OK, although sometimes it is difficult to get the laptop to boot up -- it will begin bootup but shuts back off almost immediately...even before the Toshiba Logo appears.&nbsp; Not sure if the two are related...?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions on next steps?</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Windows Store on PC too slow&#33;&#33; TOO SLOW&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am downloading "HP Smart" app on Windows Store, it is only 40 MB large, and still I reached only 20 MB in half an hour!?!?!?!
</p>
<p>On 40 Mbps network!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really???? On Google store it takes only 15 seconds! What is the problem??</p>

<p>Probably an issue between the ISP and the server where that the data is stored on (which is regional and different for every user state/country/regional area).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I just download the entire thing in under 45 seconds, using the "cheapest possible Cox internet service available in Oklahoma City" (because I'm a cheap person and don't want to pay for better speed).&nbsp; I recorded the entire thing with
 a stopwatch running as soon as the download began. If you want to see here's a video of my screen from about 3 minutes ago: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyeN7lKZckE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">YouTube: Demo of Installing HP Smart for MartinKr8</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZyeN7lKZckE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZyeN7lKZckE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But anyway, I'd say it's probably a transient issue and to ignore it, or see if your ISP has any routing issues reaching the server.&nbsp; Most likely the issue will resolve itself without you having to do anything.&nbsp; Has nothing to do with Microsoft or Android,
 but rather the connection between you to them, which could involve dozens or hundreds of other servers in between.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer and your effort. I think I have a "thing" with Windows Store, because every application I try to download on my PC, it takes hours!</p>
<p>I don't have any issues with other services and pages, download speed is OK. But downloading from Windows Store is really a issue for me...</p>
<p>So, I think "<span>cheapest possible Cox internet service available in Oklahoma City" is better than "probably the fastest internet service in Croatia" üòÇ</span></p>

    <title>TV setup wizard comes up every time I start XBOX - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            TV setup wizard comes up every time I start XBOX</h2>
                    
<p>I randomly had the issue of no TV video or no TV sound when i start the xbox. &nbsp;Powering off and on fixed it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT &nbsp;</p>
<p>It just got worse since i got back from vacation. now EVERY SINGLE FREAKING TIME it starts the
<strong>first time user&nbsp;TV&nbsp;wizard</strong>. &nbsp;IF i choose skip, i get a screen that says it cant display video. If i click start wizard, wait for sound (video never shows) then click skip it goes right to tv and works fine until i turn off the tv.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Its making me nuts and my wife more nuts because she is using a Logitech harmony and does not understand how to navigate this screen.</p>
<p>Nothing I do makes the welcome screen stop coming up. I came on here to submit a ticket for support and there support system is down. .. so frustrating. I think I'm about to give up on tv and move my tv back to its own input.</p>
<p>Sharp 60" HDTV</p>
<p>Onkyo Receiver</p>
<p>Tivo Priemire</p>
<p>Tivo &gt;----HDMI----&gt;Xbox IN || Xbox Out &gt;----HDMI----&gt;Onkyo TV Input || Onkyo Monitor &gt;----HDMI----&gt;Sharp TV</p>
<p>So now if i turn it on and i get no sound or video I cold boot it after going through the annoying wizard. &nbsp;But I have to go through the wizard every power up regardless... win or lose. &nbsp; Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>I searched and have not seen anyone else mention the wizard problem which makes me nervous.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Forza 7 Code&#58; 0x8024001E Error</h2>
                    I have just received my brand new Alienware PC that apparently comes with a Forza 7 download - so I head to the MS Store to download it only to be greeted by&nbsp;Code: 0x8024001E every time I try. This is a brand new PC, I have literally done nothing more
 than switch it on. The download gets so far, at one point nearly 50GB into the process but ultimately bins out every time with the same error code. Hitting the retry button seems to pick up where the d/l left off so I will keep trying that way but frankly,
 it seems a pretty crap process. Steam seems to manage downloads without issue so why is MS having so many problems with this?

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + X.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select ‚ÄúCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äù from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let‚Äôs restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

                    Recently, I am now unable to get the video to work.&nbsp; Where can I find the settings for the video?&nbsp; Not sure if some update was installed that changed the setting as it used to work just fine, but no longer.

            Hi Ryan,<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Skype for Business 16.0.4266.1001 is not the newest version. Please confirm whether it can be upgraded on your side. Generally, we can upgrade our Office version via any Office App (such as ‚ÄúWord‚Äù, ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù or the Outlook client)&gt; ‚ÄúFILE‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúOffice
 Accounts‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúUpdate now‚Äù. <br />
<br />
Moreover, according to your description ‚ÄúWe are Windows 7 user with Microsoft Office 2010 installed‚Äù, may I understand that you are using both the Office 2016 and 2010 in your Windows 7 PC? If so, you can try un-install the Office 2010 via
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Fix-It tool</a> (Option 2). <br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I‚Äôd like to confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are the detailed steps about presenting the PowerPoint in your Skype for Business? It has a strange error message containing the word ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue persist under a different network environment?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does any other user in your organization has the same issue?<br />
<br />
Any update is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>Hi Alan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are big organization, any update will take several testing and procedure is bit long.</p>
<p>Update may not an good option, need to testing new version is fix the problem, we can push the new update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, we are using Microsoft office 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype for business is 2017. We have many people using application and all of them having the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 'iphone words' is the ppt file name. Doesn't impact anything. Change different ppt file, same error with different ppt name.</p>
<p>2. The issue happened on other environment as well.</p>
<p>3. All users have same issue. </p>
<p>4. Previous using Lync 2010 without any issue.</p>
<p>

            Hi Ryan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
I‚Äôd like to confirm whether you are using Office 2010 besides the Skype for Business 2016 or you are using both Offic3 2010 and 2016.
<br />
<br />
If the former situation, we suggest you un-install the Office programs (including Skype for Business 2016) via the Fix-it tool which I have previously mentioned in the last reply and re-install the Office programs via
<a href="http://portal.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Portal</a>&gt; ‚ÄúInstall now‚Äù; if the latter situation, we suggest you use only one version Office programs (Office 2010/2016) in your PC.<br />
<br />
Also, updating the Office programs is very simple and you can do it via the method I provided in my last reply.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<p>Hello karistouf,</p>
<p>You can try the following troubleshooting steps for Error 1935, <br />
Method 1</p>
<p>This error may occur when the Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the computer is damaged or is missing.</p>
<p>Try the below step to reinstall and repair the Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the computer and later check if you can install the software.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Start button, click&nbsp; Control Panel, click Programs, and then click "Turn Windows features on or off." If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate Microsoft .NET framework 3.5.1, uncheck the box, click OK and restart the computer.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the restart again open "Turn Windows features on or off" and place&nbsp; a check mark next to Microsoft .NET framework 3.5.1 and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Method 2</p>
<p>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you manually download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package and check if you can install the software.</p>
<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86)</p>

<p>hi maylin,</p>
<p>thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>unfortunately there is nothing showing up about Windows feature,i have a blank white window, instead of a list of windows features. so i cant neither locate neither disable 3.5.1. 4.0 was automatically installed.</p>
<p>3.5 doesnt show up neither in Uninstall Programms List.</p>
<p>every day my computer is trying to install an update of&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86); but it cant.</p>
<p>I cant neither do a restauration to the point before i uninstall 2005 and 2008 that where installed at the very beginning ( sony's advice was to uninstall them, so what i did)</p>
<p>I think something is going wrong with .NET and I really need to install&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable with the 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any log to extract and send you here to help to have a precise idea of what is going on ?</p>

<p>Hello karistouf,</p>
<p>First, lets see if we can resolve the issue with Windows Programs and Feature dialog box is blank.<br />
Click on the KB article below to see if helps to resolve the issue. <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article ID: 931712</a> - The "Windows Features" dialog box is empty in Windows 7 or Windows Vista, or you receive error code "0x80073712" when you try to use Windows Update</p>
<p>Next, download the System Update Readiness Tool from here. <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article ID: 947821</a> - Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<p>Once the readiness tool runs, you can check the log files that it creates: <br />
%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log <br />
%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log</p>
<p>Please let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status. </p>

<p>1. Have you try to uninstall and reinstall the game? </p>
<p>2. What happens when you launch the game? Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Compatibility center states that the game is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Doom%203%3A%20BFG&amp;vendor=Bethesda%20Softworks&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;BreadCrumbPath=doom%203%3A%20bfg&amp;LastSearchTerm=doom%2B3%253a%2Bbfg&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks guys,<br />
this conversation helped me to repair system files, also appeared Error: 0x800f0906 but i fixed it by uninstalling update KB3022345(programs and features).<br />
I had also the other problem with online games and in case you have not updated drivers for a half year, most probably are the drivers your problem(new almost every month(VGA,LAN,WLAN,AUDIO and other that might not be critical)).

            You would need to backup your data and burn the ISO to a DVD or create a USB install and do a clean install (which will give you a clean OS, you'll need to reinstall all your programs).

<p>Was impressed when I first saw Windows 7 at the dock that you could organize and add icons to instead of using typical desktop icons.&nbsp; It almost made the computer look like a MAC.&nbsp; My hard drive fried after 3 weeks and when I got the replacement, I couldn't

<h2>            Can&#39;t install pinball fx2 in windows 8 0x80073cf1 windows store</h2>
                    I am trying to install this program but each time it fails with error&nbsp;0x80073cf9. Other programs, e.g. Microsoft Solitaire, work fine. I have tried:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Flushing the store cache</div>
<div>2. Renaming&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</div>
<div>3. Updating video drivers</div>
<div>4. disabling all non-microsoft start up programs and services</div>
<div>5. reading the event viewer logs. Found this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>error 0x80073CF9: AppX Deployment operation failed. The specific error text for this failure is: Deployment Stage operation on Package Microsoft.Studios.PinballFx2_1.1.0.299_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe from: &nbsp;(x-windowsupdate://40F66DD8-AEFA-40A8-B5B5-D01F67F1681F/eefd84e494fbc20f0106e4f276a2555864fa7ab4)
 &nbsp;failed with error 0x80246002. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235160 for help diagnosing app deployment issues.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But that doesn't really help 0x80246002 is a very generic error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it because my hardware doesn't support pinball fx2? I find that hard to believe since I have seen reports of people running it fine (though too slowly to play) in vmware.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an x61 tablet which has 2GB RAM, 500GB HDD, core2duo 1.6 Ghz, gma965 intel video (x3100).&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>I installed a fresh copy of windows (trial version) on my desktop to a vhd, installed pinball fx2 to it and copied the vhd to my laptop. After driver updates, pinball fx2 worked fine so clearly the laptop meets the hardware requirements. I don't know
 if I would have got the same result if I had done the VHD install on the laptop in the first instance. Note that my laptop install was an in-place upgrade from windows 7.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, I tried installing ilomilo on the laptop and got exactly the same type of errors originally, but now&nbsp;</span><span>ilomilo&nbsp;installs normally.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>I changed the graphics driver to "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" and then both pinball fx2 and hydro thunder installed. After installing them, I changed the driver back to the proper one.</div>

            <p>I wanted to download an App from the Windows Store. Speaking Spanisch fluently. I have paid for it over my credit Card but unfortunately I can't download it. I have contacted the firm Advocation01ltd and asked them about the Problem and they have sent me

    <title>cannot remove read only from folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot remove read only from folder</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to remove the blue check next to "Read-only (Only applies to files in the folders). The reason is we are using autocad and when we try to setup our configuration files for it it doesn't let us because it saves to this folder C:\users\xxxx\local\appdata\temp
 and when I uncheck the read only box it comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have done to try to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncheck the box, apply, ok</p>
<p>ensured under security the user has full control of this folder (temp)</p>
<p>went to advanced, owner, and granted user ownership of the folder</p>
<p>went to effective permissions tab and selected the user name and ensured all effective permissions were checked</p>
<p>ensured under permissions tab user has full control</p>
<p>I have downloaded the add_ownership reg file and applied it to this folder</p>
<p>I added the user to the administrator group in windows</p>
<p>I have tried the attribute commands in command prompt such as attrib -r +s "C:\users\xxxx\local\appdata\temp"</p>
<p>I have downloaded third party apps such as attribute manager and the box still does not uncheck blue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>it keeps coming back and is preventing us from working properly.</p>
<p>I have tried this on other computers off our domain to see if it was a group policy thing , it isn't - still having the issue on brand new PCs with windows on them off the domain. I would say this is definitely a windows issue for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here are some other things I've tried:</p>
<p>disabling anti virus</p>
<p>uninstalling antivirus</p>
<p>ran malware bytes</p>
<p>installing windows on a brand new pc and trying the same with no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried everything in the book</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>this still didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>we ended up just changing the location where autocad saves to another folder instead</p>
<p>
