<p>Anyone know when we are going to get the update to allow use of the Hauppage tuner.&nbsp; I bought the tuner a few weeks ago unknowing it would only work for Preview members. I am anxiously waiting on&nbsp;this update. Any news would be awesome.</p>

<p>I spent over a hundred dollars on the tuner and antenna hooked it up and nothing. Preview Program!! &nbsp;Whats even more dissapointing is I dont have any friends whom I can ask to invite me into the program. I was moderated for asking in the forums. Seems its
 a touchy subject. Hell, I even messaged the Major but no reply. Dude Ive been playing the Xbox brand since 2001 and its upsetting to want to be part of something you love but are treated like a whiny B</p>

<p>I believe you can put something in your signature requesting an invite without any issues, but I wouldn't quote me on that. Plus, by the time you get the invite and sign up, it can take a little while before you get accepted, might as well just wait it out,
 the update will get released soon enough.</p>

<p>@truth once you hooked up the tuner and antenna, did you then run the tuner through its tuning set up process? Without doing this you will get nothing.</p>
<p>*edit. Just realised you are saying you are not in preview. Quicker just to wait until it goes live for everyone now. Not really wasted as you wanted it anyway and will have it working soon.</p>

<p>I bought my Tuner (Hauppague) at Best Buy Canada. &nbsp;They seem to have a mix of inventory on the shelves so I was able to pick up the WinTV-HVR-955Q for same retail price as the 950Q. &nbsp; Imagine the smile on my face. :) &nbsp; &nbsp; Now waiting for approval for my registration
 for he preview program and will test from there. &nbsp; I have 14 days to return the tuner (with receipt) if I need to.</p>

    <title>How to repair file permissions of app packages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to repair file permissions of app packages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the problem that most of the Windows Store apps stopped working after I tried to stop sharing my user folder in Explorer. My files were visible from other PCs in the network, so I tried&nbsp;to disable that and right-clicked on my account folder (C:\Users\MyUserName)
 and selected Share with -&gt; Stop sharing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to have reset some file permissions that are crucial for Store apps to work. Now apps apparently don't have access to the AppData/Local/Packages subfolders anymore and immediately crash when starting. The exception thrown is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eine nicht behandelte Ausnahme des Typs "System.Exception" ist in mscorlib.dll aufgetreten.</p>
<p>WinRT-Informationen: Error trying to initialize the application data container server</p>
<p>Zusätzliche Informationen: Fehler beim Laden des Statusspeichers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also checked Process Monitor logs and&nbsp;they show ACCESS DENIED errors for the \Settings\settings.dat files in AppData/Local/Packages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how I get these permission errors fixed? I really don't want to use the Refresh Windows option&nbsp;since I have lots of Desktop apps installed with their settings and would like to keep them if possible. Also I am not sure if the Refresh option would
 actually repair those errors. I am using Windows 8 Pro x64 by the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

            <p>Thanks Pinaki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Microsoft account, no local account and I do not have other accounts on the PC. I ran the commands you mentioned for one of the app directories under AppData/Local/Packages but the corresponding app still cannot access Settings.dat and crashes.
 I don't understand why. Process Monitor shows the app tries to access the file under my user account and I myself have perfectly access to all files (the security tab in Explorer shows for all the&nbsp;files including the Settings.dat: SYSTEM, my user account and
 the Administrators group having full access). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It must have something to do with that special permission that got removed when I clicked "Stop sharing". I checked the permissions in a fresh VM and there appears&nbsp;an "Account Unknown (S-1-15-...)" for the subfolders in AppData/Local/Packages/appname. When
 I remove this exact entry the app fails to start. And this entry is missing on my main installation. So to resolve my issue I need to add that permission back I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like every app package folder has its own different permission set with a different SID (probably to prevent apps from accessing anything outside their own package folder). I granted now full rights to the entire Packages folder for
<font>S-1-15-2-1</font><font> which is the SID of the group&nbsp;"All app packages" and my apps are working now again (<a href="http://blendinsider.com/xaml/known-issue-xaml-designer-in-visual-studio-11-beta-crashes-on-launch-2012-03-07/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this helped</a>).
 :) Not optimal but better than nothing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>There really should be a repair utility for the Windows Store that resets permissions for all packages to what they should be.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw the new&nbsp;title of this thread describes something completely different than my issue. I myself&nbsp;did have&nbsp;access to the files and the files are not on the network either.</p>

    <title>vertical taskbar width reset by Aero - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornan the iowan  say:</h3>
<h2>            vertical taskbar width reset by Aero</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to follow this bug in Aero if Microsoft has already recorded it, or learn where to report it formally if not.</p>
<p>Here is my setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows taskbar on right edge of screen </li><li>"desktop" toolbar enabled on the taskbar </li><li>taskbar sized to show three columns of icons in the desktop toolbar, which also shows a reasonable amount of each program's title bar (a "win-win" configuration, if you'll pardon the pun)</li></ul>
<p>With Aero enabled, various events (one is "switch user") will re-size the vertical toolbar to approximately the width of one column of icons.&nbsp; (This may be a coincidence, as I see that other users are unable to keep their vertical Aero toolbar as
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">narrow</span> as they want).</p>
<p>I have observed this behavior on Windows 7 Ultimate (2 machines) and Windows 7 Home Premium (1 machine).</p>
<p>The work-around is to use Windows Classic Mode, which also avoids other problems with Aero such as Aero animations that cannot be turned off individually.</p>
<p><strong>If there is a KB article or Connect item or other formal record of this bug, I would appreciate its name / link so that I may follow it.</strong></p>
<p>I should note that using Windows 7 "Basic" mode is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> a work-around, because some "advanced" / "appearance" settings will be reset in<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that</span> mode (a separate bug).</p>

<h2>            ATI Radeon 7500 driver and windows 7 aero</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I loaded my IBM thinkpad t42 with windows 7 Ultimate today, problem I have is that apparantly this graphic card or driver doesnt support aero??<br />
<br />
I get this error <br />
<br />
The current video card may support Aero with a driver that is compliant with the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM).&nbsp; Contact the manufacturer of your computer or video card for a WDDM-compatible driver.<br />
<br />
Video card driver does not support aero effect<br />
<br />
Please can someone point me in the right directions, as I cannot stand the basic look of windows 7,<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hi,<br />
<br />
sorry, the Radeon 7500 doesn't support DirectX9 PixelShaders, so you <strong>can't have Aero Glass</strong> . For Aero Glass you need at least a Radeon 9500!<br />

            <p>Don't know if it will work for your model but I re-installed the drivers for my MP150 and it has worked ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So whatever OS drivers you were using when you first installed it then install them again or delete the driver and install it again.</p>

<h2>            How do I make it so Taskbar icons will always maximize the window when hovering over them with a file for drag and drop applications&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When uploading files or importing them into programs via the drag and drop method (and only on a single monitor) I find that I am always minimizing and dragging icons over the program task bar but sometimes it will not always maximize the program, especially
 if I am in another window then try to do this... to get it to work I will have remaximize the window I want to drag and drop to and then re minimize it and then drag the icon back over, then it will reopen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is a trick / configuration / hack to always have the task bar icons always maximize the window when an icon is being held over them?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Renaming physcial disk FriendlyName via powershell</h2>
                    Hi everybody -
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running into an odd error when trying to execute a simple powershell command on a specific drive within my storage pool.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The pool has 7 drives. To help identify them, I physically labeled them 1 through 7, and wanted to relabel them via their 'Friendly Name' in PowerShell using the following command:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Set-PhysicalDisk -FriendlyName "PhysicalDisk0" -NewFriendlyName "Disk 04"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This command has worked on every single drive except one - a Western Digital RED 3TB. It is in a healthy state, and Western Digitals Data Lifeguard Diagnostics Tool has returned flawless results on every single test.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the error code I recieve:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>set-physicaldisk : Not Supported</div>
<div>At line:1 char:1</div>
<div>+ set-physicaldisk -friendlyname "PhysicalDisk0" -newfriendlyname "Disk 04"</div>
<div>+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; + CategoryInfo &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: InvalidOperation: (StorageWMI:ROOT/Microsoft/..._StorageCmdlets) [Set-PhysicalDisk], Cim</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Exception</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; + FullyQualifiedErrorId : StorageWMI 1,Set-PhysicalDisk</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even have two others of the exact same drive within the pool, so I have no idea as to what is causing the error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Keyboard&#47;mouse now wakes my computer from hibernate</h2>
                    <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of hibernation was that it can only be turned back on by pressing the power button and couldn't be woken up by mouse/keyboard.&nbsp; My old computer and my laptop acts this way.&nbsp; I've just built a new computer and
 noticed that it wakes from hibernation from both the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; Is this a new feature?&nbsp; If so, is there a way to undo this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps the issue was with hybrid sleep being selected, but I turned it off and it still wakes from hibernation so that wasn't it.&nbsp; USB selective suspending is also enabled so when it's in hibernation, it should be suspending my keyboard/mouse
 but apparently it's still monitoring those signals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to un-check "allow this device to wake the computer" because I still want to be able to wake my computer from sleep using my mouse/keyboard.&nbsp; But when I'm in hibernation, I want it to act like it's off and ignore mouse/keyboard inputs.&nbsp; There
 should be a way to do this, right?&nbsp; This was how my old computer acted so I would hope so...</p>

            Since you are hibernating, you won't need to use 'allow this device to wake the computer', but when you choose to, you can always check it again.
<br />
<br />You can try resetting your BIOS defaults to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a> 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

<p>Hi Andre, thanks for your response.&nbsp; Below are my responses to your questions/suggestions.&nbsp; But from your overall response, it sounds like this is a bug and/or beyond the control of Windows, and that the computer should not be waking up from hibernate from
 a keyboard/mouse?&nbsp; That's what I thought as well, but doing a quick search on the internet regarding this issue shows a couple of other instances where people show that it is possible to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You can try resetting your BIOS defaults to see if it resolves the problem.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently reset the BIOS already so I don't think that's the issue.&nbsp; I guess I could try it again if nothing else works, but it's such a hassle to open up my computer and short the leads to reset the CMOS that I'd rather try other options before doing
 this again, if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What is the make and model of your computer?&nbsp;</em><br />
I built my desktop so there's no standard make/model.&nbsp; The motherboard I have is a Gigabyte&nbsp;GA-AB350N-Gaming WIFI.&nbsp; It does have BIOS options to power on the computer via the mouse and keyboard, but I have that setting turned off, and even if I had it on, the
 motherboard manual says it's only for PS/2 input mouse/keyboard anyway, so it wouldn't work for my devices (both are USB).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?</em><br />
</p>
<p>I've toggled hybrid sleep on and off, wondering if that was the issue.&nbsp; I have never tried using hybrid sleep but decided to try using it on this computer.&nbsp; The issue persists regardless of whether hybrid sleep is on or off.&nbsp; The only way to prevent my mouse/keyboard
 from waking my computer from hibernate is to uncheck "<span>allow this device to wake the computer" in Device Manager.&nbsp; I tested it and it prevents wakeup in hibernate.&nbsp; However, as mentioned in my
 first post, I would still like to have my mouse/keyboard wake my computer from sleep so this isn't the best solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>How long has this been happening?&nbsp;</em><br />
</p>
<p>I just noticed it yesterday when I started using my new computer.&nbsp; This never happened with either my old desktop or my current laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?</em></span></p>
<p>My new computer has Windows 10 Home edition, version 1703.&nbsp; And as far as I'm aware, I was/am using the same version of Windows on both my old desktop and my current laptop.</p>

<p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your pc/device needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors.

<p>You'll need to use recovery tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have any installation media (Like a &nbsp;disc/usb device), contact your PC admin or Pc manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is the problem:</strong></p>
<p>I downloaded Windows 10 approx. a week ago. Windows 10 working perfectly until above screen message came up. It's very frustrating, as even my mouse is disabled and I cannot get out of this screen. There was
<strong>no disc&nbsp;</strong>with the PC, as I had Windows 8 on the&nbsp;pc and just downloaded Win 10 directly from Microsoft's website. The HP computer is&nbsp;at least 7 yrs. old, so I'm sure HP is not going to want to have anything to do with me and my "ancient pc."
 (Note: although the pc was 7 yrs old, it had only been used for Word documents,&nbsp;[no email or internet usage]&nbsp;so it&nbsp;is in pristine condition.)&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>You can download some free data recovery software as follows to recover deleted files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Panda Recovery http://www.pandorarecovery.com<br />

<p>If you want to try these recovery programs to recover your lost data , then you should stop using your hard drive immediately so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.</p>
How does it work?
<p>When you delete a file on FAT32 or NTFS file system, its content is not erased from disk but only reference to file data in File Allocation Table or Master File Table is marked as deleted. It means that you might be able to recover deleted files, or make
 it visible for file system again.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 blue screen after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saintamant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen after update</h2>
                    I had windows 7 on my computer and upgraded to windows 10. It has been running fine for about 3 months and then Microsoft installed an update, well it started running really slow booting up and all of the icons were taking forever to appear on the desktop,
 so I shut it down and restarted. It would go through the windows boot screen process and just a blank screen would appear. I would have to shut it down because it would never get to the log in screen. I've tried restore and says there are no restore points
 which I know there are. I've tried safe mode and it wont boot up in safe mode, same blank screen. Tried resetting and recovery, but no luck. I can get to the command prompt. I can also see my files when you select the option to load a recovery image, but I
 do not have a recovery image for the windows 10 only a CD that I made with my previous windows 7 version. I don't have a windows 10 key, because I upgrade from windows 7 and I only have the windows 7 key. Can you reinstall windows

<h2>            SMS calls from&#47;to Australia worldwide</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I need to make and receive calls and SMS to/from Australia traveling worldwide. I should be identified as Australian number. So when I call or SMS, the receiver should see an Australian number. And they should be able to return a call or SMS to this Australuan
 number. This sms or call should come to Skype or be forwarded to a Russian number. Is it possible? What Skype service do I need to meet these requirements? Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>unfortunately, this scenario won't be possible.</p>
<p>You can (on Skype):</p>
<ul>
<li>have Skype Number to accept calls on your skype when people call that number from their phones (or you can also forward these calls to your russian number, but you will need Skype Credit or subscription to russian numbers)</li><li>make calls and send SMS from Skype with Skype Credit (and for calling with appropriate subscription)</li><li>setup your Caller ID to show your number</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can't (on Skype):</p>
<ul>
<li>receive SMS on your Skype</li><li>use your Skype Number as Caller ID, so that people would see your calls as coming from Australia</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As a possible solution would be getting an Australian number from Australian mobile provider and use it for your Caller ID. This would allow you to make calls and send SMS with Australian caller ID and receive them back on that number. This is not ideal,
 as you would still receive call backs and SMS on that number in phone, but would allow you to at least make the calls as if you were in Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            Skype Mobile Account Suspended&#47;Microsoft Account Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened my Skype app this afternoon and saw that my account was logged out “for my security” according to the banner. I was trying to sign back in but all it said was something went wrong with my Microsoft account and I was to go to account.live.com to
 fix it. I did and changed my password and verified my account twice and I still can’t get into my Skype account. I’ve been going back and forth the two accounts these past few hours but nothing’s working. I have very urgent matters to attend to on skype so
 a quick solution to this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 missing RocketRaid 2300 drivers.</h2>
                    <p>I found the solution, the windows 8 driver works.</p>
<p>"Windows Server 2012, 2008R2 / Windows 8.1,8,7 (32/64-bit) "</p>
<p>http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/cs-series_rr2300_download.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>But of course until you install it your drives on the raid card are inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just thought I'd post this to provide a solution for someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw also the intel 3945 ABG wifi adapter under windows 10 can only accept numeric wifi passwords.</p>

                    <p>Dzień dobry,</p>
<p>Moje konto zostało skradzione. (zarówno konto ZeroThyme20752 Xbox oraz Microsoft przypisane do adresu email<strong> [Mod removed-personal information]</strong> z miesięczną subskrypcją konta gold)</p>
<p><span>Najpierw zmieniono hasło, a następnie usunięto (zablokowano). Pojawia się informacja, że wpisuje złe hasło, następne komunikaty uważały konto za nie istniejące. Ok godz 12 dostałem komunikaty z banku o braku możliwości
 zrealizowania&nbsp;</span>transakcji !!!!!!</p>
<p>moje pytania:</p>
<p>1. Jak Państwo chronią dane mojej karty zapisane na tym koncie ?</p>
<p>2. Jak wygląda sprawa z przerwaniem subskrypcji dla tego konta jeżeli nie jest aktywne subskrypcja nie może/powinna być przedłużona?</p>
<p>Dziękuje za odpowiedz</p>
<p>[Translation-Good morning<br />
My account has been stolen. (Both the Xbox ZeroThyme20752 and Microsoft account assigned to your&nbsp;<strong> [Mod removed-personal information]</strong> email address with a monthly gold subscription)<br />
The password was First changed and then removed (blocked). There is a message that the wrong password is entered, the next messages have considered the account to be not existing. Ok 12 o'clock I got messages from the bank about the inability to complete the
 transaction!!!!!!<br />
My questions:<br />
1. How do You protect my card data stored in this account?<br />
2. What is the case with a subscription interruption for this account if there is no active subscription can/should be renewed?<br />
Thank you for your reply</p>

<p>Hi Fellow gamer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with the issue with stolen account. In this case it would be best to first contact your bank about the card on file and let them know what is going on. Second request a call from support to speak with an agent directly in
 this case. You can also look over the guide for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/compromised-account-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
stolen account</a>.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>When you go to </span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Contact Us,</span></span></a><span><span>follow these steps to request a call from support:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 2 ----select see other options then subscription changes</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 3-----select show contact options</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>Step 4 ----select request call from support</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>I'm having this issue too. Tried opening a game that I was successfully playing since the upgrade to Windows 10, but all of a sudden I get the message 'MSVCR100.dll' is missing from the computer. And when I try to download it, it says it's already there.
 The really odd part about this is that I upgraded to Windows 10 and successfully played the game in question since the upgrade. All of a sudden out of the blue, it gives me an error msg. Have tried reinstalling programs but nothing works.

<p>
</p><p>How long have you been around and yet you still cannot get an update to install seamlessly? It really beggars belief!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I now cannot run my AVG virus protection! I need my computer for work, so what do I do now? I have installed further updates to Windows 10 and yet I still get messages that files MSVCP100.dll A, MSCVR100.dll AND MSCVR110.dll are missing. My computer was
 fine running on 8.1 until this update came along. Is this going to be like Vista; another shambles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a professional pilot. If I adopted such a half-hearted approach as Microsoft, what do you think would be the outcome?</p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, there are 2 possible causes why you've encountered this error message.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Incorrect POP3 settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not.
</span></li><li><span>Firewall is blocking the ports (usually port 25) - Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kindly check your POP3 settings, listed below are the information&nbsp;to configure your account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>POP3 Server: <strong><span>pop3.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 995</span></strong>)&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>SMTP Server: <strong><span>smtp.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 25</span></strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Apps not opening or not showing in the task bar alongside microsoft account errors.</h2>
                    I've been having issues all day. Tried to go into my settings to check for updates and I get an error code (0x0) and message stating there is an issue with my Microsoft account (this has happened before but a few dozen restarts fixed it, till now). I've
 tried fixing my account to no avail and now when I open something on my desktop (or from the start menu) either the icon on the task bar isn't underlined with a white line (to show its active) or the icon doesn't show up at all in the task bar.

            Ok, I ran the first troubleshooter and it said that my account password has been changed and it actually has not. The error I got when I went into my settings basically said that my account needed to be fixed before I can get the preview updates again
 and every time I clicked 'Fix Me' I got an error&nbsp;saying that something went wrong and it gave me this error code: 0x0&nbsp;(I also cannot sign into anything that requires my account and password. Windows Store and MSN for example). I ran the Store troubleshooter
 and it fixed everything but the store cache (said it was damaged. Though I finally got that fixed after running the troubleshooter a second time).

            I've just backed my computer up to a previous build (which fixed my Microsoft account issue)&nbsp;but I am still having&nbsp;issues with&nbsp;apps or games not loading. Also, if I have any app updates in the Store they fail to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also seem to have&nbsp;several 'Phantom'
 updates for apps (app icon doesn't show up and it wont update)&nbsp;in my store too.

            The newest windows build fixed most of my issues (Store and app updates as well as MS account issues). Though one minor one still persists, copying anything and then trying to post it in Edge causes the browser to immediately shut down.

<p>
</p><p>As you are still facing an issue with Edge, I suggest you to try the below and check if this helps.</p>

<li>Do you get any error message while using Microsoft Edge?</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>I suggest you clear the <strong>Clear browsing data option </strong>of Microsoft Edge and check if you face the issue. To do so perform the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>More actions</strong> icon next to the feedback icon present on top right corner of the Project Spartan homepage.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Choose what to clear.</strong></li><li>Check the boxes <strong>Browsing history, Cookies and saved website data and Cached data and files
</strong>and click on <strong>Clear.</strong></li></ol>
<p>If issue still persists try method 2</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>

            ok, I cleared everything requested and did the Command Prompt (Administrator) scan. Neither option helped, Edge is still forced to close down as soon as I highlight something to right-click and then post elsewhere.

            <p>Edge is basically just another App so if you can uninstall it and reinstall through the Store it may help.</p>
<p>Many others have had to do a Windows 10 install/upgrade fix when Edge stops functioning correctly by running Windows 10 install media from within Windows and letting it reinstall/fix the Store and OS shell problems.</p>
<p>Or you could just forget Edge and use a better browser like Firefox or Chrome.</p>
