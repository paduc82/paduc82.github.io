<h2>            Windows 7 re-install on Toshiba Laptop - Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : Bob Metzner<br />
<br />
I have an older Toshiba Laptop that came with an OEM version of Windows 7 and I want to do a complete system restore from scratch, which means I will need an Activation Key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, the Windows Sticker on the bottom is SO WORN, I can not read it but I'm sure it's a legitimate license. &nbsp;Is there a utility or a query I can run that will recover the Activation Key from its installed Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm retired and would not like to spend $100 to buy another license when I already own one and just can't read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />
Bob Metzner</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>

                    My Dell Venue 8 Pro has a built in camera and for a while every time I opened it, it blue screened. Now when I open the app, it just says please connect a camera. Attached is a screenshot of what it says when I open the camera. I don't know what to do.
 I tried going into scanners and cameras and adding it&nbsp;and it found nothing. Please help.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdd36bbe-6f37-45c4-b362-6d4b385cc111" />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Could be hardware&nbsp;however Dell as OEM is responsible for the proper&nbsp;operation of <br />
the&nbsp;hardware, their&nbsp;supplied drivers, and&nbsp;Windows. So regardless of the cause it is<br />
theirs&nbsp;to&nbsp;resolve.<br />
<br />
Check with Dell&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board device drivers.&nbsp;Be sure to ASK Dell Support and in their forums because <br />
there are likely to be known&nbsp;issues.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting might help :<br />
<br />
Translate the Windows 7 methods to Windows 8 (there is little difference) :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually
<br />
included with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 apps not working after upgrading to Windows Server 2019</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a customer that upgrade their server from Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2019.</p>
<p>Everything went fine, but then some users start realizing that some Windows apps like the calculator doesn't work. The app open and closes instantly.</p>
<p>I already change one rule in GPO that allows all Windows apps, but this didn't resolve the problem. I also tried resetting the app in users's computer but the problem wasn't solved.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other idea?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store closing immediately after opening</h2>
                    Hello, I was claimed the free copy of Minecraft Windows 10 edition, and to play it the site sent me to the windows store. It opened and immediately closed. I have tried a lot of Powershell commands, wsreset and changing time and date but nothing happened.
 I tried even to reinstall it, but I accidentally deleted it. I made a new user account and it's there but the same problem: Can't open it! Please help! Thanks in advance.

            Hello Vuk,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi Vuk
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Any suggestions as to how to keep contacts in sync across multiple platforms and devices&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Folks, I am at my wit's end here, and what I am asking may not be possible, in which case I will simply keep doing what I am doing...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 PCs, 2 Macs, 2 iPhones, and an iPad in my home.&nbsp; Wow, how far we have come from the old days...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the following email accounts currently in use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hotmail</p>
<p>Gmail (x2)</p>
<p>iCloud (x3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Macs, I use Apple Mail, Address Book, and iCal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the PCs, I use Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iPhone/iPad are simply using the default mail, calendar, and contacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF I don't have access to my own stuff, I use the web interfaces to handle emails.&nbsp; That however is so rare, it is not even worth think about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to make a change anywhere, and have it show up everywhere.&nbsp; Is this a "pipe dream" or can this be accomplished?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideas, thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The accounts <strong>may</strong> be cross/synced if using IMAP but that probably wouldnt include Apple Addreess Books (I dont specifically know since I dont use Apple)</p>

            <p>Oh, I totally agree with you.&nbsp; If it was an easy solution, I wouldn't be here :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider myself a pretty typical home user.&nbsp; I have kids on macs, iPhones, iPads.&nbsp; The "adults" in the family are mostly PC based.&nbsp; Though, we too have iPhones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think what we are looking for is entirely "off-base".&nbsp; I mean, is it really that much to expect that we can have address books and calendars that stay in sync together?&nbsp; If the wife adds something to the calendar, is it so much to ask that the same
 calendar is updated across the board?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if we, the direct family,&nbsp;are all in Hotmail, and we were purely a Windows based family, including with phones, other people in my "in-direct" family should still be able to add or edit events to calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just shouldn't be this complicated...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am all for marketing, and trying to capture the market (the American dream as even Microsoft was a small business once), but either I clearly don't understand something, or this just isn't possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even consider myself pretty tech savvy, I mean, I am in I.T. after all...&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, is THIS why "CardDAV" and "CalDAV" are coming online?&nbsp; Is THAT the solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just looking for ideas and thoughts as to how to attack this, and as I said before, perhaps it is just expecting too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be assured that we will do our best to help you.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party antivirus software</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><span>: As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2: Sign out of your account</span></strong><span>.<strong>
</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Some problems can be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>To do so, press <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Delete
</strong>and select </span><span><strong>Sign out</strong></span><span>. Once you‚Äôve signed out, sign back in to your account and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong><span>: <strong>
Check for updates.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo</strong> key +R, enter <strong>ms-settings:</strong> and then press
<strong>OK</strong>. This opens Settings.</span></li><li><span>In Settings, go to <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>, and then select
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. Install any available updates and restart your PC if required.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: If you are still facing the issue, try creating a new local administrator account and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows logo key +R, type <strong>ms-settings:</strong>, and then press
<strong>OK</strong>. This opens Settings. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Your account</strong> &gt;
<strong>Family &amp; other users</strong> (or <strong>Other users</strong>, if you‚Äôre using Windows&nbsp;10 Enterprise).</span></span></li><li><span><span>Under <strong>Other users</strong>, select <strong>Add someone else to this PC</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>I don‚Äôt have this person‚Äôs sign-in information</strong>, and then select
<strong>Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong>. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Set a user name, password, and password hint. Then select <strong>
Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Finish</strong>. </span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Next, make the new account an administrator account.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Under <strong>Other users</strong>, choose the account you created, and then select
<strong>Change account type</strong>. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Under <strong>Account type</strong>, choose <strong>Administrator</strong>, and then select

            <span>Hello Kam LamChow,</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the delay in response.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might have occurred due to corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Let us run
<strong>SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The
<strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Press
<strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>keys. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click on
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong><span>: Click
<strong>Yes</strong> if it prompts for permission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the
<strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>key on the keyboard.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>At the command prompt window, type the following commands:</span></li><li>
<span>Press the Enter key after each command:&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type
<strong>Exit</strong>, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            license transfer problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Last day I download WWE 13 from my friend's account in my xbox and I try to play... but the game doesn't work, so I transfered the license to my xbox and I retry but the xbox gave me the same error.</p>
<p>today I called the xbox support and they told me that I can't play this game... but my friend can play &nbsp;games that I have on my account on their xbox.</p>

<p>I hope you can help me with this problem</p>

<p>p.s: sorry for my English but I'm Italian</p>

<p>What your trying to do is classed as marketplace theft &amp; a bannable offence.As it's against the terms &amp; conditions it can't be discussed on the forums.</p>

<p>In short your friend owns the game so by transferring it would be as if his account is now on you console so he can carry on as normal. For DRM reasons only one account can take ownership of a downloaded game etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be unable to play using your account as the downloaded game will be linked to your friend‚Äôs account etc. as will the licence for the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your friend would then be unable to play the game at home as he would have transferred his licence i.e. as if your console is now his. He would need to wait 4 months to transfer the content back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to play the game on your console using your account you will need to purchase the game to receive a licence yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will probably explain better than I can: support.xbox.com/.../download-content</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As above you need to be really careful with this type of situation as you do not want to breach the DRM rules etc. as you could both be banned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best bet is buy the game yourself or give multiplayer a go on your friends machine.</p>

    <title>Windows Update trying to install drivers for non-existent devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kikill3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update trying to install drivers for non-existent devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>currently I have Windows 10 installed on an external SSD connected to my MacBook Pro, kinda like a Windows-To-Go installation.</p>
<p>I've recently booted up the system on another PC for just a couple of minutes so there wasn't enough time for the system to install drivers.</p>
<p>Then I booted it back on my MacBook again, and now Windows Update is desperately trying to install the drivers for some HID-Devices, the trackpad and the integrated Intel HD4000 graphics of the other PC onto my Mac, which fails of course.
</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to clear out Windows Update and make it realize that these devices don't exist on my Mac. I've attempted to delete the Downloads folder in SoftwareDistribution and then restarting the WU service, I've tried deleting temporary files in disk
 cleanup too, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in solving this would be greatly appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p>Also: The devices don't even show up in Device Manager.<br />
</p>

            Hi  Kikill3r
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would try to block the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            As I said clicking on the Trustdevice page just sends me into an endless loop so I think Microsoft have got the wrong link embedded in the page.
<div><br />
<div>However I have got my sync working by activating a couple of syncing options in PC Settings I hadn't noticed before. I also found it helps by setting up my Microsoft Account as a separate Mail Account under Mail and syncing it. The email then comes flooding
 into the Microsoft Account as well as my GMail Account which is set up as a Local Account (but not always the same email). &nbsp;I am not sure if this makes my Mail app vulnerable to hacking but it seems to work?</div>

                    <p>Hi! I'm having an issue on my windows 10 HP computer. I don't know if I have a malware, or a virus or whatever. But one day I log on my computer and suddenly none of my desktop files' names are appearing. Neither my right-clic settings, control panel nor
 task manager display any text whatsoever. Home button, cortana and even pc personalization and pc settings from windows 10 do show text, but apparently any selectable text seems so be appearing. Also my Firefox explorer and any app I try to open run really
 slow. Please I need help ASAP. </p>
<p>Thanks in advanced to everyone.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System Builder License - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miket.  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Builder License</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased Windows 7 Professional OEM System Builder from a retail store. In order to buy it they required that I purchase an internal hardware component. (I'm building a new computer with all new parts.)<br />
<br />
Later on I read the following on the packaging:<br />
<br />
<strong>If you open this package:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li>Each individual software license inside this package may ONLY be distributed with a fully assembled computer system.
</li><li>If the individual software license is for a desktop operating system or application software, it also must be preinstalled on the hard drive of the fully assembled computer system, using the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK).
</li></ul>
--<br />
<br />
I've read a few times on these forums that it is OK to use the OEM System Builder Pack. Is this true?<br />
<br />
I read in the license that they can distribute the "Hardware unit" (any Software and end user documentation that may be included in the Pack.) with either a "Customer System" (fully assembled computer system), or with another non-Microsoft computer hardware
 component.<br />
<br />
The term distribute is defined as the time when a Customer System leaves their control. I didn't purchase a Customer System - so is it or is it not OK to use and install this software?<br />
<br />
I'm kind of confused by the logic of this license. Any help to sort through this would be appreciated :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike

            You are the System Builder as you are building your own PC.<br />
You are also the r<span>ecipient.<br />
<br />
So yes you can install the OEM copy. However be aware of the fact that should the motherboard fail you OEM version of Windows 7 is now worthless as it can not be installed on another PC. If you buy a replacement motherboard it must be an "exact" duplicate (one
 small change by the motherboard manufacture)&nbsp;or the replacement motherboard (even though it may have the same part number ) and you will not be able to re-activate Windows 7.<br />

<br />
I don't think that is correct. AFAIK it is up to the OEM Vendor (the builder) on how they determine what constitutes a "new" computer.<br />
<br />
And if you go here,<br />

<br />
there is only ONE mention of motherboard, in the first clause which says:<br />
<span><span>
<p>a. ‚ÄúCustomer System‚Äù means a fully assembled computer system that includes a CPU, a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">motherboard</span></strong>, a power supply, an</p>
<p>internally mounted NAND or revolving magnetic-based hard drive, and a case. For Server products, a hard drive and separate</p>
<p>power supply are not required. A Customer System must meet the system requirements of the software as posted on</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com and must be able to run the Software.</p>
</span></span><br />
That's the ONLY mention of motherboard in the whole licence.<br />

            Well all I can tell you is that I've changed power supplies, Graphics cards, CPU, memory, hard drives (not all at the same time) and never had an issue. However changing the Network card triggered the need to re-activate. A for motherboards that a given
 that re-activation will be required even on retail versions.<br />

Oh yes, re-activation, sure. That's no problem......<br />
Sorry, I thought you said that you COULDN'T re-activate if the motherboard was changed...

            That's what I said, if you have an OEM copy and you change the motherboard that OEM product key will not work!<br />

<strong><br />
<br />
Q.</strong> <span>Can a PC with an OEM Windows operating system have its motherboard upgraded and keep the same license? What if it was replaced because it was defective?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer‚Äîexcept the motherboard‚Äîand still retain the license for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the motherboard is upgraded or
 replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the license of new operating system software is required. If the motherboard is replaced
 because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>The reason for this licensing rule primarily relates to the End User Software License Terms and the support of the software covered by that End User Software License Terms. The End User Software License Terms is a set of usage rights granted to the end user
 by the PC manufacturer and relates only to rights for that software as installed on that particular PC. The system builder is required to support the software on the original PC. Understanding that end users, over time, upgrade their PCs with different components,
 Microsoft needed to have one base component "left standing" that would still define the original PC. Since the motherboard contains the CPU and is the "heart and soul" of the PC, when the motherboard is replaced (for reasons other than defect) a new PC is
 essentially created. The original system builder did not manufacture this new PC, and therefore cannot be expected to support it</p>

            Good find Mike,<br />
<br />
I'm no lawyer but have handled a number of Military contracts. The word "intent" is not very strong. If it&nbsp;was worded as "Shall" then there would be not question.<br />
<br />
That said, in my opinion anything posted on a web site can not be considered legal and binding as the next time you click on the link the page and words contains therein could have been changed.<br />
<br />
I would be more interested in the licence file and what it contains. If there are any links within the licence file like there are in the retail version then I think the whole EULA would not hold up in court possibly. Again this is my opinion, I don't even
 believe a Microsoft lawyer or group of independets could all come to the same interpretation.<br />
<br />
"If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model
<strong>or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent</strong>, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty." This does allow for some wiggle room.<br />
<br />
When I get a chance I'll have a closer look at the license file.<br />

<p>From what I can tell, it's okay to use it if you're building a computer for a customer, a computer for which you intend to provide some support. Anything else requires the retail version. I'm not too happy about this, since it's about to cost me $100 more,
 but there it is.</p>

You can also use it if you build the computer for yourself.<br />
<br />
However, be aware of the biggest disadvantage of an OEM version: its<br />
license ties it permanently to the first computer it's installed on.<br />
It can never legally be moved to another computer, sold, or given away<br />
(except with the original computer). If the computer dies or is<br />
stolen, your license dies with it. <br />

                    I've been unable (after multiple attempts) to install iCloud.com on my Windows 10 PC, 64-bit, 2 GB Ram, 500 GB HD w/250 GB free.&nbsp; I downloaded the iCloud *.exe install program and Ran it.&nbsp; Part way through the install process, an error box appears saying,
 "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.&nbsp; A&nbsp;program required for this install to complete could not be run.&nbsp; Contact your support personnel or package vendor."&nbsp; I've tried a half dozen tips to try to get it to work, including running System
