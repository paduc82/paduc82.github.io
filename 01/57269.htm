    <title>Hard drive not showing up in Win7 setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r.a.jolls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive not showing up in Win7 setup</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having trouble installing Windows 7 on my hard drive. I previously had a RAID 0 setup, but one of the drives crashed. I decided to use the remaining drive as my Windows (and scratch)&nbsp;drive and build a RAID 5 setup for everything else. My problem is that
 Windows Setup cannot detect the previous RAID drive. Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p>Loaded drivers for Intel SATA controller - no drive shown.</p>
<p>Connected OLD drive to Marvell SATA3 controller, loaded drivers during Win7 setup - no drive shown.</p>
<p>Connected NEW drive (going to be used for RAID setup) and installed Win7.</p>
<p>Installed Marvell SATA3 drivers, entered Disk Management - OLD drive shown.</p>
<p>Formatted OLD drive and set Active - shows Healthy, Primary partition.</p>
<p>Rebooted, Win7 setup still does not show OLD drive, even with Marvell SATA3 drivers loaded.</p>
<p>Tried Recovery console, cannot find drive.</p>
<p>So why can Windows see the drive in Disk Management but not see it during Setup? From some research I've done, it seems the MBR may be messed up? Since there is not a previous Windows installation on the drive (well, only half of one), I can't use Recovery
 Console...</p>
<p>HELP!</p>

            Its generally because you may need to install the sata controler driver via usb early during the win 7 installation, depending on how your sata/controller drives are configured in the bios and which sata connector its on

<h2>            Gears of War 2 disconnects my Xbox One and Xbox 360 from Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem where Gears of war 2 multiplayer constantly disconnects me from Xbox Live. It
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> happens when I play Gears of War 2 multiplayer.</p>
<p>I have only had this problem for about 3 weeks and it is becoming more frequent. (I literally get disconnected every 5 minutes)</p>
<p>Below is text from an email I sent Xbox Support who have been trying to help for a week now. They have been polite and helpful, but unable to fix the issue at all.</p>
<p>My apologies, as the text makes it obvious that I am angry, but if anyone knows why this game is *** my connection any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">"Just to let you know. I made sure to open all of the suggested ports and reset my NAT table as you suggested.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I was able to find a game on my Xbox 360 in Gears of War 2. I stayed in the lobby for 3 games and then was promptly disconnected from Xbox Live. I
 was unable to reconnect with gears 2 open, however, if I went back to the dash I would be automatically reconnected. On occasion if I then reloaded Gears 2 I would get disconnected from Live again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">After my first disconnect, I was unable to stay in any game for the duration of the game.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Now I load Gears 2, search, find a game, get disconnected from Xbox Live, go to dash, sign back in, reload gears and so on without ever being able
 to finish a game.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Gears of War 2 keeps kicking me from Live on my 360 and my Xbox One is even worse. I still can’t even find a game on my Xbox One.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Either the gears servers are junk or my Xbox One is junk, because I literally am signed out every time I load that game ………and I am sick of it! I am
 over it, and something needs to happen, I cannot keep paying for a service I don’t receive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">This is not your fault but I hope you can pass on my disgust at the money I waste on hardware, games and Live now, when I have had more than 10 years
 of no trouble. What is wrong and why can’t it be fixed?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I feel like I should start to get some compensation for the lost time I waste pressing A to reconnect to Xbox Live to have my console tell me “your
 console cannot connect to Xbox Live” …… until I exit from Gears of War 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Please know I will post this email in a Xbox forum in case there is someone who knows why I cannot play this game online."</span></p>

<p>If I understand you have an Xbox One and an Xbox 360 connected to your network.</p>
<p>Test activate the DMZ on your router with the IP of your Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to open the NAT table for both consoles.</p>

<p><br />
If you have connected the printer via USB and installed the latest Windows Vista software direct from Brother's web page&nbsp;and that failed - it's NOT a

&nbsp; <br />
You have done that?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that&nbsp;Windows 10 does recognize and&nbsp;display a prompt when earphones are plugged in. I&nbsp;would like to ask if&nbsp;you are able to listen to sound from the earphone when plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” on the search bar and press Enter.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on “<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>”.</span></li><li>
<span>A pop-up will appear, click on the “<strong>Next</strong>” button and your hardware troubleshooting will&nbsp;start.</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope the information is helpful.

    <title>Xbox One internet connectivity issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theconcertguru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One internet connectivity issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my Xbox One S was working fine, as usual. When I woke up today I was having a very unusual internet connectivity issue. My Xbox believes it is successfully connected to the internet (running a network connection test returns the result that I'm
 connected, wired), but no app (Netflix/Twitch/YouTube) or game I try to play will function because they claim I have no internet connection. In addition to this, the home screen still displays the "Connect to Xbox Live" button, and my friends list is perpetually
 locked showing the same 5 friends online playing the same games for hours (even though I've confirmed they aren't online and other friends not shown are). Also, navigating any menus, including system settings, was very laggy/unresponsive and occasionally would
 freeze up until I went to the home screen and closed the Settings app to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I tried power cycling my modem, router and Xbox, as per the usual recommended steps. After attempting that twice, I tried clearing my console's persistent storage and alternate MAC address and power cycling again. Still nothing. My other game consoles/computer/phone
 are all connecting to my network/internet with no issue. Finally, I decided to factory reset my console, hoping a clean wipe would get me somewhere. Nope. Wired as usual, the console successfully passes the network test, but fails to get any update information.
 The error code it gives me isn't on Microsoft's website of listed codes, either, so I go for updating the console offline (error code: 0x8B0500B6 0x00000000 0x00000201. I tried searching just the 8B0500B6 part as recommended). I successfully download the file
 and update my console through troubleshooting mode, which then brings me back to the reset point I was at, where it continues to check for updates and get this error message forever. I'm stuck and I need help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can offer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-TheConcertGuru</p>

<p>Hi The ConcertGuru,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, are you part of Xbox Insider program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, have you check Xbox Live status&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if nothing is wrong with Xbox Live I recommend you requesting a call back because it seems like you did everything anyone on this forum would advise you to do&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/</a>.

Windows Essentials</a> which can be loaded on Windows 10. As far as I know, Microsoft has no immediate plans to create a different version for Windows 10.

            I have tried using the Windows 10 version of Movie Maker included with the Essentials packet. &nbsp;It doesn't work. &nbsp;After tweeking the sound with the video, and then saving, it's off by about 3 seconds. &nbsp;I tried to save it to my computer instead of just saving
 the raw movie and it's even worse. &nbsp;Then I put the raw on a thumb drive and tried to download it to an XP and Windows 7 computer and it is not compatible. &nbsp;I have done everything to make this work and it just won't. &nbsp;One more reason to ditch Windows 10

            I agree I am so frustrated......I think it stinks that they did not include it on 10 what good is windows 10 in this day and age without a good dependable quality Movie Maker which is not at all complicated to figure out how to use it.

<h2>            Windows 10 login problems</h2>
                    <p>After yesterday's update I have run into issues logging into my computer.&nbsp; The first several times I tried to turn it on, it would be very laggy in recognizing input from my KB+M (I would type or click and it would register all at once 45 seconds later).&nbsp;
 Eventually this stopped happening and I tried to reset and login several times, all successfully.&nbsp; However, now when I type my password to log in, the circle spins for 3-4 minutes and it shoots me back to the login screen.&nbsp; When I try again it loads immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that this is a software issue, since this is all relatively new hardware that has worked flawlessly for the past 6 months since I built it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />

            Hello,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />When you cannot connect to Windows, there are two different situations.
<br />
<br />1- If your connexion account is a Microsoft account, you can reset the password on login screen. 
<br />
<br />2- If your only connexion account is a local account, the easiest solution is to reset the PC with option remove everything, necessary option when you have no password.
<br />
<br /> You can get to reset by restarting your PC from the sign-in screen. Press the Windows logo key  +L to get to the sign-in screen, and then hold the Shift key while you select Power  &gt; Restart in the lower-right corner of the screen. After your PC restarts, select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC.
<br />Then choose the option Remove everything.

            Hey Hey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this. First try whichever method works here: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable</a>...
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>.... Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only.
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor</a>...
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, or on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a</a>...
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Adding user restrictions - WIndows 7 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding user restrictions - WIndows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    Hi all, <br />
<br />
I had a quick questions on how to restrict user from adding icons or changing the desktop. The main Administrator account on the computer is not active and there is only one user account with Administrator privileges.
<br />
<br />
The computer is running Windows 7 Home Premium. I've searched around a bit and it seemed like all the answer had something to do with opening Group Policy which isn't available on Home Premium.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ranaz1<br />

</p><p>I guess that proves it is the primary alright.&nbsp; Otherwise symptoms like yours make me think the user is looking at a secondary.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g., then the user always says that the Start button is "not working".&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what does Win-P, CursorUp, Enter do anyway?</p>

<h2>            Microphone on headset is not working on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>*Original&nbsp;Title: <strong>Microphone/headset not working, they fail on windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well here is what is happening i had my headset working and microphone (in the headset) working perfectly fine. Then i unplugged them to tidy things up then re-plugged them back in and now i can only get the sound to work which worlds perfectly but the microphone
 doesn't. I'm pretty sure I have downloaded all drivers needed and the microphone isn't muted. Everything is fine when i check if the microphone is working it shows its fine but when I speak you cant see the sound bar go up and no one can hear me. I don't know
 why its suddenly doing this it never done this before and never done any other OS only Windows 8.1 I have seen many others having similar problems or this same one but yet none have got the answers they need to fix it. So i would be very happy to find out
 how to get it working. Thank you in advance!:) </p>

<p>Is there a way to see who viewed your profile? Like on a 3rd party site? It is possible to view your rep on a 3rd party site so why wouldn't this be possible? I think someone is stalking me so if anyone knows a site, please help me.</p>

<p>No, that will most likely never be possible. Looking at someone's profile will only be visible you, and will no way notify them that you gave viewed it unless any interactions wad initiated your end such as adding them ad a friend, private/party invited
 which also can be done without looking at the profile, but if its just profile browsing without any invites you will be basically anonymous. I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

 cleaners excel at scaring the living daylight out of people with fictitious error messages. If you are lucky then they have no effect on the performance of your machine. If you're unlucky then they damage or wreck Windows.</p>
<p>If you installed the cleaner last Sunday (24 October) then the registry backup file dated 29 October is already damaged. I can see two options for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the disk diagnostic test that Andre Ziegler recommends. </li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD, then perform a System Restore to go back by a week.</li></ul>

            you never had control, you only thought you did but just like in win10, win7 had just as much you couldnt control or access. The average consumer doesn't even know that there is an Administrator account that can be unlocked which would had more authority
 than the average user that borrows priviligas from the Administrator account to do things. I agree that things like cortana should be able to be turned off and its unfortunate that only people like me know how to do it because even the Administrator account
 does not give you absolute root power. There is a reason for this, if everyone was able to go anywhere and do anything in the OS then MS would drown in people breaking their systems by messing with things they shouldn't. On my system i wrote a Pshell script
 that removes all the things i do not want in windows 10{such as cortana}. When i am done fully testing it in Virtual Machines I will give it away. Microsoft is the middle ground, at least they release their productivity apps like MS offic

            <p>I understand exactly what you are saying although I'm not looking for root access and neither should most normal users. However The simple fact that forcing bloatware under the excuse that it is part of the OS onto users is absurd. and not allowing me to
 remove what ever I wish is crazy especially when I will never use it, I get that there are ways around this by using Power shell scripts but it shouldn't come to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I fail to understand your reply and why you even made it. I'm not asking for total control in the sense of which you speak I know what that entails, and I'm sure you understood what I meant.&nbsp; Maybe my use of the word Entirety was to much even
 so my point stands, You suck Microsoft. I don't own a four thousand dollar pc to put linux on it. And sense Windows is literally the only for the most part hassle free OS when it comes to plug and play, I'm stuck with it, I don't have the time to learn power
 shell, Apple is garbage, Linux works but I don't have time for that either. I understand I sound entitled but without my feedback nor the feedback of many nothing would change, I'm just here to voice that opinion in hope of an answer or even a change in the
 future, at least I gave it a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closing the only thing I found of value in your reply is the fact that people like you who do understand such things are being proactive and doing something to help the masses with such scripts, I applaud you for doing what Microsoft should have done
 from the start. </p>

<h2>            I can&#8217;t play my games with gold event though I have an active Xbox live membership.</h2>
                    I have downloaded Battlefield 1 with the games with gold function and then it worked perfectly. But when I now a few months later try to play it again it says that I need to renew my xbox live membership (and gives me the error code 0x803f800f ) even though
 I have an active one. I have tried searching up the error code but the information didn’t help, I have switched to all my accounts on my xbox to see if it was downloaded elsewhere but it wasn’t. Does anyone know how to solve this problem or does anyone else
 have it?

            Free play days are different than Games with Gold games. You can only play the games for free during those free play days. In order to continue playing, you have to purchase the game. Battlefield was part of Games with Gold in November 2018, but has also
 had free play days since then.&nbsp;

    <title>Solution for Surface Book 2 unable to turn using Power Button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmewong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solution for Surface Book 2 unable to turn using Power Button</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>There was a Windows update on my SB2 on Thursday 13/9 and the following day, the same symptom unable to power up using the button occurred again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instruction I posted few months ago and fortunately solved the problem. Seems like this problem is still intermittent and Microsoft didn't fix this permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm posting this again as I believe, there will be more people facing this issue and looking for solution. I'm not so sure whether these are the right procedures but it works!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download latest Surface Book 2 firmware from here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023482</p>
<p>There are 4 files to choose from. I selected <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
SurfaceBook2_Win10_17134_1802209_1.msi</span>&nbsp;assuming this is the latest version number. Mine is 15" SB2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Double click the file downloaded. During installation, prompted option to Change, Repair and Remove. Only Remove option is available to be selected. Removed previous firmware installation and after that run the downloaded firmware again. This
 time the installation just proceed without prompting for Change, Repair and Remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After install and restart with the new firmware, Surface Book 2 able to turn on as normal by pressing the power button once. However, there is another problem occurred; Detach icon is in RED with X and stated "Harware Failure". Previously I'm able
 to detach the screen with keyboard Detach button but this time I'm unable to do that. Reboot few times....RED icon still appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;<span>Force restart solved the Detach RED icon issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform force restart:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Hold the Power button for 30 seconds and then,</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp; continuing to hold down power, press the volume up side of the volume button for 15 seconds.</p>
<p>iii. You will see some unfamiliar Surface Setup Page. Don't change anything.</p>
<p>iv. Select exit and save the setting.</p>
<p>v. Once Windows 10 restart, Detach icon become normal.</p>
                </div>

            Здравствуйте. Проблема с видеокартой Нвидиа или ее драйвером. Если переустановка с сайта  не поможет, тогда проблема аппаратная, к сожалению.
<br /><a href="https://www.nvidia.ru/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=ru" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.nvidia.ru/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=ru</a> отсюда можно скачать драйвер. При установке выберите Ручной или Выборочный режим и установите галочку на пункте Чистая установка

<h2>            Slow boot up, how to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>After receiving an update in late march of this year 2016, My computer now takes 30 minutes to boot up. It used to take less than 45 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 in December 2015 from windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the details of my error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I hit the power button</p>
<p>2. My OEM's logo/loading screen pops up for a couple milliseconds (this is normal for Dell PCs)</p>
<p>3. The black screen with the blue windows logo with the white circles comes up. The white circle animation plays as normal for approximately 25-35 seconds before cutting to black</p>
<p>4. The black screen with the blue windows logo &amp; white circles reappears but the animation is playing very slowly (1/10th speed)</p>
<p>5. This animation continues to play for 30 minutes</p>
<p>6. The cover page appears (with the system time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did notice that if I interrupted the boot process during steps 4 or 5 by holding down the power button on my PC for 5 seconds, the computer would boot up like it used to before the update the next time I turned it on. To clarify, here is how i've been
 getting around it (starting from the beginning with my computer off):</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. I hit the power button</p>
<p>2. My OEM's logo/loading screen pops up for a couple milliseconds (this is normal for Dell PCs)</p>
<p>3. The black screen with the blue windows logo with the white circles comes up. The white circle animation plays as normal for approximately 25-35 seconds before cutting to black</p>
<p>4. The black screen with the blue windows logo &amp; white circles reappears but the animation is playing very slowly (1/10th speed)</p>
<p>5. I wait anywhere from 3 - 200 seconds</p>
<p>6. I hold down the power button on my PC for 10 seconds</p>
<p>7. I release the power button</p>
<p>8. I press the power button (and release it) thereby turning it on</p>
<p>9. The OEM logo screen appears</p>
<p>10. The windows logo animation loading screen appears</p>
<p>11. 20 seconds pass and the computer turns on</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can imagine, my workaround has been causing a lot of system instability and a lot of fragmentation on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my graphics &amp; sound drivers since then, and the problem has not stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what is most likely causing the problem, and how can I fix it?</p>
