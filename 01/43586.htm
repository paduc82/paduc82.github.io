<h2>            Game tiles not showing up in &#38;&#35;39&#59;My Games&#38;&#35;39&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>ive noticed on my Xbox 360 the past few weeks that a lot of games aren't showing up the box art in the my games section. I've tried deleting and redownloading the titles and doing a license transfer but no luck. wondered if anyone knows a fix or way around
 this? Not a big problem, just annoying.</p>
<p>The tiles are showing up as a white Xbox live logo rather than the box art.</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi, at the moment, it seems to be affecting a lot of users. &nbsp;It's actually an Xbox Live issue that causes this problem. &nbsp;There is nothing that can be done, but wait until Microsoft fix it.</p>

<h2>            Microphone Problem</h2>
                    My Macbook Pro suddenly lost my Skype mic. It works fine on everything else. It's activated in Skype settings but no sound is detected.

            If you are on Mojave, below is the fix for this - Can you try going to System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; privacy &gt; Microphone &gt; And see whether Skype is checked or not. 
<br />
<br />If not checked, check it and click the lock to make the changes.
<br />
<br />If this is already checked, uncheck it, click the lock to make the changes. Check it again and click the lock to make the changes.

<h2>            Headphones not detected&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried for several hours to fix this problem, but in vain.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't my headphones, since they work completely fine otherwise. The problem is my laptop. I think that my laptop doesn't detect the headphones, since when I look in the control panel I can only see the speaker icon (despite also having filled in
 the 'show disabled/disconnected devices'), even when the headphones are in.<br />
<br />
I have also looked at the device manager, and then I can see something called 'high definition audio device' and 'intel(r) display audio'. I don't know if the first one maybe is the audio driver? I have tried to update it but it says it is up to date. I have
 also tried to install realtek audio but it doesn't work. When I try to uninstall my audio-thingy it always comes back when I've restarted my laptop.<br />
<br />
Whatever it is, it's not working. What should I do? I feel completely lost.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a windows 7.&nbsp;

                    EDIT: All other problems have gone!<br />
<br />
Ok, so I had something wrong with my laptop a few days ago and have managed to fix most of them through Refreshing my PC, Unlocking my Local Disk etc. and now there is one problem left.<br />
<br />
When the PC Settings are launched I get: http://i47.tinypic.com/2zokw7b.png before it goes back to the Start Screen. The same for the App Store but a different image.<br />
<br />
Don't know whats wrong and am looking for a fix!<br />

<h2>            Help - can&#39;t see my old emails in my inbox&#33;</h2>
                    hi there<br />
<br />
Up until yesterday lunchtime my email inbox on Windows Mail (I have Vista) showed my old emails as well as my new mails. then suddenly all my old emails disappeared and I can only see new emails from yesterday lunchtime!!<br />
<br />
Help!! my emails have vanished - how do I get them back?<br />
<br />
I use AOL - when I check my AOL via webmail i can still see the old emails so know they exist.&nbsp; so why have they disappeard from Windows Mail?<br />
<br />
I have several folders set up on my AOL Windows Mail accont so don't want to have to set&nbsp;up a new windows mail account as I will lose allmy folders. And my account settings are set to "view all mail".<br />
<br />
even wehn I press "send&nbsp;&amp; receive" none of my old inbox emails are being shown up.<br />
<br />
thanks regards<br />
<br />
<br />

did you get my last comment?&nbsp; You may be too busy to respond.&nbsp; Here it is again:<br />

I am running Bitdefender and I really love it.&nbsp; It's not that at all in my opinion, but thanks anyway.&nbsp; I hit a SPAM button while wanting to put an email from CLASSMATES in there and ALL just vanished.&nbsp; IF you can tell me in very simple terms what to do, I
 would certainly appreciate you.&nbsp; Thanks again,&nbsp;

<br />
1. Since you saw them in AOL website, why don't you go back there, pick one and Forward it 1back to you.<br />
When you receive it, see what happens after you have&nbsp;read it.<br />
<br />
2. You used different treminology....." my account settings are set to "<strong>view all mail</strong>".<br />
Does that mean you have set it to " <strong>show all messages " ?<br />
Open Windows Mail &gt; View &gt; Current View &gt; Show all messages<br />

I've ran the compatibility troubleshooter and tried everything in it... nothing works... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated...<br />

No error messages... just black screen... until I hit next in the compatibility troubleshooter... then it shuts down and sends something to MS...

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>That game that you are trying to play has no information in the compatibility center for Windows 7. As you have already tried the compatibility troubleshooter
 to install the game, now you may try to install Windows XP mode on your computer and then install the game in Windows XP mode and check if that helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Just purchased a new system with Windows 7.&nbsp; It's useless. I am shocked and dismayed that Microsoft would market a software that would make vitually all our previously purchased games and other programs non-useable.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Some of these are quite classic titles -- I hope the backlash grows as this bespeaks a certain lack of grounding on microsoft's part.... what did they think people would do???<br />

            WBC3 worked great with Windows XP Pro... but, I couldn't get it to work in Vista Ultimate... it is a great shame, because it's a great game...
<br />
<br />
I would like to get it working in Windows 7... I've tried the compatibility wizard with all it's settings but it won't work... The demo plays... but, the real version won't play... something about it not wanting to run with a debugger loaded into memory...
<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help that anyone has to offer...

 setup file must be downloaded and installed for this feature to work" When I download the file it tells me &nbsp;"Update for Windows(KB8977206) is already installed on this computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 then select All Programs &gt; Windows Virtual PC &gt; Windows XP Mode to begin setup.

<p>I'm just writing to follow up that I did eventually figure out how to get WindowsXP mode to install on Windows 7, but warlords battlecry III and games in general *do not* work in this virtual environment, given that this mode seems to be intended for legacy
 business software and the like. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What *did work* was going with an open source option: Virtual Box. &nbsp;After loading windows xp and enabling 3d acceleration in the Virtual Box settings, I'm now able to play Warlords Battle Cry 3 in a virtual Windows XP environment on Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Any chance&nbsp;someone could give me a 'walkthrough' of how to do what you did? I'm no computer genius. I have the same problem - WBC3 won't run on my brand new laptop cos it has Windows 7. I've already downloaded Windows Virtual PC with XP Mode, and also got
 Virtual Box. But I don't really know where to go from there! Whenever I try I keep getting the same message:&nbsp;<strong>FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.</strong></p>
<p>Let it just be said that I suck with technical stuff. Please someone help me out! Although, bear with me, because I probably won't understand unless it's a<em> very</em>in-depth description!</p>

            I recently installed Windows7 on my Mac via Bootcamp, and was excited to find that WBC2 worked fine on my machine. When I tried installing WBC3, however, I ran into similar issues.
<br />
<br />
Rather than downloading windows XP mode or installing XP on a virtual machine, I found another solution. I ran the Program Compatibility Wizard (accessed through Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Programs)&nbsp; and chose "Not Listed". Then choose Browse, and target
 the autorun file on the WBC3 CD. Hope this is helpful to some of you, I found this to be a more comfortable work-around for now.
<br />
<br />
I played through the first level of the campaign just to make sure it works. So far, so good.<br />

            I'm with McLaren on this one... I'd LOVE a walkthrough... <br />
<br />
I've tried using VBOx... I LOVE Virutal Box... but, when I try to install and run WBC3 it objects to the debugger... It says that there is a debugger in the background and it won't work...
<br />
<br />
How do U get by that???<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business &#40;O365&#41; keeps popping up and stealing focus...</h2>
                    <p>New install of O365 (E3). Everything seems to be working, EXCECPT that Skype for Business keeps popping up and stealing focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly related to other O365 apps -- looking at Systinternal I can see that the other O365 app is launching lync.exe process (as a subprocess to winword for example). That subprocess dies, after bringing the real lync.exe process to the front and giving
 it focus.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my analysis, this issue could be related to the settings of the Windows System. Would you please try the followings to see how it goes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Right click a Word file in your computer, in the dropdown list click the option Open with, in the “How do you want to open this file?” window, choose Word and check the option Always use this app to open .docx files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/866d227f-c612-49e4-ae2b-08acde145091?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/866d227f-c612-49e4-ae2b-08acde145091?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2. Search default app settings in the search box of the Windows, and then navigate to Default apps&gt; Choose default apps by file type, make sure the .doc .dochtml ect are opened by Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a6edc6c-ac62-407b-a9da-9810f1b7d0cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a6edc6c-ac62-407b-a9da-9810f1b7d0cc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;3. If you are using an Office 365 account, please download and try to fix the issue with the tool Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 via the following link:</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, but none of those items fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, this is happening to 3 out of the users&nbsp;where I've installed O365 (we are&nbsp;in the&nbsp;process of converting to O365).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word (and all the Office programs) work completely correctly -- all files open in the right application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that if Skype for Business is running, while I'm in another Office Application (like Word) the Skype App will pop up and steal focus. It mostly happens when I click on an Office menu item, but it can happen if I'm just typing normally into a
 Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried "Web repair" of Office, removing all other applications, turning off antivirus, and nothing works. I've looked in the event log and didn't see anything related. Nothing obvious in the Skype log.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification. I did further investigation, and I find that the issue may be caused by the settings or caches of Skype for Business. Would you mind doing the following steps to see how it goes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Navigate to Settings (shown as a gear)&gt; Personal and then uncheck the option Start the app in the foreground.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c788dd4b-c85c-46bc-afe9-093f3548859e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c788dd4b-c85c-46bc-afe9-093f3548859e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Clear the cache as follows:</p>
<p><span>1)Please right click the&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;icon and open the&nbsp;Run&nbsp;bar.</span></p>
<p><span>2)Then type in:&nbsp;<em>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\&nbsp;</em>folder.</span></p>
<p><span>3)Delete the sip profile folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4)Go into the&nbsp;<strong>Tracing</strong>&nbsp;folder, delete all files, but not the folders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Coldwell</span></p>

<p>I've tried the various option on skype. I also tried using the complete Office remover and reinstalled O365, as well as turning of antivirus. All with no success.</p>

<p>Symptoms are running Skype as a different user (either regular user or admin) solves the problem (but only sort of). If I run Skype as a different user it works fine, but if I run
<strong>both</strong> Skype and another Office 365 App (e.g., Word) as the different user the problem reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on prelim information, it appears that deleting the user's profile and recreating it solves the issue but will wait to hear from the user this morning.</p>

            I've ended just rebuilding the profiles for the affected users. It happens on about 1 out of 8 or so of our users. Nothing obvious causing it -- some coming for O2010, other O2013. It's probably some remnant registry or folder, but too hard to figure out.&nbsp;

                    I have encrypted one of the drives(not OS drive) using BitLocker successfully. But it is not prompting for password to access that drive. I want it to ask for password every time so that anyone else other than me can't access it. How can I do so?

                    &nbsp;Icon says to click for info to fix. I see NO error codes. Have run various MS Fix-Its with some sucess. Last one, dealing with firewall issues, said set Windows Firewall as default. Asked if running another firewall and disable it(Norton 2012) or check
 group policy settings. Looking into the steps for the group policy, unable to find/check them. Running Windows Vista 32 bit Home Premimum. Thanks Donald

            Hi Carole.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What works most times is to go to Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  
<br />
<br />But if it won't open move on to the next steps:
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>Hi abtranz,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To link or update your Skype and Microsoft account, you may refer to this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But, if you wish to link or combine a Skype account to another Skype account, please be advised this is not possible.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding your concern about people cannot search you and if you want the account to show up, and more importantly you are actually above
 18, you can change your date of birth on: <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another way to resolve this issue can also be found from the same section where you can edit your birthdate specifically the Discoverability
 section. Beside it is a tick box for “Include me in People Search and Suggestions”. Please ensure that it is ticked. Once done, please sign out and sign back in to your Skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions, kindly let us know.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you!
</span></span></p>
