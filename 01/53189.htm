    <title>Received call from Microsoft support about errors on my computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Received call from Microsoft support about errors on my computer</h2>
                    <p>I had a call today claiming to be from Microsoft. The person showed me (by phone) the event viewer and then I saw all the errors and warnings under Applications and System.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was a bit suspicious of this person and when he wanted to get someone else to remotely enter my PC to fix the problems it concerned me. I could not connect to the internet whilst he was on the phone and he said he'll call me back in 30 minutes
 and never did!</p>
<p>Anyway, can someone inform me? Was this likely to have been a genuine call from Microsoft? I do have loads of error and warnings in the event viewer and my PC takes ages to start up. Should I get back intouch with Microsoft so they can fix it or is there
 another way I can&nbsp;do it&nbsp;myself?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any advice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lt;Original post - I have loads of errors and warnings in the event viewer. Is this why my PC takes ages to start up and generally functions slowly? What is the best way to resolve this?&gt;</p>

<p>Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>If your system takes ages to start, you should first measure the current startup time down to the tenth of a second, take a look at the resulting measurements, see what is taking so long and why that is and fix it.&nbsp; Make your adjustments and measure it again
 until it doesn't take ages to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that my system takes exactly 28.03 seconds to boot from pressing the power button.&nbsp; That may not be practical for everyone, but until you measure it, you may not get a good result.</p>
<p>You can't just say it takes "too long" or it "seems faster" - you need to measure exactly how long it takes with some free, easy to use software tools designed just to measure your boot time so you will know exactly how long every start up item takes, and
 then when you see it, you can see what you can do about it (or you could just start trying things).</p>
<p>If you need help interpreting the events, you need to post the events so somebody can see them.&nbsp; I prefer to have zero warnings (no alarming looking entries are allowed in my Event Viewer) or errors in my Event Viewer and if I ever see one, I am going to
 figure it out and fix it if it is within my power.</p>
<p>No event in the Event Viewer should defy explanation.</p>
<p>Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.&nbsp; Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.&nbsp; Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp;
 Try to find just the events at the date<br />
and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information<br />
after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7035<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/14/2010<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:54:18 PM<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose<br />
Computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
The Remote Access Connection Manager service was successfully sent a start control.<br />
<br />
For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.</p>
<p><br />
To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered), then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the events that are happening when you have
 your issue.</p>

<p>That's good and if you want, someone can tell you how to measure accurately without using your eyeballs and ears and view every single startup item you have in a nice timing graph so you can see the entire startup process from end to end and see what is
 taking up that time and what things you can do without. &nbsp;Then you will know exactly how long every single startup item takes.</p>
<p>SideBySide is a technology that allows different versions of files and libraries with the same names installed on your system at the same time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you can't have two files of the same name in the same folder at the same time, applications you install will dynamically pull the files they need from&nbsp;separately&nbsp;installed&nbsp;folders.</p>
<p>Different applications need different sets of files, so XP puts them in&nbsp;separate&nbsp;folders for you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, .NET&nbsp;Framework&nbsp;products might require one version of a file, Visual Studio another and Adobe products might require even another version of the file(s) with the same name, so they need to be installed into separate folders and XP will take care
 of that for you.</p>
<p>When they are installed, XP will put them in separate folders that look like this:</p>
<p>C:\windows\WinSxS</p>
<p>Depending on the applications you have installed, you could need several versions of the libraries installed and many folders under your&nbsp;c:\windows\WinSxS folder.</p>
<p>For your SideBySide problem, it looks like you have some application installed that needs the Microsoft&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;Class Library&nbsp;(MFC) from the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package&nbsp;which&nbsp;you can download and install from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>
<p>After&nbsp;installing&nbsp;it, reboot and see if you still have SideBySide errors and if you do, post them.</p>
<p>It is possible that you need other C++ Redistributable packages installed (I have 5 different ones right now), but you can start with that one.</p>

            I think you might get some more/better ideas if you tell us something about your system.<br />
<br />
Since even the latest Microsoft Answers forum implementation STILL does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the
 frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If the system was working okay yesterday, what do you think happened between yesterday and today?<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 wont allow me to act as the administrator - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 wont allow me to act as the administrator</h2>
                    I recently did the free update to windows 10 and of course ran into a slew of new problems (what is ever REALLY free?). My biggest issues are the inability to create user accounts like "guest" or any account at all without using specific information and
 some form of email; and being unable to save any files AT ALL, ANYWHERE except the desktop because apparently I'm not the administrator (news to me) and I need the administrator's permission (just as soon as I find out who that is...). The laptop I'm using
 is for a massive amount of schoolwork that is very document-heavy. So basically saving files is pretty darn important. My most tech-savvy attempt at fixing my computer is turning it off and on again so please, when responding, think kindergarten level. Thanks

</p><blockquote>I recently did the free update to windows 10 and of course ran into a slew of new problems (what is ever REALLY free?). My biggest issues are the inability to create user accounts like "guest" or any account at all without using specific information
 and some form of email; and being unable to save any files AT ALL, ANYWHERE except the desktop because apparently I'm not the administrator (news to me) and I need the administrator's permission (just as soon as I find out who that is...). The laptop I'm using
 is for a massive amount of schoolwork that is very document-heavy. So basically saving files is pretty darn important. My most tech-savvy attempt at fixing my computer is turning it off and on again so please, when responding, think kindergarten level. Thanks

<h2>            How can I disable same window of same software showing in multiple windows</h2>
                    This might seems odd to your guys but when I try to create multiple desktop, I can still access stuff in other desktop -- &nbsp;both from the taskbar and using alt+tab shortcut without moving from one desktop to another by accessing the task view button. I
 am so confused. Please help! Thanks!

            In your Settings app, you can type "multi" into the search box to find the multi-tasking settings. Here you can decide whether or not the taskbar and alt+tab screens show windows from other desktops or not. &nbsp;That way you can fine-tune exactly how it works.

            Hi Ksea02, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. See below for how to change your font in Outlook Express. <br />
<br />
Go to the taskbar and choose Tools and then under Tools go to Internet Options. In the box that opens, you will see a General tab. Down at the bottom (the very bottom) you will see a button called "Fonts" without the quotes and another button called "Accessibility"
 also without the quotes. Click the "Fonts" button and choose your font and the size you want. Then click Apply and then click OK. After this, go again to Tools and then Internet Options to the General tab and this time click the Accessibility button. There
 are three items there. Put a check in the second and third boxes. In Internet Explorer, under the General tab, there is a place where you can set a Default font. You will see this on page where you chose your font style, size, and color. There is a button
 called Set As Default. Click on this. After you have done this, restart your computer and the font will change sizes.<br />
<br />

Hope this helps! <br />

<p>I do have another quick question for you guys. &nbsp;Are you all from one of the 13 launch regions that the console first launched in?</p>
<p>If so, then you guys should try hitting up @xboxsupport on Twitter to see what they suggest.</p>

    <title>Recovering lost sub-folders in Windows Live Mail 11 after restoring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzannesp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering lost sub-folders in Windows Live Mail 11 after restoring Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Tried Windows 10, didn't like it, so restored Windows 7 (within the 30 day time frame).&nbsp; Suddenly my Windows Live had two copies of every email&nbsp;stored in every folder, plus two versions of each folder, AND it downloaded an extra copy of&nbsp;all the&nbsp;emails in
 my webmail account (into the Inbox).&nbsp; It was incredibly time consuming to delete all these extra emails -&nbsp;I had to delete them one by one, couldn't delete several at a time as each one had a 'Windows 10 version' and a 'Windows 7' version, and if I tried to
 delete a block, I got an error message.&nbsp; However, I persevered and got rid of most of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there were entire&nbsp;extra folders, I was able to delete the entire sub-folder.&nbsp; The second, readable version of the sub-folder was still there - or so it appeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the next time I opened Windows Live, ALL my sub-folders were gone.&nbsp; As I periodically back up to an external hard drive, I&nbsp;assume they are available somewhere, but I have not had much luck importing and exporting emails in the past.&nbsp; Documents and
 pictures seem to back up and transfer easily, email not so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search (*.eml) which reveals 14,000 emails are still available for my perusal - they are NOT in folders, all jumbled together,&nbsp; thousands that have been previously deleted, plus thousands that WERE organized into folders according to subject and
 year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get my subfolders back, with their contents?&nbsp; I tried creating a single subfolder in the Inbox, as suggested somewhere, then closing and re-opening Windows Live.&nbsp; Tried it twice - nothing happened.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to avoid&nbsp;bringing all those
 multiple copies of each email back into my program -&nbsp;it took hours to&nbsp;do a basic clean up the first time. But I'd&nbsp;like my sub-folders - and WHY are all the supposedly deleted&nbsp;emails still somewhere on my hard drive, taking up space?&nbsp; I thought I'd permanently
 deleted them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your suggestions...thank you for reading this!</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestions.&nbsp; The webmail I referred to was Telus webmail, and none of my folders were ever in Telus webmail.&nbsp; Is there another webmail you are referring to?&nbsp; I established the folders in the 'inbox' of Windows Live Mail, on my home computer.</p>
<p>I tried repairing the Windows Live Mail as instructed.&nbsp; No recovery of folders.&nbsp; Then I tried uninstalling Windows Live Mail, and downloading and reinstalling as suggested.&nbsp; No recovery of folders.
</p>
<p>I do think this issue arose as a 'side effect' of restoring my operating system from Windows 10 to Windows 7.&nbsp; Over the last two days, all new incoming and outgoing email seems to be operating in the usual manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by searching *.eml, I can see that thousands of emails not visible from Windows Live Mail are in fact still somewhere on my computer.&nbsp; Is there any way to search for them by folder?</p>

            I'm having the same problems of having lost all my sub-folder after a Windows 7 (automatic) update late week. I have carried out the above instructions but without success. &nbsp;Thank you Suzanne for your tip on *eml; I now know at least my "lost" emails are
 somewhere in my machine.

Create another folder inside your backup drive folder for this entire backup and name it email yourname dd-mm-yy</li><li>Open the address book (Contact list) portion of Windows Live Mail</li><li>On the top towards the right, find the Export icon. Choose comma separated values</li><li>Click the browse button and navigate to your external hard drive folder for this backup and create yet another folder named address book yourname dd-mm-yy.</li><li>On the next screen choose which data elements to backup. I choose them all</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>Move your Mail folder (a one time thing)</strong></em></p>
<p>Windows Live Mail (WLM)&nbsp;sets itself up in a very inconvenient place.&nbsp; Hard to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is&nbsp;no reason
<strong>not</strong> to move it to a more accessible location on your hard drive.&nbsp; This is a one time thing.&nbsp;
<strong>Once you do it, you will never have to do it again</strong>.&nbsp; Now, make backing up that folder a regular part of your regular backup procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To move it:</p>
<ol>
<li>With WLM open, click on the little blue rectangle with the arrow in it on the top left of the WLM window</li><li>Click on Options then Mail, the Advanced tab, Maintenance, Store folder</li><li>Click the Change button.&nbsp; A navigation list of your hard drive pops up.</li><li>Now navigate to the C: line, click once on it.</li><li>Click Make new folder</li><li>Type <strong>your name</strong> followed by the word <strong>mail</strong>, click OK, Click OK</li><li>Close all the open windows.</li><li>Close WLM</li><li>When you next open WLM, it will take longer because that is when it actually moves your mail folder</li></ol>
<p>The reason you should do this is that in the future you will be following the back up procedure above, BUT also you will be backing up that Mail folder to your external hard drive as well.&nbsp; The reason to do this is that if ever your system needs to be re-built,
 the re-builder can copy that Mail folder to the right place in your ‚Äúnew‚Äù system and all of your mail, contacts, calendars and what&nbsp;ever the way you have WLM set up, will be in effect in the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Windows is re-built and all is working, download WLM 2011 from: <a href="http://filehippo.com/download_windows_live_mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://filehippo.com/download_windows_live_mail/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;this is the 2011 version which works better than the 2012 one.&nbsp; The main advantage of the 2011 version is that Groups do not work in 2012.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>'</p>
<p>If you do not use groups, download WLM 2012 from the Microsoft site</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start your newly installed WLM and <em><strong>ignore all messages.&nbsp; </strong>
</em></li><li>In WLM, click the tiny arrow icon on the nearly top left.&nbsp; Choose Options, Mail</li><li>Click the Advanced tab, now Maintenance, Store folder</li><li>Use your mouse to select the entire content shown in that window, Ctrl+C to copy it.</li><li>Close WLM</li><li>Navigate to the location you just copied by pasting (Ctrl+V) it into the text box above the start button</li><li>Delete all the contents of this folder, but not the folder, which will now be empty.</li><li>Copy the content (not the folder) of your backed-up WLM, and paste it into the folder you just deleted the contents of.</li><li>Start WLM, and you will have everything back just as you had it before.&nbsp; No importing, no having to go and reset everything back the way you like it.&nbsp; You won‚Äôt even have to set up the accounts again.&nbsp; This even has your passwords.</li><li>Type indexing options into the text box above the start globe</li><li>Click Modify and add your new Windows Live Mail folder.</li></ol>
<p>You should now use the ‚Äúmove‚Äù procedure above on your new or newly re-built PC.</p>

            Thanks CT for the advice. However the other unresolved problem on my computer is that the "back-up" facility was corrupted by the move back from Windows 10 to 7. Really starting to think Windows "updates" are a very bad idea üòä

            <p>I have always rejected "automatic" backup systems.&nbsp; Too error prone and too many instances of not working when you needed them.&nbsp; Like a fire extinguisher that does not work.</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Backing up</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>PLEASE DO IT NOW! Nothing is sadder than a person who has just lost all the data in their computer. You should NOT backup your programs. Keep the disks that have the software you bought along with the ‚Äúproduct keys‚Äù or activation keys. There are also a number
 of programs that are free and downloaded from the Internet that do not need to be backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 and Vista, you will find a folder named <em><strong>Users (C:Users)</strong></em>.&nbsp; In that folder you will find each user that is set up on the computer.&nbsp; In the user folder you will find Folders for documents, music, pictures and videos, and
 others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy your data on to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Without a doubt a USB connected external storage drive is the best way.&nbsp; It‚Äôs best to back up on a routine basis, for example monthly. See the web page on this site about what to buy in and external hard drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.canadiantech.info/sample-page-2/buying-a-new-computer-pc/backup-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.canadiantech.info/sample-page-2/buying-a-new-computer-pc/backup-hardware/</span></a></p>
<p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend backup programs&nbsp;‚Äî even the one built into Windows.&nbsp; These programs were originally designed to save backup space.&nbsp;They&nbsp;usually produce files that are only usable by the program that created them and the space they save
 is not expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second benefit they have is to pre-program what is backed up, and in Windows 7, that is no longer a problem because it is all in your User folder, with minor exceptions such as Quick Books and Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>Making copies of all data files will allow you to replace a single damaged or lost file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, very high capacity external hard drives are available very cheaply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although it is technically possible to backup to a memory stick (AKA thumb drive), it is a bad practice.&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Memory sticks are not that reliable, they are good for smaller files being moved.&nbsp; The memory technology inside has a limited capability of writes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I strongly recommend an external USB connect hard drive.&nbsp; They can be bought for $40 to $150 with vastly more space ‚Äî like
 500 to 2000Gb.&nbsp; They are dramatically faster ‚Äî like 20 times.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend so-called ‚Äúcloud‚Äù backups.&nbsp; When you do this, you are storing a copy of your data in someone else‚Äôs computer that may some day be hacked or just shut down.&nbsp; It is of little value since you can buy your own capacity cheaply.&nbsp;
 Then you know where it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In many years of doing this work, I have lost count of the number of clients whose backups did not restore because of problems with the way the backup software
 stored the data.&nbsp; Some of these systems backup what was changed.&nbsp; The result of that is that you have many individual files that must be logically reassembled to do a restore from this backup.&nbsp; If just one of these files is faulty, the entire restore is impossible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Backup software had its birth when space was very expensive and the software ‚Äúcompressed‚Äù the data to take less space.&nbsp; Today, that is certainly not an issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I recommend a simple process of drag and drop.&nbsp; Connect the external drive.&nbsp; Make a folder on it with your name and today‚Äôs date.&nbsp; Open that folder as a window,
 not full screen.&nbsp; Slide that window to one side.&nbsp; Open&nbsp;your C: drive in another window side-by-side.&nbsp; Find the folders/files you want to backup and simply drag and drop to the backup.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp;
<strong>Use the RIGHT button to do the dragging </strong>(opposite if you mouse is set up for a left-hander).&nbsp; That way, when you drop it, it will ASK you if you want to copy, move or cancel.&nbsp; Of course, this method takes away the automatic scheduling convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 But, I have never seen this kind of backup fail anyone.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another hint, this is a Windows-wide feature ‚Äì you can choose a number of folders at one time.&nbsp; If your list is contiguous, select the fist in the group, hold down the Shift key, select the last in the group.&nbsp; If your list is non-contiguous, select the first,
 hold down the Ctrl key, select each and every other folder.&nbsp; Then you can drag and drop a whole group at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backing up your favorites in Internet Explorer</strong>: Open Internet Explorer. Click File, Import and Export, Next. Choose Export Favorites. Click Next then Next. Browse to the same Backup folder. Give the file that you are about to export a name
 like: XXXX‚Äôs favorites xx-xx-xx. Click Save, Next Finish, OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;use <strong>Windows Live&nbsp;mail</strong>, your contacts and email are on your computer you need to back them up to.&nbsp; See a separate item on this web site&nbsp;on how to do that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you have data in files and folders in places in other folders, you will need to do the same thing with these. You will also need to repeat this process for each user on your computer.&nbsp;<em>Do not&nbsp;backup software or applications.</em></p>

<p>Hi Amine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons that you're unable to install updates or access the store could be a wrong configuration of proxy server. To look more closely into this, kindly answer these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact proxy setting error that you're getting when you try to install an update?</li><li>What is the exact box that you uncheck in the Internet properties? This will help us identify the error.</li><li>Just to clarify, are you using Windows 10 Home as your operating system?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, kindly click the <strong>Reset...</strong> option under <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in
<strong>Internet Properties</strong> and then restart your computer. This will help us to go back to the default state of your proxy server.</p>
        </p>

<li>i tried to diagnose the problem that is behind "Windows Update" 's failure &nbsp;! the utility confirms that windows is unable to automatically detect the proxy settings for my network!&nbsp;</li><li>all the boxes are currently unchecked ! i want to check the "automatically detect settings" box ! but when i click on OK to save changes nothing happens ! so the problem is that i can't change the settings to automatically or to anything else ! the window
 doesn't respond to clicks on the "OK" button! it seems like some software is blocking me from changing the proxy settings . &nbsp;</li></ul>

            We really appreciate your patience regarding this matter, Amine.<br />
<br />
We also understand that you got this issue for a while now, but can you still remember the changes made on your device before the Proxy settings went hayway?<br />
<br />
Let's see if the same Proxy issue will occur on a new administrator account. This will get us a hint if you have a corrupted user account.
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a></strong>'s
<strong>how to create a new administrator account in Windows 10</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, let's perform a <strong>Clean Boot </strong>to see if an app is causing the issue.

<h2>            Lagging in starting windows 10</h2>
                    I have currently windows 10 installed on my laptop. It was working Ok befofe 2-3 days. Today I started my PC and noticed an issue. The PC takes too much time to come to the desktop screen from welcome screen. First when I enter my password and welcome
 screen appears, the computer stays for 5-10 seconds in welcome screen then a blank screen appears and it stays for 1 minute approximately. Then he desktop appears. The whole time from entering passwords to working desktop screen is almost 1.5 minutes. What
 can I do to resolve my issue. Plus My start menu when clicked opens after 20-30 seconds. Programs like vlc and other similar programs are lagging or crashing. Windows search doesn't come up at all. I know its a lot to take on. Please answer my questions. iI
 need immediate help.

<p>No my windows isn't updated . It does have the anniversary upgrade. I tried to install the anniversary update using windows 10 upgrade tool but it showed error in in installation not in download. I followed the steps to remove the error using the error code
 solutions on Microsoft Community. But still no improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes my drivers are up-to-date. I have downloaded my drivers from device manufacturer's website. My pc is hp pavilion g4 1305au. It has a problem installing the the amd hd graphic drivers. It started lagging since the time I tried installing the driver. Vlc
 started crashing. Plus the time when I tried installing ‚Äãthe driver there was a sudden system failure and system said it had to re-start. I let it happen but after that it started lagging even more. I tried system restore but there was a error 0x81000204.&nbsp;</p>

            Since you've mentioned that you're still in the <strong>Anniversary Update</strong>, have you tried upgrading your Windows 10 to
<strong>Creators Update</strong>? If yes, did the same issue occurred? It's possible that the latest update of you drivers is compatible with the latest version of Windows 10 as well, which might be the reason you're experiencing this kind of issue.<br />
<br />
You can also see if the issue persists if you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
roll back your display adapter</span> on the <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the same issue exists even after upgrading to the <strong>Creators Update</strong> and rolling back your driver, let's reset your PC with the option to keep your files. You can refer to the selection entitled, "<strong>Reset this PC</strong>", and the option

<h2>            Open File - Security Warning box in windows 7 </h2>
                    
<p>we have just uprgraded to windows 7 and have several computers in a small office running on a network.&nbsp; One PC holds all the data including 2 databases.&nbsp; I keep getting an OPEN FILE - SECURITY&nbsp;WARNING each time I want to open a database on the shared folders
 PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;have to click&nbsp;the OPEN button in the warning box - but I can't find a way of disabling this - there isn't an option in the warning box to 'tick' if you don't want to be asked again.
<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help <br />

            Hi <strong>mikeoscar,</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
To eliminate the ‚ÄúOpen File Security Warning‚Äù from programs accessed from the file server.<br />
<br />
Add the IP or FQDN of the network computer to your Local Intranet or Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start, Run and type INETCPL.CPL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Select the Security tab, Trusted sites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Sites button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add the IP address of the remote computer to the list<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (You can also add the network shares to the Local Intranet zone.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Uncheck Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone and click Close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click OK, OK and close the dialog <br />
<br />
You should no longer get the ‚ÄúOpen File Security Warning‚Äù when you run an application from the file server.<br />

            <p>I too had a similar problem with annoying "Open File" Security warnings appearing one after the other on the Windows 7 taskbar. Word of caution, before you go disabling any security features in your Windows 7, it's there for a reason. If that feature was
 turned off, I would have never been tipped off that it might have been malware related. Sure enough a trojan wormed it's way on to my system and was able to get the issue fixed by running "Malwarebytes" and "MS Security Essientials".&nbsp; Immediately, after running
 those tools and a clean reboot, problem gone.</p>

            <p>Try using the Avast! Removal Tool:</p>
<a href="http://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>avast</strong>! Uninstall Utility | Download aswClear for
<strong>avast</strong>! <strong>Removal</strong></a>
<p>If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>open the Microsoft System Configuration Utility, click Start, type: msconfig then hit Enter on your board.</p>
<p>Under the General tab, select Selective startup then click Apply and OK</p>
<p>Restart your computer. Once in Selective Startup mode, proceed to uninstall the program, go back to msconfig and select Normal startup so Windows will load normally.</p>
<p>Suppose Diagnostic mode fails to uninstall the troublesome program? Here is another solution? This will require that install a freeware utility called Revouninstaller, there is also a paid version, but the free version should be enough for most users needs.
 Revouninstaller is very detailed and provides insightful details about the program it is attempting to uninstall, including things like registry entries and where the program places files on your hard disk.</p>
<p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware). Here‚Äôs a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

<h2>            Microsoft have destroyed my brand new Acer Aspire laptop - can&#39;t get past a blue screen asking for a &#39;security code&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    


I bought a brand new Acer Aspire laptop with Windows 8 and a whole pile of pre-installed, unwanted Microsoft apps in the UK before moving out to Israel for at least 6 months. I upgraded to W 8.1 but most apps wouldn't work in the Israel region, although their VILE Xbox music app would and I stupidly started using it. It kept harassing me to subscribe and after a few declines, Microsoft started demanding that I 'verify' my account with them! Since I'm abroad I attempted to change my 'security settings' to stop a verification code being sent to my UK mobile and consequently Microsoft locked me out of all my accounts with them including hotmail  skype, which I use A LOT. This impacted on all the other apps on my laptop until I was forced to 'recover' it (at less than 5 weeks old!!!!) to reinstall the manufacturers setting back to Windows 8. This sorted and another few, painful hours of waiting for 'updates' to complete, it prompted me to download Windows 8.1 as I had before. On the last st

            Thanks for your response. I can't get past the blue screen to gain access to my laptop to get any instructions. There's just a blue screen with a caption on the top that says 'enter your security code' and an ever revolving wheel that says 'please wait'
 as if it's busy doing something but it hasn't moved from this for 6 days now! You can't escape out of the screen or shut down or anything; can only physically switch the laptop off and when switched back on, the same screen appears! That's where it's stuck!&nbsp;

            It doesn't work and is a complete waste of time, as you know! I'm not wasting another PENNY calling their useless customer services AGAIN. I simply want to know how to make an official complaint against Microsoft and how to be financially compensated for
 my losses caused by MICROSOFT. Who and how do I reach them by EMAIL?!
