<h2>            Corrupted Registry Unable to Boot - How To Fix with CMD From Bootable Installation USB&#63; DISM Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Last night, Windows 10 pushed an update. In the morning, it was stuck in a reboot loop where it would continually fail to repair itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I spent the day trying to fix it, but I couldn't find anything that worked. Currently, I am stuck with "The operating system couldn't be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Code 0x0000225 "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I tried that did NOT work (And made it worse):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Attempting to repair the BCD (Access denied)</li><li>Disabling automatic recovery mode in the BCD (Which now means I can't access command prompt from the native system, and I also can't reset the setting)</li><li>chkdsk (No errors found)</li><li>sfc /scannow (No errors found)</li><li>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth&nbsp; &nbsp;(Various issues, highlighted below)</li></ul>
<p>DISM is the most promising, but I can't get it to run. My only way to work on the system is to boot into the installation USB, and navigate to the command prompt. Whenever I run DISM, it errors "Error 50&nbsp; &nbsp;DISM does not support servicing Windows PE..." and
 if I remove /Online with /Source:X:\Windows I get "Error: 87&nbsp; &nbsp;the cleanup-image option is unknown".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't have an option to do a system reset keeping personal data, because I can't do anything with the native system. Initially I didn't want to deal with reinstalling 100 gigabytes of programs because of a windows update... But now that seems like it would
 have taken half the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to at least try using the DISM tool, but I can't get it to work from the install USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi RCA.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Good news, Microsoft is changing Update policies soon as announced recently here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/#25qbCuAVA5Vkx6mC.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />Until then you can manage Updates with all possible options here:

<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll respond in the same order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I can only use the "Repair Your Computer" from the bootable USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Booted in like before to the USB, no issues here</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Startup Repair fails like usual, which was the initial problem. There is no "Reset PC" option under troubleshoot, because this is the bootable USB. I cannot access the troubleshoot options on the main system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) I am going to do everything I can to avoid a new install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you have any insight about how to make DISM run?</p>
        </p>

<p>I have an update (no solution yet):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a backup of C:\Windows\System32\config\*</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all files and subfolders in config\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied X:\Windows\System32\config\*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\config\*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shut off computer, and restarted. Windows begins to boot. After loading a few seconds, it hits a blue screen with the error: "CRITICAL PROCESS DIED"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then replaced the DRIVERS file I copied into C:\Windows\System32\config\&nbsp; with my old DRIVERS file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot, same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled boot logging, and tried again. Also note that I DID attempt to use the auto fix from the bootable install disk, but it still fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the contents of the boot log:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Version 10.0 (Build 17763)</p>
</p><p>Maybe this will give some insight into the issue at hand. I assume that the process dies as msrpc.sys attempts to run (and may be the process that dies).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2: I reverted config on C back to the original, then only replaced the SYSTEM file. The system will attempt to boot, fail because critical process died, but NOW, it "gathers information" and reboots. After
 the reboot, the system file is broken again.&nbsp;</p>

            You should have the choice for Reset on the Troubleshoot in the bootable media which may work better because it doesn't rely on the onboard files.  
<br />
<br />If not I would save time by skipping to the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<p>There is no reset option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Options for bootable install USB are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>System Restore</li><li>Uninstall Updates</li><li>System Image Recovery</li><li>Startup Repair</li><li>Command Prompt</li><li>UEFI Firmware Settings</li></ol>
<p>Once again, none of these options are viable, and again, I would rather not begin with a new install.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;At least from Windows 10 1803, the registry backup is no longer populated. See&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a421027e-e57d-4d2f-8ba1-2b3bb629e6ad/regback-files-are-empty?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a421027e-e57d-4d2f-8ba1-2b3bb629e6ad/regback-files-are-empty?forum=win10itprogeneral</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I have the folder but it's empty. I have no clue why this was discontinued, but it's certainly hurting me now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last clean install was 5 months ago. My issue with a new clean install is that it seems wholly unnecessary. I have a fairly slow internet connection, and re-installing all the software I need would be a long and painful process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the ability to run regedit, and have installed a portable registry cleaning program. It detects errors after each attempted boot, fixes them, but they return each time the system boots.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe that every time the system boots up, it tries to complete the update, which breaks the registry and a critical process resulting in a BSOD. A potential solution would be to manually delete the file that attempts to alter the registry/processes,
 which is likely part of the updater. I don't have the info to do this though.</p>

            What exactly is this "registry cleaner" because I know of none that are not harmful to Windows, and often only running one once will ruin the install.  
<br />
<br />Even CCleaner's formerly accepted Registry Cleaner is now not recommended by anyone due to Avast bloatware buying them from the genius developer who kept his creation in a state of perfection at all times.  
<br />
<br />So what I would do is follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with ONLY the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then save a System Image backup of the finished job so you can roll it back in case any problems occur, but none have been reported that I have seen after several million uses of that install since Windows 7 beta.

<p>Have you tried removing the update that cause the problem in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the update from the recovery environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to the command line part and use diskpart to find out with which drive letter your windows installation is recognized:</p>
<p>
</p><p>list volume</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Let's say it identifies your Windows partition as d:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /image:d:\ /get-packages</p>
<p>
</p><p>* this will list the packages you have installed. Note down the Package Identifier of the last installed update something like:</p>
<p>Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you run something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /image:d:\ /remove-package /packageName:Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use dism to try to restore your broken windows with good files form your installation usb. Let's say it is recognized as e:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /image:d /cleanup-image /restorehealth /source:E:\source /LimitAccess</p>
<p>
</p><p>* where e:\source is where the installation files are. Malso be something like "e:\source\x64"</p>
<p>"e:\source\install.esd"</p>
<p>"e:\source\install.wim</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure, try some of this out.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot sync my Google contacts with People desktop app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot sync my Google contacts with People desktop app</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 64-bit and have been trying to sync my contacts to the desktop people app. I have linked my Google account to people by going to settings, add account, google, and filling in the information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Under the mailbox sync settings I have:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Always download full emails and internet images"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sync Contacts and Calendars [Every 2 Hours]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sync Options: Contacts [On]</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Advanced&nbsp; Mailbox Settings:</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming email server [imap.gmail.com:993:1] </p>
<ul>
<li>(I also tried to change the value "993" to 995" because I saw on Google's site that it uses port 995, this caused an error code: 0x80048830. I searched this error and found some information about TSL/SSL on an ESET forum.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Outgoing (SMTP) email server [smtp.gmail.com:465:1] </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outgoing Requires Server Authentication: [Checked] </p>

</p><p>Use the same user name and password for sending mail: [Checked]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts server (CardDAV): [https://www.google.com] </p>
<ul>
<li>(I have also tried google.com and www.google.com&nbsp;for this setting)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing I have tried is to delete the Gmail account, remove windows from Google Account permissions, turn on two step verification for Gmail, re-enter my Gmail credentials with 2 step verification through the desktop People app, and try to sync again.
 This did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also tried turning the Firewall off and&nbsp;syncing the account with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing I tried was to go to Network Connections &gt; Properties (of my internet connection (Wi-Fi adapter)) &gt; Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) &gt; Properties &gt; Use the following DNS server addresses (8:8:8:8 as preferred) (8:8:4:4 as alternate) [Which
 are the free google DNS server addresses. I restarted my internet connection and tried to sync my google contacts to people again. This did not get contacts synced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried doing the above technique but instead: Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) &gt; Properties &gt; Use the following DNS server addresses: Preferred [2001:4860:4860::8888] Alternate [2001:4860:4860::8844]. Restarted my internet connection. This also
 did nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(NOTE: I tried the IPv4 DNS settings stand-alone first, then I tried the IPv6 DNS settings in conjunction with the Google IPv4 DNS settings.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>
<p>

    <title>Why is cmd window size limited to largest monitor&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptousig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is cmd window size limited to largest monitor&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When using multiple monitors, I cannot make a cmd.exe window any larger than the largest of my monitors (for example, span it across 3 monitors). Why is that? And is there a way around it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other windows like notepad does not have this limitation.</p>

            <p>The command line can only show a specific number of columns of letters from left to right, and this number is locked in place based on legacy since the 1980's when the command prompt was first built.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not related to your monitor size or anything, just the number of letters it can show in a row.</p>

            <p>It does not behave as you describe.</p>
<p>The number of rows and columns is not "locked in place".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the "Screen Buffer Size" settings under the system menu/properties to something like Width: 9999 and Height: 9999 and then start resizing the window. You'll have far more rows and columns than my&nbsp;IBM XT did in 1983.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see that you can resize the cmd window to fill your entire monitor, but you cannot extend it to cover two monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know why that limit was introduced to cmd.exe but not other apps.</p>

            <p>Nope, I don't buy that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No&nbsp;other resizable window is&nbsp;limited to the largest monitor.</p>
<p>There are a few apps&nbsp;that have a maximum size, but they are a fixed maximum size.</p>
<p>This behaviour of limiting to the monitor size is specific to cmd.exe.</p>

                    Window 7&nbsp; 64bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LX 3000 usb headset&nbsp; (age is over 5+ years)<br />
HP computer desktop with pentuim something like that <br />
and it is upgraded to w7 from vista <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ok so far this LX 3000 is working for an app for TeamSpeak and i am guessing will work for other apps such as skype and messeging apps but it will not work with sound to play music or movies
<br />
<br />
i can not get it to play internet radio such as pandora through the browser<br />
and <br />
i can not get it to work with Spotify which is a stand alone online radio app <br />
and <br />
i can not get it to work with Window Media Player (WMP)<br />
<br />
and i have downloaded the life chat software from microsoft but still no go <br />
<br />
and i have checked all available sounds and also from control panel as well <br />
<br />
and i hope this is not a setting that it will cut off other apps but if so i like to be able to listen to music while i use chat app such at TeamSpeak
<br />
<br />
so i need to get this to work on multiple apps&nbsp; <br />

    <title>Watermark SecureBoot isn&#39;t configured correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Watermark SecureBoot isn&#39;t configured correctly</h2>
                    Hi.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 professional on my Acer Aspire V5-572P. I got the upgrade from my Dreamspark account and performed an update (selected "keep all files, apps and settings").</div>
<div>Since the update, there has been a watermark on my desktop that says:<br />
"Windows 8.1 pro</div>
<div>SecureBoot isn't configured correctly</div>
<div>Build 9600"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched forums, updated my bios, made sure SecureBoot was enabled in the bios, all to no avail.</div>
<div>Yesterday, I contacted Acer support and they told me they don't have support for Windows 8.1 yet. So they told me to contact Microsoft.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any more ideas of what I could do?</div>
<div>I don't want to have to do another clean install.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Thanks for the answers and sorry for getting back to you so late. Somehow I didn't get the e-mail notification.</p>
<p>I put it in "update" because I couldn't find a topic since the official release of the pro version is not until October 17th (I got&nbsp;a student release&nbsp;on Dreamspark). Since&nbsp;Microsoft is calling it an "update" I decided to put it in this subtopic.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I usually always perform clean installs, because I want to get rid of all the traces of the useless&nbsp;junk that comes pre-installed on most machines.&nbsp;No, it is not the same laptop. It's actually my friend's who studies at the same uni and also uses a Dreamspark
 account for Windows software.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I figured out how to solve the problem today:</p>
<p>I&nbsp;navigated to&nbsp;Edit Group Policy&nbsp;(via search) -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; All Settings&nbsp; -&gt;</p>
<p>double clicked&nbsp;"use enhanced boot configuration data&nbsp;validation profile", which was not configured and hit "enable".</p>
<p>After a restart, the watermark was gone.<br />
</p>

            Not sure about BIOS options for the Acer but I have Lenovo T430 and the only way I could get rid of the watermark was to use the Secureboot Reset option in the BIOS which reset the Secureboot keys and certificates to factory settings which included Windows
 8 certificates with the current BIOS. Once I did this, the computer restarted and the watermark was gone.

            <p>I had to turn off my SecureBoot. A while back got a new PC, a bit later I got a new better video card. After installing new card the PC would beep over and over. Repair shop looked into it and only way to get it to stop that beeping was to turn off SecureBoot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there another way to stop the beeping without disabling SecureBoot?</p>

            Are you trying to connect a digital camera or video cam?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It seems that your camera could be several years old and you might not get it to work with Windows 7:<br />

<p>The impression that the tech's seem to be getting appears to not answer the question at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that all of us here are not just interested in changing the windows background from the slideshow but to change all the colors in each window to another.&nbsp;
</p>
m
<p>The basic, seemingly non-custoizemable white background of every window opened is to say the least annoying, At the extreme the white background is in fact painful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have temporary vision challenges that can make this "standard" background and text color a challenge to use.&nbsp; Indeed for me the default and apparently immutable colors painful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never liked the default colors used in windows, and have always changed them since win 3.11.&nbsp; No changes to the slide show is either desired nor wanted. &nbsp; FYI,&nbsp; I prefer a teal background as easier on my eyes.&nbsp; The high contrast choice is much too
 stark and makes reading the screen no better than the white screens.</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps, I am hopeful, this is clear enough to get a cogent answer on how to change all colors within windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So how do I customize the colors of the windows in windows?</p>

            If you see that message, your system is not going to be booting in any kind of mode until you fix it.<br />
<br />
It is <i>extremely </i>unlikely that the file is really missing or corrupt in spite of what the error message says.<br />
<br />
The problem is usually going to be some corruption in your NT File System (NTFS) which means that XP just can't find the file, or somehow your c:\boot.ini has gotten buggered and XP is looking for the file in the wrong place - both situations are generally
 easy to fix (but not from that link to About.com). <br />
<br />
Many of the ideas in that generic link make little or no sense or are just plain impossible (no offense Shenan) and likely composed by someone that has never actually fixed this problem before or knows how XP works.<br />
<br />
This is one of the dumbest ideas from that link (if anybody wants to know why, I will be happy to tell you):<br />
<br />
<i>Restore the hal.dll file from the Windows XP CD. If the hal.dll file is truly the cause of the problem, restoring it from the original Windows XP CD may do the trick.</i><br />
<br />
If you want to fix this issue, you need to tell us more about your system and how it got this way:<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Do you have any external hard drives connected to your system (you need to be sure XP is not trying to boot from some external hard drive device that does not have a hal.dll file).
<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />

</p><p>I have a Samsung SSD 840EVO with Magician installed and I tried to reinstall Win10 nvidia drivers (both 353.62&nbsp;and 353.30) but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you&nbsp;know how to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Massimiliano</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hello Kudosbarf,<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
To turn OFF the Digital signature do these steps:-</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span><span><span>Open the Command Prompt window by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then
 Right clicking Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator.</span></span></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><span><span>On the Command Prompt type in the command&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>“<strong>Bcdedit.exe
 /set nointegritychecks ON</strong>” without the quotes.</span></span></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><span><span>This will disable the Digital Signature.</span></span></span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>Digital signatures are used to help verify
 file authenticity.</span> <span>A digital signature is an electronic security mark that can be added to files. It allows you to verify the publisher of a file and helps verify that the file has not changed since it was digitally signed.</span>
<span>If the file does not have a valid digital signature, there is no way for you to be sure that the file is actually from the source it claims to be from, or that it has not been tampered with (possibly by a virus) since it was published. It's safer to avoid
 opening the file unless you know for certain who created it and whether the contents are safe to open. Even a valid digital signature does not verify that the contents of the file are harmless. You must decide if you should trust the contents of the file based
 on the identity of the publisher and where you are downloading the file from. <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information check the link “What is digital Signature?” -
</span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/077238d3-2e78-4655-872c-6d59462840111033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/077238d3-2e78-4655-872c-6d59462840111033.mspx</span></span></a><span><span>
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
You may have to contact the manufacturer to check if the firmware update is a valid update.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let me know if this worked.<br />
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype accounts that are inactive for 5 years will be automatically deleted on the Skype directory. After the migration, deleting of Skype accounts
 must be done on Skype user’s end. Skype support representatives do not have any access in deleting Skype accounts.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To recover an old account, you need to know the details of the account like the Skype Name or the registered email address. If you still have
 access to the registered email address or the security proof of the account, you may reset your password on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in the event that you do not have access to any of the security proofs registered on the account, this time you need to answer our online
 recovery form to get back to your Skype account. <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

    <title>Error Code 0x801901f4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jarrodfichter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 0x801901f4</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have been having an ongoing issue for nearly two years and I have not been able to get any resolution for it. I have constantly received the above error code any time I try to install/update from the Windows Store, making it impossible
 to obtain new apps, and recently I have been unable to verify my ID under account settings on my PC. In fact, it seems every time I WAS able to verify, the next day it would tell me AGAIN to verify. Hence, I am unable to resume being part of the Insider program,
 or much of anything involving the usage of my ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a frustrating issue for me, and shy of resetting my PC I am unsure what to do. There is almost no information on this error code anywhere, and from what little I could find, it states something about trying to read/write to a read-only section.
 Which makes no sense to me what this would have to do with my ID. I also have the latest updates installed, before anyone asks. Has anyone else had this issue?</p>

<br />Try this.
<br />Create a new local admin account. 
<br />Login to that account then run the updates.
<br />Make sure the account is admin!

<p>Hi there, thanks for responding. I've actually tried that in the past, but it seems to only be a temporary fix and doesn't solve the problem. I wonder if there's a way to actually fix the account itself, without having to reset the PC. Unless I'm just stuck
 until I can manage to get a new PC.<br />

            Yeah then the only thing i would suggest is resetting your PC unfortunately since it has been happening for over 2 years.
<br />you could try a repair upgrade but that might just be a band aid.
<br />see link below by Andre Da Costa on how to do a repair upgrade.
<br />

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />

<p>Miraculously enough, I was able to get the Insider program to cooperate with me, and my identity verified. Now the problem remains of unable to install any new apps via the Store.<br />

    <title>Problems with Creators Update and Broadcom 440x adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bacillus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Creators Update and Broadcom 440x adapter</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have an old dell inspiron 1520 that I'm been using quite happily with the latest build of&nbsp;win 10 pro 32 bit version 1607. Everything works great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the Creators Update iso using the MCT program. The update goes fine but this is where the issues start. First off I can't detect my wifi connection nor any other neighbouring ones. I have an Intel 4965agn wifi card and using driver version 13.4.0.139
 with the power management option turned off. I have had absolutely no issue using this hardware/driver combo with all previous versions of win10. Device manager tells me that the card is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next issue is&nbsp;windows&nbsp;is stuck when&nbsp;I try to restart, the screen message is states &nbsp;"restarting" with the moving busy ring below it. Only way to stop it is to do a hard shutdown. I've tried disabling fast start up with no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the update on two occasions now (had restored back to 1607 from a backup image then retried a second time). Something is not right with this update and my laptop so I've gone back to ver 1607 where everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have&nbsp;any ideas on what the problem could be or do I have to hope that MS finds a fix for me? Also can I stop Windows Update from trying to install this update next week?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the latest cumulative update has the Broadcom 440x fix.&nbsp; It was released 18 hours ago.&nbsp; For those that are curious this is build 15063.502.&nbsp; This has been a long four month drive to getting this fix investigated, fixed, and released.&nbsp;
 Thank you all for your patience.&nbsp; If you continue to have issues with the Broadcom 440x after applying this update please let us know on this thread.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks Guys!&nbsp; That means a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you are curious about my role here and how we do this...I am an engineer in the Quality team that owns Core Networking.&nbsp; This includes LAN, firewall, TCP/IP, and a host of other basic networking technologies.&nbsp; I also work closely with those in wifi,
 cellular, and printing.&nbsp; My job is to identify bugs after we release and drive the fixes back in the product.&nbsp; In this case I was notified from a colleague that our telemetry was reporting a d<span>isproportionate
</span>rise in update roll backs with this network adapter.&nbsp; I went to this forum and to reddit to try to corroborate what we were seeing.&nbsp; Once I saw it was an issue I tried to get hardware that had this adapter.&nbsp; This was hard to do as this is Vista era.&nbsp;
 I went through Tyler who is our Support contact to get logs directly from some of you.&nbsp; I also found a guy I worked with that had a personal Dell Inspiron 9300 at home that he donated to the cause.&nbsp; With logs from the community and the repro laptop we determined
 the cause quickly.&nbsp; I built a fix myself to prove that it worked and started engaging with the owners of TCPIP to get the fix put in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A question that is often asked is "how many people are affected by this".&nbsp; The answer for the Broadcom 440x issue is about 150,000.&nbsp; That represents a very small percentage of all windows 10 users.&nbsp; Something like .03%.&nbsp; However I was always able to point
 to this thread for justification to get the fix in.&nbsp; In other words...this fix was brought by you.&nbsp; Without your engagement I would not have had the ammunition to get the fix approved.&nbsp; So thank you very much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please continue to post your issues on the forums, reddit, twitter, and most importantly Feedback Hub.&nbsp; There are lots of here that read through what you have to say.&nbsp; I weekly present your posts to managers and directors so they understand the joys and
 pains you experience. &nbsp;</p>

 Microsoft password", but I can't do that without the correct device password, which it keeps telling me is wrong, but I know it isn't! This is a brand new laptop that I literally cannot log in to! Please help.&nbsp;

            Hi, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
<div><br />
From the description provided, I understand that you are unable to login to your Microsoft Account in your laptop.</div>
<div><br />
Kindly perform the below suggested methods and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</div>
<div>
<p>1. Check whether the <strong>language option for the keyboard </strong>is not changed from the Login screen, which would also affect the password you are typing in.<br />
2. Check whether the <strong>Date and Time settings on your computer is synced</strong>.<br />
3. <strong>Reset the password </strong>and check if it helps. You can log into the Microsoft account website
<a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://login.live.com/</span></a> and reset the password and then check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the issues related to login to Microsoft Account can be fixed with those easy steps.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not able to login to using the Microsoft account then ensure that you are typing the password correctly. Make sure that Caps Lock is turned off, and that your email address is spelled correctly, and then try again.</p>
