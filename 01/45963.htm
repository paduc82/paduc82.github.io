<h2>            Is using a KMS legal&#63;</h2>
                    There are many KMSs out on the internet that offer you free Windows 10 (any version) activation, but my question is, are they legal?

            Hi IdoRon,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />No, they are not legal. Be aware of those KMS, some of them might include virus/malware that might damage your PC.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hey IdoRon,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />Solutions like KMSpico to bypass legitimate activation spoofing a Key Management Services server is illegal. Consumers should not endeavor on activating Windows through those means. Activation servers (KMS) through an organization or educational institution is legal, and should be used for those intents and purposes.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<h2>            Internet connection not working after virus scan</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently did a virus scan with Adaware and now I can't connect to the internet. I assume Adaware muts have deleted or changed a file preventing me from connecting. When I try to access the Internet, Trhough IE or Opera, screen pops up saying it can't access
 the internet. On the Local Area Connection, the status says&nbsp; "aquiring network address", but does this indefinitely and never connects.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help with this. Right now I'm accessing the internet through my work computer.</p>

            Unfortunately there is no setting to turn this off as of yet.
<br />Many have asked.
<br />I would recommend that you let Microsoft know directly through the feedback hub that you want to able to disable this.
<br />see link and sorry can't be more help.

    <title>Windows Updates Deletes ALL Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orcd3viler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Updates Deletes ALL Games</h2>
                    <p>So I get home from work today and load up Diablo 3 to get a little gaming time in, shortly after starting Windows 10 decides its time to restart with no warning closes everything out and installs the updates to restart. &nbsp;So I then login to Windows 10 and
 go to load Diablo which requires the Battle.net application to load it. &nbsp;From there it tells me "Install" I'm like umm what is going on. &nbsp;So I go to my D:\Games and see that ALL of my games have been deleted. &nbsp;Baffled as to what has happened I call Microsoft
 for NOT a single person to understand what I'm saying. &nbsp;"Oh you just upgraded yes there is compatibility issue's lets system restore it" &nbsp;By default System Restore is not active on other drives other than C Drive unless you activate it. &nbsp;Anyone else have this
 issue? &nbsp;The following games I had installed where all gone.. out of 2TB I now have 1.78GB free which means they aren't "hidden" just gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>League of Legons</p>
<p>World of Warcraft</p>
<p>Aion</p>
<p>Lineage 2</p>
<p>Diablo</p>
<p>Heartstone</p>
<p>Starcraft 2/WIngs of Liberty</p>
<p>Hero's of the Storm</p>
<p>Half Life 2 all Episodes</p>
<p>Counter-Strike GO</p>
<p>Batman Origins</p>
<p>Batman Arkham Knight</p>
<p>Rift</p>
<p>Sim City Unlimted</p>
<p>Couple others..</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO as you can see that is well over 400GB worth of games that I've downloaded and had installed on the D:\ for Microsoft Updates to DELETE without cause.. No they weren't Pirated, as you can see 95%+ are games that are Online MMO's that require connecting
 to online servers. &nbsp;I mean seriously? &nbsp;No I don't have virus, trojan, malware. &nbsp;All other installed programs are fine from what I can see.. My 12 TB NAS server wasn't affected.. This PC and This PC only..</p>

</p><p>a couple of things come to mind</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. if they were pirated games, windows 10 is programmed to delete pirated software, and spy on you so they know, because windows 10 is horrible that way</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the files might still be around, it could be a filesystem mishap because of its own stupid rebooting problem, in which case you should run checkdisk and it may "find " the files</p>
<p>
</p><p>first find command prompt</p>
<p>right click it,</p>
<p>run as administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>a black box appears</p>
<p>type this command, the <em><strong>x</strong></em> represents the letter of the drive your games were on, replace it with the appropriate letter in the command
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>chkdsk <em>x</em>: /f</strong></p>
<p><strong>hit enter</strong></p>
<p>push <strong>y </strong>when prompted</p>
<p><strong>hit enter</strong></p>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm sure your not a gamer like myself or you would have known there is no way for you to Pirate Diablo 3 because it requires you to connect to the Battle.net servers which is owned by Blizzard the company maker. &nbsp;None of the games that were on the D:\ where
 Pirated at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for searching for the KB that was installed no way to do that because the support agent didn't listen to what I said about Restore not working for the D:\ drive by default and telling me to do it so it rolled back to 11/1 and the KB is no longer installed.
 &nbsp;Agents give random directions without understanding the problem and it doesn't solve anything at all. &nbsp;Microsoft has NO RIGHT to delete anything on my PC at all. &nbsp;I don't care if its pirated or not and for them to do so without my knowledge or consent is
 breaking the law by any means. &nbsp;Doesn't matter if they wiggle it into their TOS/EULA it is destroying property of someone else. &nbsp;Simple and plan fact of the law! &nbsp;Obviously 90% of the games listed almost require online connection to servers that are hosting
 the "game saves" per say on company servers they cannot in any way shape or form be "Pirated".</p>

            <p><strong>As for pirating</strong>, I ran pirated copies of diablo2 for years and played with my friends on and off battlenet (you could get away with it back then if you knew how) but i wasn't trying to accuse you of anything, it just came to mind because
 windows 10 can do that, which i disagree with as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>t</strong><strong>he microsoft "support engineers"</strong>, almost always give the same answers no matter what the problem or situation is, and ive seen many examples where the user cant even follow the advice given because the system does not boot
 up.&nbsp; <strong>I strongly suspect that they arent even people</strong>, but automated BOTS looking for an "answer" script to match with keywords in peoples posts. Either way they are almost always universally pathetic and un-helpful, so much so that the regulars
 on these boards all ignore them completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As for Microsoft breaking the law</strong>, i agree with you, its YOUR computer with YOUR data on it, they should NOT have the right to delete anything no matter what it is.</p>

            Question is not about Activation. Please read the question. My brand new Samsung Laptop came with Windows 8 installed. It activated when it set up. But how do I know it is actually registered to me? My laptop, my copy, registered to me.....thank you.

<h2>            Driver_power_state_failure</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I have been having difficulties with my laptop (Asus UX32VD) since 16/09/2013, after doing automatic updates the computer did not restart properly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I restart, shut-down or boot-up I sometimes get a blue screen&nbsp;(see dropbox link)&nbsp;or an error "DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE"&nbsp;(see dropbox link). After looking in event viewer I found there to be a critical error, it states the following "Event 41 Kernel-Power"
 and "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly". My laptop is also very slow to boot-up/shut-down and has started freezing sometimes since this
 problem started.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to solve the problem by refreshing my laptop, checking and updating drivers but to no success.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure if this matters but I have&nbsp;version&nbsp;BIOS 211 however I see that there are updated versions available "BIOS 203 UX32VDA" and "BIOS 214 UX32VD". Would you recommend updating this?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do you have any other suggestions as to how I can fix my computer?</div>
<div><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <b>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This error occurs if drivers do not handle power state transition requests properly, usually during one of the following procedures: shut down, suspending or resuming from standby, suspending or resuming from hibernation.</i><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there's no 4th parameter to run an !irp on (blocked IRP address), so I'd recommend enabling Driver Verifier to look for further device driver corruption and or conflicts:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</a><br />
<br />
I have quite the hunch on what driver(s) may be causing this, but I'd like to be sure.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

---------<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Although there is no clear indication TrendMicro OR DiskKeeper could be involved<br />
in the issue.<br />
<br />
---------<br />

<strong>5.</strong> If needed run Driver Verifier to see if that indicates a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods<br />

<strong>6.</strong> Use all the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />

<br />
Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(also Windows 7&nbsp;and 8)<br />

<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to<br />
see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card
<br />
or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : (Set VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft&nbsp;drivers<br />
- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Skype app lost contacts</h2>
                    <p>Skype Version installed on iPhone: 8.10.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put I cannot see my Skype contacts on my Skype app.</p>
<p>I go to Contacts - Skype or Contacts-ActiveNow, both of them are empty. It just keeps trying to Sync with my phone contacts, which is NOT what I want. I simply want my Skype contacts showing up on Desktop app, to show up on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I am SURE I've logged in with the same account. I have only one skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Rashad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Skype help page is a scam. I've tried EVERYTHING to get in touch with live-chat support. It just keeps pushing me into community help...</p>
<p>Very dissappointing. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Your contacts are tied on your account. They are saved on Skype's servers so you can access them across supported platforms and devices when you log in to your account. It might be that you are logging in to a different account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine whether you have multiple accounts, you can use this link:<span><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a> and enter your email address, this will show what Skype
 username that was inputted to your account.</span></p>

<h2>            Spacebar&#160;not&#160;working&#160;after&#160;Sony&#160;Vaio&#160;Care&#160;Update</h2>
                    <p>The space bar and right arrow key will not work on my Sony Vaio laptop. The only reason why I can type this with spaces is because I read that I can use Alt+255 to create a space. It is a pain to keep typing that every time I need to put a space in between
 words. I tried all the tricks. Uninstalling and reinstalling the keyboard, physically removing and putting back the key, the sticky note trick. Nothing has works. There is no water damage and I cleaned out any dust. The only thing I remember doing before it
 happened was updating the Sony Vaio Care. Please help! Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, I'm running on Windows 7 and the model number of my laptop is PCG-71913L.</p>

            <p>Maybe the keyboard is defective. You need to try an external USB keyboard to find out.</p>
<p>P.S. Atl+255 is a hard space which is not quite the same as a normal space (Alt+032). You can see the difference when you use it at the end of a line.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that this issue could be due to software corruption. We recommend performing the following methods:<br />
<br />
The methods are listed in order, so start with the first one, see if that fixes the problem, and then continue to the next one if it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Start your PC in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">safe mode</a></strong> and test the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
Isolate software corruption by running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">System File Checker</a></strong> tool.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Run an anti-malware program or <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/742778f2-6aad-4a8d-8f5d-db59cebc4f24/how-to-protect-your-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">turn on Windows Defender</a></strong>
 to check for any malware infection.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>Can&#39;t Uninstall Synaptics Driver after April 2018 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldroamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Uninstall Synaptics Driver after April 2018 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I would like to uninstall the Synaptics touch pad driver but when I try to do it from the apps section of settings it tells me that I must have administrative privileges and I need to log out and log back in as an admin. Problem is I am the administrator
 and there is only one account on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The long story is that I have an MSI laptop that uses MSI drivers for the trackpad. Windows occasionally installs an updated driver that disables the MSI drivers and gives only very basic functionality. However I can roll back to a previous version and my
 MSI driver comes back.&nbsp; However when I updated to the April 2018 Upgrade Windows installed the basic driver. Since there was no previous driver installed I cannot roll back. But I can't install the MSI driver as it says I have a newer one installed and need
 to uninstall that from the control panel. When I go to uninstall the driver from control panel I get the message that I need admin rights to do it.&nbsp; Any ideas how I can get this uninstalled and get the full featured driver installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I note is that in the apps section of Settings when I scroll to the synaptics driver the version that is shown is the latest version that MSI has available for the laptop.&nbsp; I believe that upon upgrade windows replaced some of the driver components
 such that something is corrupted or missing which prevents the normal uninstall from proceeding. This is just a guess on my part.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>With luck I think I have fixed it.&nbsp; What I did was to use IOBIT uninstaller to uninstall the Synaptics program. Then I went into device manager and told it to uninstall the device and delete the drivers. I put the laptop in airplane mode and rebooted. Once
 it came back up there were no Synaptics drivers installed just a generic mouse driver that the touch pad was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for using airplane mode was to prevent Windows from downloading and installing the newer driver which blocks the installation of the full feature MSI driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I was able to install the driver from MSI and regain the functionality that had been lost. In hindsight I am thinking I may not have needed IOBIT Uninstaller. I may have been able to just remove the device and delete the drivers from device
 manager, put the PC on airplane mode and then reboot and reinstall. I don't know that for sure but thought I would mention it in case anyone else is experiencing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This automatic device driver install is a real pain for things like this. There should be an easier way of blocking automatic driver updates.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am unable to open any application (e.g. excel) from start "search program and files" section. Whenever I try to open any application from start menu, it doesn't guide me to that particular application. I have rebuild the indexes from Indexing options
 as well but to no avail.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Request you to suggest a solution.</div>

            &nbsp; It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To
 get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

&nbsp; Microsoft has suggestions and offerings at <br />

- <br />
&nbsp;Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at <br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</a><br />
- <br />
&nbsp;If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.&nbsp; Click the box that says Show more restore points.
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `<br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the immediate response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Safe mode doesn't shows the Symantec protection. I am unable to run full scan from safe mode.</div>
<div>System restore is always an option but that will uninstall some important utilities that I can't afford to loose.</div>
<div><br />
<div>sfc/scannow shows system is not&nbsp;vulnerable to anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope you understand what I am trying to convey.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I'll again report the problem:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whenever I write any application name (mstsc or excel or notepad) on search of start button, it is not indexed directly to the application. The output is somewhat like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <p>&nbsp;It sounds like your system is seriously corrupted.&nbsp; If you haven't already backed it up, you should do so ASAP because it sounds like it could stop working at any time.&nbsp; I have Norton Security Suite on my laptop and when I boot into Safe Mode and click
 on it, it asks if I want to run a full system scan.&nbsp; As my byline says, if you haven't backed up your system, you'll be sorry.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; System restore is your best hope, and it may not work, given the state of your computer.&nbsp; You may have to restore it to factory
 settings.&nbsp; When you do get it working, you sure should back it up to an external hard drive.</p>

            This is a known server problem which started a few days ago. Outlook engineers are working on a fix, but there's no ETA yet for a solution. Please use webmail meanwhile.

<h2>            problem z pobraniem GTA San Andreas</h2>
                    
<p>Witam, próbowałem zakupić GTA San Andreas na moją konsolę, jestem zalogowany na swoje konto zarówno na komputerze jak i na konsoli, i za każdym razem gdy usiłuję kupić tą grę wyskakuje błąd - na komputerze mam informację "Zakupu nie można teraz zrealizować.
 Spróbuj ponownie później.", natomiast gdy próbuję przez konsolę wyskakuje mi z kolei błąd i kod stanu 80072746. Gra aktualnie kosztuje 14,75 zł już z VATem, przy czym nie udało mi się jej w dalszym ciągu zakupić. Zauważyłem również co mnie bardzo zaniepokoiło,
 iż po kilku próbach kupna sprawdziłem stan swojego konta w banku, i okazało się że nie dość że gry dalej nie pozwala mi kupić, to w dodatku dwukrotnie ściągnęli mi z konta po 3 zł, nie mam pojęcia za co... bardzo proszę o pomoc.</p>

<p>Region w opcjach konsoli a region konta to nie to samo. Region konta możesz zmieniać raz na 3 miesiące, a w konsoli bez konsekwencji ile chcesz. Z tego co widzę, po tych wszystkich "ułatwieniach" na stronie internetowej nie da się sprawdzić jaki aktualnie
 masz region. W zasadzie powinieneś wiedzieć, na jaki region zakładałeś konto lub na jaki migrowałeś, pewnie z takiego założenia wychodzi Microsoft. Możesz zajrzeć
<a href="https://account.live.com/SummaryPage?mkt=pl-PL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">tutaj</a>. Jeśli nigdy nie był zmieniany region konta, to powinien być taki jak podany na tej stronie. Nie jestem pewien, czy nie zmienia się automatycznie wraz z migracją konta xbox live,
 czy pozostaje taki jak na początku. W ostateczności możesz spróbować <a href="https://live.xbox.com/pl-PL/AccountMigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
zmienić region konta</a> na Polskę (o ile oczywiście jesteś aktualnie w Polsce). Jeśli taki jest właśnie region konta, zmiana nie powinna nastąpić.</p>
<p>Dane rozliczeniowe mają jakieś dziwne standardy, sam miałem z tym problemy. W ostateczności podałem 3 pierwsze cyfry numeru komórkowego jako kierunkowy, a dalej resztę i zaakceptowało.</p>

<p>Wszedłem na te linki i w tym pierwszym tam miałem złą datę urodzenia, regionu w ogóle nie miałem, ale uzupełniłem już to wszystko. W danych rozliczeniowych również skorzystałem z rady i wpisałem w nr kierunkowym 3 pierwsze cyfry mojego numeru. Mam nadzieję
 że to coś poprawi, póki co nie mam jak sprawdzić czy gra się pobierze ponieważ Microsoft mi znowu ściągnął kolejne 6 zł z konta, a miałem odliczone niecałe 20 właśnie na tą część GTA.. tak czy inaczej bardzo dziękuję za wszelką pomoc. A te pieniądze które
 MS ściąga po 3 zł z karty wiadomo kiedy one mogą wrócić z powrotem na konto?</p>

<p>Zależy od tego jak sprawnie działa twój bank. Skoro ciągle system próbuje pobrać te 3 zł, to pewnie nadal nawet nie doszła do nich pierwsza próba autoryzacji. Może jest jakiś problem na linii bank - system Microsoftu. Zawsze możesz skontaktować się z bankiem
 i zapytać, jak u nich wygląda sytuacja z tymi transakcjami. Prawdopodobnie mogliby nawet cofnąć wszystkie próby autoryzacji od ręki, ale nie wiadomo czy system Microsoftu nie próbowałby do skutku pobrać tego symbolicznego dolara. Może mogliby nawet "popchnąć
 dalej" autoryzację. Możesz spróbować to obejść. Jeśli masz kartę płatniczą, przypisz ją do swojego konta PayPal, a PayPal dodaj jako formę płatności w konsoli. PayPal pomaga obejść zgrzyty w systemie z niektórymi polskimi bankami, ale musisz mieć podpiętą
 kartę. Microsoft odrzuca PayPal bez kart.</p>

<p>vigilium, chyba się z Tobą nie zgodzę. Są przecież karty przedpłacone Xbox Live. Nigdy takowych nie używałem, bo mam podpiętą kredytówkę, ale z tego co mi wiadomo to można dzięki niej kupować gry, dodatki, itp.</p>

    <title>System restore keeps deleting the restore points automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budguinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            System restore keeps deleting the restore points automatically</h2>
                    <p>I have had numerous problems with my install of Windows 10 in that the restore point function doesn't work after a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got tired off fussing with the install and did a completely clean install to a newly formatted 2tb disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a windows 10 and still have the same damn problem with the restore points as I had before the install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem as my other four unanswered tickets will attest to is that the windows system, or restart or shutdown and restart will delete the restore points.&nbsp; This is idiotic in that I will never be able to recover from a system mishap...such as a corrupted
 system update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what is causing this and what is the fix.&nbsp; Please look at my other posts.</p>
<p>I have ran sfc /scannow.&nbsp; I have checked to see if the vss is running in both details and services.</p>
<p>I have 20% of the disk dedicated to VSS.</p>
<p>The system restore points continue to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate some help with this new and safer windows system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards,</p>

<p>bud - End of quote</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right.</p>
<p>Why should something that was not a problem with Windows 7 be a problem in Windows 10?</p>
<p>Also, the help section in Microsoft is more helpless than the users who posed the problem!!!!</p>
<p>The help section is only good in pushing the problem back to its users by telling them to try all sorts of input in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>They must remember that not all users are versed in programming, even simple ones and if they screwed up, they will not have the Restore Points to help them.</p>
<p>Which is the prime function of the Restore Point!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So, they are putting their users (customers) at risks!!!!</p>
<p>What sort of help are they offering then?</p>
<p>They should have restore points that work as well as the ones in Windows 7, if not what they are doing is not progress but regress.</p>
<p>I also suggest that users who are short-changed by these so-called System Engineers take up the matter with the highest echelon of Microsoft so that some butts will be kicked and an update to rectify this perennial problem can be done immediately instead
 of having such problems passed back to the users.</p>
<p>What a bunch of over paid, spineless creatures!!!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            rundll 32 problem and graphics</h2>
                    Not sure if they are related but I can not set my color scheme&nbsp;to anything but 4 bits and everytime at start up&nbsp; I get a rundll 32 error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Long story short son installed some beta game was having problems those techies told him to get rid of all his virus/firewall
 things and well computer crashed and colors went out the window. I reinstalled windows vista home premium and well the above errors occur.&nbsp; I have tried to go to nvidia to get my graphics back (did this once and worked before reinstalling windows) but wont
 now.<br />
the error message I get with rundll is below.&nbsp; I am guessing I need to get a new graphic card not sure if that will help with the dll problem or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried to delete this dll and then hopefully reinstall to no avail.&nbsp; any suggestions would be great.&nbsp;
 I will not be on&nbsp;this weekend should you need more information but hopefully I included enough to maybe get started on what I might be able to do<br />
