<h2>            Encryption</h2>
                    <p>When I encrypted a file or a folder in my computer, is my login password an encryption key that allows me to open the encrypted files after logging in? Is this the preventive measure that the person who steals my computer and starts it
 in safe mode will be denied access to this encrypted files? If I do online banking on a secure site, how is the key created and how the bank gets the key to decrypts the information I sent them? Please help me to understand this concept. It sounds too technical.
 There is something like someone the other side has to have the public key (the copy of the private key)&nbsp;to open the encrypted file or folder. I am asking for a clarity on that in layman terms.</p>

            <p>It works with encryption keys and encryption certificates, without the certificate the encrypted files cannot be decrypted.&nbsp; The EFS certificate is dependent on your user account and your password, on stand alone machines the certificate is usually stored
 locally so if someone can logon to your account they will generally be able to access your encrypted files but you can export and delete the certificate thus preventing anyone from accessing the files.&nbsp; In a domain environment the EFS certificate can be and
 is usually stored on the domain controller thus forcing users to authenticate on the domain controller before they can access the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following cannot be stressed enough:&nbsp; Be sure that you understand how EFS works before you encrypt your files an make sure that you save a copy of the EFS certificate in a secure location OR ELSE CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL END UP USING YOUR FILES!&nbsp; If
 you do not heed this advice you will end up being another one who will be had by the

<h2>            Windows 10 stopped finding my camera</h2>
                    My Canon Digital camera was detected by Windows 10 until last month, but today I received a message "Camera Not Detected".&nbsp; In the past when I connected the camera an ICON will appear and Windows software allows me to select my image(s). Now when I plug
 in the camera I hear bonks so windows knows it is there, but there is no automatic start and now my Canon software cannot detect the camera. &nbsp;&nbsp; I turned off my firewall. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Check your antivirus software
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />Select the Start  button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results. 
<br />Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers. 
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties. 
<br />Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.) 
<br />After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties. 
<br />Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again. 
<br />If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

<p><span>Jamshed Muhammad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I had already stopped my firewall, but that did not help. &nbsp; After trying different Canon and Microsoft options to open and transfer I discovered the following.&nbsp; My camera is connected, but Windows no longer displays
 a connected screen or allows me to select images to transfer. &nbsp; So, I went to "This Computer" and found my Canon was displayed as attached.&nbsp; I opened it and found two modules.&nbsp; I opened the DISP and found eight more entries although this camera contains over
 400 images.&nbsp; I clicked on the last entry and found my latest photos.&nbsp; I can view and modify them with paint, but all this it happens within the camera?&nbsp; So I copied and pasted them onto my desktop.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; I also discovered the Windows update stored a bunch of my photos in a Windows 8.1 folder that up to now was no longer available to me since I went to Windows 10??. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft should tell users when a change will be made and allow the user to schedule it.&nbsp; Also, inform them in advance about the content of the changes so there are no surprises. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There are many reports it does interfere with Chromium. I think the best thing you can do is to disable it for now.
<br />
<br />Also, if its affecting Edge Dev, you should file a bug report.
<br />
<br />In Edge Dev, click the Smiley face then file a bug report.

<h2>            Can&#39;t get to Logon screen and some Troubleshooting and Advanced Options are missing</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 in early July 2016, and up until today I've had no problems.&nbsp; No recent computer changes have been made. Unfortunately, as of this morning, my vintage Dell Inspiron 620 PC with Windows 10 got past the boot up stage, however it never
 got to the logon screen (Problem #1).&nbsp; It's stuck on the screen saver screen and won't respond to any actions.&nbsp; I used a USB disk to load the repair tool and was able to get into the "Troubleshoot" mode.&nbsp; Interestingly, "Advanced Options" was the only choice
 here - "Reset Your PC" was not available (Problem #2). In Advanced Options, the "Startup Settings" options was not available (Problem #3).&nbsp; Unfortunately without those options I am unable to boot up in safe mode.&nbsp; Also, "System Restore" tells me there were
 no restore points created. (For some reason I thought that restore points happened automatically – upon further investigation I was wrong). In addition, I had never created a "System Image" - my bad. The "Go Back to Previous Rebuild" option said that it ran
 into a problem and wouldn't be able to take me back to a previous rebuild. The "Start up Repair" option told me one time that it could not repair any problems and the next few times it stated that it was analyzing and repairing disk errors; however, after
 a long time it just rebooted and went back to the pre-logon screen saver mode.&nbsp; I tried the msconfig command in the "Command Prompt" options (after changing the drive from X to D) but no luck. Does anybody have any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

In the Kernel2K dir/folder, <em>e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Ideazon\ZEngine\Kernel2K</em>, rename every file that starts with Alpham or alpham to something else. (<em>ex. Alpham1.sys =&gt; Merc1.sys</em>).
<em>I changed mine to Alpham1KB.sys</em></li><li>5. Open the renamed *.inf file in a text editor (Notepad++ <em>C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe)</em> and do a similar find and replace

            I don't normally suggest using third-party sites for device drivers, but apparently there are Sony Windows drivers for this camera so you have to compromise.&nbsp; See

<h2>            Software needed for Microtek Scanmaker 8700 using Windows 7</h2>
                    Microtek no longer supports with software my Scanmaker 8700 on Windows 7.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen suggested to download Windows XP 32 bit driver, but I have 64 bits, and I have also read that this product is not for home computers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are websites that advertise downloads, but I'm afraid to try them because I recently had a virus.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Microtek Scanmaker was not listed in my Devices and Printers after a technician from PC-Helpers came to get rid of the virus. &nbsp;Also, there are now icons for hardware that I do not have. &nbsp;I'm told by the technician who cleared the virus that he did not
 "touch the equipment", although he did ask me at the time what kind of scanner I have. He says that the virus must have corrupted my scanner.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas what websites can be trusted to provide me with a download for the software/driver I need?&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            I got a HP 15 with Windows 10 on line and found out it does not have Bluetooth.</h2>
                    I didn't realize my computer didn't have Bluetooth, until I tried to connect it with an outside device. There isn't an icon, nor any indication that was is in the system. I did a Device check and it didn't show on the computer listing. Like it was never
 even in the hardware at all!&nbsp; Windows 10s are all suppose to have Bluetooths right?<br />

            Bluetooth is a hardware component machine may or may not come with.
<br />Basically not all machines have them.
<br />So if you are not seeing it then your machine probably does not have it.
<br />But you can purchase a bluetooth external device so you can use bluetooth.
<br />Something like the link below.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Video Card Problem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a Dell&nbsp;Inspiron 660 running Windows 8.1 with Intel HD Graphics. I recently added an AMD Radeon HD 7750 graphics card which installed and worked fine for the 1 monitor that I use. However, if I right click on the desktop and select "Screen Resolution"
 it shows I have 2 displays. My working monitor is identified as monitor 2 (running on the AMD Radeon HD Graphics card). Monitor 1 is showing as a Generic Non-PnP Monitor running on a Microsoft Basic Display Driver. What is this? I don't have a 2nd monitor
 set up. I can't seem to get rid of this phantom Monitor 1 showing in Windows. Any ideas? Any help would me much appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Under Display Adapters in Device Manager, I see the AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series, and the Intel HD Graphics, I don't even see a&nbsp;Microsoft Basic Display Driver which is even stranger.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Ed<br />

<p><strong>To disable:</strong> In Device manager right clik on Intel HD Graphics and disable it.<br />

<br />Connect your External Hard drive to your PC
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the left, click Pictures
<br />
<br />On the right, find the photos you want to transfer to the external drive
<br />
<br />Right  click those photos or their containing folder and choose 'Send To' - your external drive will be bottom of the 'Send To' list
<br />
<br />That's It, wait for those to transfer across . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 changing assigned USB drive letters after reboot</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I am having problems with Windows 10 64 pro reassigning drive letters on a USB memory card reader. &nbsp;Specifically it is a Dynex model DX-CRD12 internal all in one card reader. &nbsp;It interfaces to my computer through an internal &nbsp;USB interface. &nbsp;Using the disk
 management tool I assigned drive letters to each of the four memory card readers. &nbsp;On this Windows 10 computer during a cold startup Windows will reassign the drive letters which conflict with my network drives. &nbsp;This requires me to go in and change the drive
 letters again. &nbsp;I have seen several posts on the Internet with others having the same problem even with different OS's. &nbsp;One person suggested making the change directly in the registry which I have tried but that seems to make no difference. &nbsp;I have been using
 this specific card reader on this same computer running Windows 7 64 pro for years and never had any problems. &nbsp; I also have this same card reader installed on another very similar Windows 10 64 pro computer and it does not seem to be doing it. They are both
 Asus motherboards but slightly different models.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

</p><p>I have tried both of these things as well as others and so far I still have the problem. &nbsp;I have been in contact with the USB card reader and the only thing they could suggest is a possible driver issue. &nbsp;I tries updating the driver using the motherboard

<h2>            Vista Basic &#58; Windows update failure &#58; Hp Compaq presario CQ40</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using Campaq presario CQ40 with windows vista basic edition. There are few windows updates which<br />
&nbsp;were downloaded into my system but failed to install properly. On rebooting, the system says that "Updates were not configured properly and reverting the changes. Please do not turn off the system" (or something similar meaning)<br />
<br />
How do I get rid of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts when you try to install an update in Windows Vista

            Vista SP2 installed on my system.<br />
<br />
The All the updates were installed without any issues until Sep-09. The system was not in use (disconnected from internet) for two months since Oct-09.&nbsp; On turning it on again, it had downloaded the latest updates and asked for a reboot. On rebooting (before
 getting the login screen ), the system displays a message stating the updates were not configured properly and the changes are getting reverted. After about 10 minutes of time, the system reboots again smoothly and then takes me to login screen. Again it identified
 updates, again reboot, again reverting and the cycle goes on.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need any more details.<br />

            Hi Tony.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />At any time you can rescue your files to external flash or USB hard drive, by accessing the Command Prompt in Advanced Startup Options and following this guide:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can then use the same Options to try to Startup Repair, System Restore or if those don't work do the Reset, which will also offer to save your files.  
<br /> 
<br />You can even preserve your files if you need to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  Instead of formatting or deleting partitions at that illustrated step you would instead just highlight the C partition and click next, which will reinstall WIndows but archive your files in C:\Windows.old for later retrieval.  
<br />
<br />So there's no reason to lose your files, but your  files should always be backed up if you value them at all because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn on File History to keep your files backed up incrementally to external hard drive.  However I would also use one of the other methods above to be safest:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-windows-10-file-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/how-to-create-an-image-backup-in-windows-10-and-restore-it-if-need-be.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/...</a>
<br />The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
In Windows Mail, all mails coming in are dumped into one In-box. You don't need to switch accounts because there is nothing to switch.<br />
The only way to tell which e-mail was sent to which account is by setting up the COLUMNS.....<br />
Open Windows Mail &gt; menu bar, View &gt; Columns &gt; A drop-down box will appear, scroll to find Account. You can decide where&nbsp; the Account will appear on the Column by moving it up or down ( right side of the same box.) &gt; click OK when done.<br />
You could have it appear in the column like this :<br />
(Paper clip )- From ( sender )&nbsp;- Account ( to which account )&nbsp;- Received (date) - Subject - size<br />

<h2>            Intel GMA 950 graphics causes dark screen issues on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently installed a Windows 8 Pro x64 partition on my notebook computer. (I did a completely fresh and clean install)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system works really well, and runs extremely fast.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before I installed the drivers, Win 8 worked perfectly, but of course the display was not at full resolution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After I installed the Intel GMA 950 (appears in Windows Device manager as GMA 945 series) Windows 7 x64 driver (there is no Win 8 one) from Intel's website, the screen worked at full resolution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when I turn on the computer, it boots up normally, but once the blue Windows logo disappears, the screen backlight turns completely off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It then goes to the Lock screen (Picture of Seattle, Washington and a Clock), but there is no backlight, and the contrast adjust keys do absolutely nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To get the backlight to work, I have to hold down the "alt" key after the Windows logo appears, and the screen goes completely dark, and then turns back on again. Once the computer is started, Windows 8 works perfectly and is very responsive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every component except the video card works perfectly using the vendors drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The contrast adjustment keys work perfectly after "Alt" is held at startup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last night, the Windows Update application found an optional update for this Intel graphics chip, so I installed the official Microsoft version and uninstalled the Intel version (Intel said all future drivers will be MS Windows update ones, since they
 are not supporting this chip on Win 8), and yet the problem still persists.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are other people having issues with the Intel GMA 950 (also known as 945) series chips?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Should I wait for this behavior to be fixed in a Windows update, or downgrade to the 32-bit Windows 8, since this card worked perfectly in 32-bit XP? I also found out that there are 32 bit custom drivers from the computer vendor, but the 64-bit ones are
 from Intel and Microsoft.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for the help</div>
<div><br />

<p><br />
Sounds like the drivers you have that you like are not signed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supposedly you can't have unsigned 64-bit drivers unless you use the boot option which says to override that fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't know if that means that you would have to use that procedure
 on every boot or if there is a way of making that choice persist.&nbsp;&nbsp; First you should try using the boot option manually to see if that works as a workaround.&nbsp;&nbsp; (In fact, I just realized that as long as you don't do a full shutdown after that that you could
 probably keep restarting without having to do anything about&nbsp;unsigned drivers anyway.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

            <p>Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue was actually resolved by a Windows update I installed this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the machine seems to work perfectly, and has been working this way for 2 days so far. My laptop now works like any other Windows PC out there in that I no longer have to play around with it while booting to get the screen to be readable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen is now&nbsp;at full resolution (1280x800), and the hardware acceleration seems to be working when I watch videos online. Brightness control keyboard keys work, and so does the vendor's brightness control program in their custom control panel, but the
 sun icon in the Charms menu says "unavailable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the basic driver from Windows update. Intel does not have an official Windows 8 Driver for this graphics chip, so Windows Update is better supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, I have created a restore point in case if the issue comes back from another update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those that are having the problem, this course of action may fix it</p>
<p>1. Start up computer</p>
<p>2. Hold "alt" down after the blue Windows logo disappears and release it when the Start screen appears</p>
<p>3. When you get to the Start screen (has Live tiles on it), type "Optional", click "Settings" in the search menu, and then click "Install optional updates"</p>
<p>4. Click check for updates, and install all of them</p>
<p>5. Now, hopefully, you can boot your computer by just turning it on, and your screen will work perfectly.</p>
<p>6. For safe measure, disable adaptive brightness in the power settings under "Advanced Plan Options"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for the response, and thanks to Microsoft for resolving this issue in an update.

<p>Hello AliAhmed7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use Skype for Business, you need a Skype for Business or Lync account—typically the same user name and password you use when signing in at work or school.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Skype for Business account, it means an Office 365 for Business account with Skype for Business online license. About Lync account, it is an account in a Skype for Business server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to this article to know more details: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sign-in-to-skype-for-business-f104e76c-cef3-4468-8065-d75ea157e58d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I suspect that some incompatible driver is causing this issue. If you are able to get past this error and login to your PC, then I would suggest you to boot the PC and safe mode and check fi you are able to login. Refer to this article to boot the PC in
 Safe mode with networking. Once you have logged into your PC, check and update all your drivers, restart the PC and check if the issue persists.</p>

            I make the message dissapear re installing all drivers from the driver's CD that comes with the laptop. Doing this solves a lot of problems related with drivers compatibility.<br />

            Presumably you have a motherboard that uses Nvidea chipset and lan controlers, visit your motherboard site to obtain the chipset and Lan drivers. Do NOT use winupdate for drivers

                    <p>I would suggest you open a new instance of SSMS for this...</p>
<ol>
<li>Open SSMS</li><li>Open a saved .SQL file saved to your Google Drive via g:\</li><li>Do a query (can be as simple as you like).</li><li>Make a small change to the file (add and remove a space).</li><li>Press Save button or Ctrl+S and watch SSMS crash and restart.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I've had it do that in all of SQL2016, v17 and v18/next...</p>

<h2>            &#39;your pc ran into an error and needs to restart&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently i bought a windows 8.1 pc as an upgrade to my laptop. The pc is fantastic and i really enjoy using it but unfortunatley at random times when i am using it it will freeze for a short time and then say 'your pc ran into an error and needs to restart'.
 The pc then restarts and comes up with a screen that says something like choose a boot device or something. I dont know what to do there so i just turn off my pc by holding the power button then turn it back on and it is working normally again. This is really
 annoying and i would like to fix this issue if i can. It happens usually about once a day but it sometimes doesnt happen.</p>

            <p>Hi Hugo, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that you are facing issues with your new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do need the complete error message regarding the Boot device not found to diagnose the cause of this issue.
</p>
<p>We would also require the event viewer logs to collect details of the performance error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below to open Event viewer:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press “<strong>windows key + X</strong>”</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>System and Security</strong></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>,

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For reference, you can refer to the link to check information related to Event Viewer logs:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-information-appears-in-event-logs-event-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-information-appears-in-event-logs-event-viewer</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: This article also applies for Windows 8.1. The steps are different to open Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I would suggest you to run a disk check and see if you are able find any anomalies with your hard drive. Please refer to the article below to run the chkdsk command.</p>
<p><strong><span><br />

<br />
Note: Please Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong>, type <strong>CMD</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong> to run the command Prompt.<br />
<br />
(Use <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> followed by <strong>chkdsk /r</strong>)</span></p>
