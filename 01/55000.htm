<h2>            Wireless internet takes a while to connect after sleep or hibernation&#63; Already changed power management settings for wireless</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I have a Dell XPS 17. I bought it last week. <br />
<br />
My internet config:<br />
<br />
Intel Centrino Wireless N 1030 adapter.<br />
<br />
I've already changed the power management settings for the wireless adapter to disable 'Allow this computer to turn of this device to save power'. Having looked at other threads i've also done this for the USB ports. The drivers have been updated to the latest
 intel drivers: 14.3.0.0<br />
<br />
Whenever I put my PC into sleep mode or hibernation upon resume it does not automatically connect to the internet and when I select the wireless network it takes a long time to connect, atleast 2-3 minutes. It normally displays 'windows is taking along time
 to connect'. <br />
<br />
The network is selected to connect automatically but it doesnt after sleep mode. <br />
<br />
Everything works fine when I shut down and power on as normal. Just not in sleep mode!<br />

                    <p>Hi, &nbsp;In the latest suite of Windows updates I was having repeated problems with them failing to install after 'restart'. &nbsp;I finally resorted to selecting and installing 1 at at time and they have now installed except for what appears to be the problem file
 &nbsp;the KB2800095 file. &nbsp;I have tried over a dozen times and everytime encounter the same issue...failure to configure on reboot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?</p>

</p><p>You should check for malware. Error Code: 8007005 has been regularly fixed by running Malwarebytes in recent months. If it is not malware then you have a permissions issue, which could be more difficult to diagnose and resolve.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can
 lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

                    Hey everyone, I've been having this problem on my computer for about 2 months now, but I haven't really had the time to fix it until now. This crashing is starting to become incredibly frequent, around once every 1-2 hours for the most part. I'm not quite
 sure how to decipher this error report, but hopefully someone here can.&nbsp; Let me know if you need any additional computer information, and I will provide it asap.&nbsp; Here is a skydrive link to the dmp files: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=F03959AD5A8F5FD7!108&amp;authkey=!AGE8pGeMcwJM0qU&nbsp;

Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><font color="#FF0000"><b>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.</b></font></em></em></div>
<span>If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.</span><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the
 RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates, or new drivers - NOTHING
 AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the
 machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong
 with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

<strong>2.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when
<br />
possible - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies,<br />
clear the vents, and ensure the fans are working. Try adding a small fan to reduce the<br />
effects of heat. Keep in mind that heat related does not always mean excessive heat since<br />
a component could be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below - pat attention to the FATAL implications<br />
above and those indicated below.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>&nbsp;

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to
<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>This means that the processor sent out a read request to L0 cache, and there was a delay in return (cache miss or invalid cache data).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -

<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>The <i><b>only</b></i> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Inbox only shows unread mail</h2>
                    I run Office 2007 on my XP platform. Today suddenly the Outlook Inbox only shows the unread mail in the Inbox. The unread folder includes other unread mail as well, which is correct. Please assist me in restoring the Inbox folder to show all mail in that
 folder, whether it was read or not.

<h2>            Windows 10 ... not worth the trouble&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    First of all let me send out a huge thank you to Microsoft for messing up my pc!! I have a gateway all in one pc and fell for the free download of Windows 10. Free? Why is that? Are we all guinea pigs??? After the download completed my computer worked
 great for about an hour. I shut down my pc for the night and when I attempted to turn it on the next morning, I get nothing but a black screen. &nbsp;I have read numerous threads which prove useless to me. First of all I don't even have a mouse cursor on my screen,
 just black! And most other threads say to unplug the monitor, blah blah blah! My pc is an all in one so unplugging the monitor is not an option. I did get the thing to go to a repair type screen one time but everything I clicked on came back with some kind
 of error message! So yeah! Thank you Microsoft! This is ridiculous! I really hope that I don't have to end up paying to have this issue resolved. Hey Microsoft people, maybe next time you want to have people sign up for a free

<p>
</p><p>And if you think there's something unique about Windows 10's ability to mess up a computer: A computer can get totally messed up from much less than an operating system upgrade. I know because I've done it plenty of times. But I also backup, so when I do
 myself in I just restore a backup and everything is back to the way it was.</p>

 though many many people are having issues. Not only the black screen issue but multiple other issues as well!&nbsp;

<h2>            MOVIE MAKER - TRANSITIONS PROBLEM</h2>
                    Im using Windows Live Movie Maker &amp; when I first created my movie the transitions were solid black(you couldnt see the next full picture till the transition was complete), I saved my project then came back to it &amp; now my transitions look transparent where
 you see the entire picture with just a light gray overlay instead of an actual transition. I have tried everything to fix it, including uninstalling &amp; reinstalling the program, sat on the phone with microsoft customer service for 2 hours which was no help
 at all. Someone please tell me they know how to fix this problem before I go bananas.<br />

<p>How does your project look as you playback the movie in the preview?&nbsp; The triangles on the right represent the transition, but aren't how the final playback will look.&nbsp; You need to check it looking at the actual preview on the left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if as you play it back, you are seeing a transparency, there is a bigger problem.</p>

            <p>Hi fet_211,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We are here to assist you with the similar concern as with taliashaw. In addition to what considerate_guy have asked, could we know what you mean by "<em>Today, they are gone</em>"? Are you referring to the created movie/project
 that is now missing/deleted&nbsp;on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue wherein the transition effect is not properly working, I recommend that you:</p>

a. Click on <strong>Start</strong> button and type <strong>dxdiag</strong> in the Search programs and files box and press

c. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.

            I have exactly the same problem with the transitions.&nbsp; My project was fine but a few days later I added more video.&nbsp; Now in the preview pane the transitions are transparent and when viewed in full screen they do not appear at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reveal transitions
 still work ok but the other types don't.&nbsp; Looking on the forum one solution seems to be to make sure moviemaker is up to date but I&nbsp;see someone has tried this and it didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;My computer has done some automatic updates lately is it anything to do with
 that?&nbsp; It's extremely frustrating as I am ready to burn my project now after all the hard work.&nbsp; Can anyone help please?&nbsp;

            <p>I have found a solution to my problem.&nbsp; As the problem has appeared since I last used moviemaker which was only a few days ago I checked to see what automatic updates had been done.&nbsp; I removed the update for Microsoft Windows KB2670838 which updated on 29/03/2013
 and the transitions are working just fine again.&nbsp; Don't know what the update was for and whether I should have removed it but it solved my transition problem!&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked for me anyhow.</p>

            Hi Francis_S, I had trouble with my transition. I read your advice and skeptically tried upgrading to 2012 from 2011. And now it is just perfect. In fact I am making a movie with all pics of my nephew since birth for his 1st b'day. I thought I just missed
 it but you saved me at the last minute. I owe u a big one..

<p>External hard drive not responding ...??<br />
I just bought a My Passport and i have an Windows 10 on my HP laptop . Alright so i cant seem to find where i can transfer my files. It doesn't show up in the "my computer" spot but when i go to devices and its there and the troubleshoot tells me that its fine.
 So is my computer the problem or the person in front of it? I have three other external hard drives that show up on the computer but this new one isn't doing anything. This is my second one in a week since I thought the first one was a problem, but this is
 doing the same thing. If I need to format it how do I? The other three popped up on it's own I didn't have to do anything. This one isn't doing anything!!!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Google Chrome Saved Password, Requested Account Password But Password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Google Chrome Saved Password, Requested Account Password But Password Is False</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I want to ask<br />
Yesterday I was upgraded to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, I happen to want to open Steam on laptop, but I was asked to login again. I forgot the password, but I remember if the password is stored in Google Chrome.<br />
<br />
After I open Google Chrome, there brings up a dialog box like the photo below. If I select "More Choices" then there is my account, I click my account and prompted the account password. But every time I type the password is always said wrong, wrong, and wrong.<br />
<br />
How did it happen? What is the solution? Though the password is correct, and able to login Microsoft account and laptop<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Microsoft Mahjong can generate scores for me of 38,000. Does this make sense using the traditional scoring?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a rookie, I'm not familiar with the tile names.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; So I did look into this a little and although I could not find the exact scoring for Microsoft Mahjong,&nbsp;</p>
<p>After watching several videos I did find that it is a bit different then traditional. It does seem that 38,000 could be a given score though.</p>

            I've been using the paid features for years, and I can still use Skype. But suddenly, I can't use the paid features. My money is now no longer any good there. But there is no method to "fix" what isn't broken, and no way to recover my paid features, and
 no way to recover my money. Can you possibly understand how angry that would make someone?&nbsp;

<p>My controller got electrocuted when I touched the bottom of it (where the keypad connects to). It is a wired controller.</p>
<p>I've only used it for about a week and already broke it. I cannot have it replaced anymore because it has already passed its warranty period. Please provide me a link that shows me how to fix it, or if possible, give me instructions on how to bring it back

<p>Static electricity is extremely detrimental to electronics of all kinds, and your controller may not make it back from the shock. &nbsp;Turn off your console and unplug the controller. &nbsp;Make sure you are free of any built up static electricity by touching a metal
 object nearby. &nbsp;Then plug the controller in and turn on our Xbox console. &nbsp;If your controller works, then consider yourself lucky. &nbsp;If not, you will unfortunately need to buy a new controller.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your attention, I think I have solved my problem, today, by installing from a recovery usb I made and choosing the remove my data option at install. This gave me back 5gb I couldn't account for and therefore possibly enough space to do the
 update automatically....about 11gb free&nbsp;altogether. The download is being performed at the moment... Have you not noticed your update servers being drained by all similar pc's being in this download loop....a friend has already given me his pc which is in
 the same state to be attended to, so I can try your suggested solution on that one. I will&nbsp;reply with an update!</p>

<br />
<br />
Last Month (too busy with work) we had a thunderstorm and lost power. System has a surge protector. I am certain there wasn't a power spike because the other 4 computers are working.<br />
<br />
Computer is HP Pavilion Elite m9340f running W7 64.<br />
<br />
Startup repair could not repair, here is the info:<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name: Startup Repair Offline<br />

<br />
OS Ver. 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
Local ID 1033<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, I ran chkdsk /r It found no problems.<br />
<br />
Next, a System Restore, completed successfully.<br />
<br />
Restarted, it acts normal for a couple of seconds then BSOD:<br />
<br />
It says remove any new hard drive or controller, run chkdsk (I have already run chkdsk and there are no errors). Or it says it could be a virus.<br />
<br />
No new hard disk and I know there is no virus as the computer has all the necessary anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
Here is the info:<br />
<br />
<br />
STOP: 0x0000007B (0xFFFFF880009A9928,0xFFFFFFFFC0000034,0X0000000000000000,0X0000000000000000)<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, I ran bootrec.exe /fixmbr, bootrec.exe /fixboot, bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd and bootrec.exe /scanos from the command prompt. The last coming back with Total identified Windows installations: 0. Not sure if I actually ran it on the C: drive as the prompt
 was x:\windows\system32&gt; .<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 205, 1)">What I have done to ensure there is not a problem with the hard drive is to run the Western Digital HD test (using Hiren's Boot CD v. 15.2), it
 completed without any errors (I ran the complete test).&nbsp; Next, to also ensure that there were no memory&nbsp;issues I also ran Memtest 86+ v.4.2 (also Hiren's) and received a "Pass Complete".
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 205, 1)">My thoughts are there are corrupted Windows System Files, I booted the computer using the Windows DVD and was able to get to the command prompt.&nbsp;
 Once there I changed to C:\ and attempted to run sfc /scannow.&nbsp; I received "There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. Restart windows and run sfc again".&nbsp; The problem is I can only get to the command prompt using the windows DVD.&nbsp;
 When I restart with the DVD nothing happens.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>System is acting as if it is trying to boot from some other device - not from the hard drive. &nbsp;Is a USB memory stick connected? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the BIOS, temporarily change the order of boot devices so that the hard drive is the first booting device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, a surge is incoming to every household appliance. &nbsp;Are all damaged? &nbsp;Of course not. &nbsp;To do damage, the surge finds an appliance or a few appliances that also make a better connection to earth. &nbsp;Those damage appliances are protecting all others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using a power strip protector, then damage can be made easier. &nbsp;Protection means a surge is earthed BEFORE entering the building. &nbsp;So a completely different device (also called a surge protector) must be installed at the service entrance and connected
 low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to earth ground. &nbsp;Only then do power strip protectors do anything useful and not cause house fires.</p>

<p>You have assumed it was a &nbsp;high voltage; not a blackout that caused damage. &nbsp;Well, even that is only speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also speculation is that underground wires are protected. &nbsp;Clearly not. &nbsp;Surge enters on underground wires just as easily as on overhead. &nbsp;A Tech Note demonstrates this:</p>

</p><p>Every incoming wire (overhead, underground, even antenna) must be properly earthed. &nbsp;Not earthing as required for human safety (as you only assumed). &nbsp;Earthing that both meets and exceeds requirements only defined for human safety. &nbsp;In some cases, that earthing
 does not exist without a 'whole house' protector to make the low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even wall receptacle safety ground are not earth ground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what that drive is waiting for to finish. &nbsp;A quick glance at many things tried should have cleared that defect. &nbsp;From everything I can see (and the disk drive manufacturer's diagnostic was a critically important fact), the disk drive should
 be OK and bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, you could buy a second drive, load Windows on it, and then execute diagnostics to the suspect drive as a slave drive. &nbsp;At least that will make possible data recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I do not see anything that says you have effective protection. &nbsp;A generator, underground wires, and earthing that only meets code requirements does nothing for appliance protection from surges. &nbsp;You must have a properly earthed 'whole house' protector,
 some other connection requirements, and telco and cable 'provided for free' protection must also meet those earthng requirements. &nbsp;If you have that all properly earthed, then a surge did not do damage. &nbsp;Do not confuse earthing for transistor protection with
 earthing for human protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only obsolete filesystems (from well over 20 years ago) have files corrupted by blackouts. &nbsp;If your bootsector was restored by those Windows programs, then that BSOD should not exist. &nbsp;Implied is something defective in the hard drive interface hardware.
 &nbsp;But the drive's diagnostic should have detected that. &nbsp; Leaving shotgunning as an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Learn if a new drive can be installed / loaded to boot - so as to confirm all hardware (except for the suspect drive) is good. &nbsp;Then you can also recover data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that its power system is defective. &nbsp;Normal is for a defective power system to still boot (for example) diagnostics. &nbsp;But fail as more devices demand power. &nbsp;To answer that requires a meter, minutes of labor, and some requested instructions.
 &nbsp;Since any good part can be made to act defective due to a defective power 'system' (which is more than just a PSU).</p>

</p><p>What I have done is to remove the hard drive from that computer and I connected it to the one I am on now.&nbsp; As I suspected \ knew the drive is working correctly as a slave.&nbsp; It is listed as E:\ , all directories are there.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kenneth Martin1943,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Communities. From the problem description I understand that you are not able to perform a system restore. Before starting with the troubleshooting steps,
 provide the following information for the better understanding of the issue:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Are you using any third party security software?</span></li><li><span>Why are you performing a system restore?</span></li></ul>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Disable the
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">security software</a></b> temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should
 not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to attacks the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Run the
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>System File Checker</span></b></a><b><span>
</span></b><span>(SFC) scan to fix any corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>
<br />

<h2>            Laptop&#39;s screen would come back on when I come near&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've owned this laptop for almost two months now and when I walk away from the laptop the screen would go to black and it would go to sleep after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when i leave my laptop and walk away from it for a couple minutes(under 10 mins) it would turn to black but when i come back to the laptop without touching anything, my laptop's screen goes back on. I've noticed it'll go back on when I'm in the webcams
 range of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very uncertain if this is supposed to happen or this is one of windows 8 features. And my apologies in advance if i weirdly worded this out.</p>

            <p>Hi DioVA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description your computer goes to sleep after 10 minutes. This means the time which you have set for your computer to sleep is 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that when you come near to your laptop within this 10 min then the computer get back on without touching anything. I think this could be due to webcam. As the webcam is running in the background so, as soon as you come in front of this
 your computer gets turned on. This is because webcam is a part of your computer which starts working as soon as you come in front of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to clarify, you may&nbsp;turn&nbsp;off the&nbsp;webcam for some time and then check the status of your issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with this workaround and we will be happy to assist you further with the troubleshooting part.</p>
<p>
