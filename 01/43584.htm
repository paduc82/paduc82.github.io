<h2>            Unable to join Call of Duty&#58; Modern Warfare 3 games</h2>
                    
<p>This issue began on Sunday, 4/29/2012; at 4:30 P.M. I had to get off to do my homework and when I got back on at 10:00 P.M. I wasn't able to play. At first I joined a friends party and we waited in the lobby and he had to stop playing so I left the lobby,
 during which it kicked me from Xbox LIVE and froze the game. I restarted my Xbox and tried again, he had returned so I joined his party and we started searching for a game in Drop Zone, around &gt;100ms I was disconnected from Xbox live. After that I would occasionally
 receive a message stating, "Communication with the Xbox LIVE servers has been interrupted..."; the good old, "You have been disconnected from Xbox LIVE."; and then the occasional, "The servers for the game are temporarily unavailable (cont.)" Frustrated, I
 decided to try again on Monday, where the problem continued to persist. On Monday I reset my modem, switched between wireless and wired connections, cleared my system cache and waited for the lobby information to load before starting to search for a game (all
 suggestions that I found through Google). Also under advice from my father I attempted to play a match of Black Ops which had the same issue. Although, my parents are divorced and I travel between their houses daily; the Xbox at my mother's house has been
 able to run the same disc with the same profile (USB drive that I purchased formatted for Xbox's) smoothly and without any connection issues. The issue only occurs at my father's house and it apparently has nothing to do with either the disc, account, or internet
 (Netflix works and Connection tests return positive every time, also all other devices connected to the internet work fine).</p>
<p>Note: I have been able to join a few games, maybe 1/50 times, but I always receive, "You have been disconnected from Xbox LIVE," within 3 minutes of entering the lobby. Also, any kills/save data that I acquire during the games that I play before being disconnected
 is erased; I know this because beforehand I was about 2000 experience away from ranking up to 77. I acquired 6 kills in a game of Search and Destroy before I was disconnected; I leveled while playing the match but was returned to rank 76 when I reconnected
 to Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or help would be much appreciated and I look forward to any constructive responses.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>A while back I had an issue where I could play on Xbox live for a week or two, with similar issues, all other devices were fine, including LoveFilm, Youtube, iPods and laptops.
</p>
<p>I got in touch with my ISP and was told that there were works going on nearby which could cause interruptions, but after they had finished I had issues. The issue was related to my router and the information being sent to it. To be specific some of the values
 were way higher than they should be, and when on my Xbox it spiked.</p>
<p>I would recommend contacting your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and if they have no issues or information tell them your issues and request a technician if they cannot help over phone.
</p>
<p>This is what I recommend if no one else can offer any information.</p>
<p>Hope it gets resolved.</p>
        </p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The MW3 servers have been acting quirky since the latest update. It takes forever to get into a match if you have the DLC enabled. A few times my party has been kicked and disconnected for no reason at all. It let us back in right
 away though. So keep in mind the issue may not be on your end. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Have you tried any other games? Are you having the same online issue with them? If not then I would say it is an issue with MW3 and you could try contacting IW/Activision about it to see what, if anything, they are doing to correct
 it or wait it out. <br />

<p>I do not have the DLC or Elite and the problems began spontaneously, no update came up when I had got back on Sunday and before that it was acting normally. As I said in the original post I tried Black Ops and had an almost identical issue connecting to
 games. Today I am going to bring my Xbox to my mother's house to see if the issue is with the internet rather than the Xbox as well as try to see if any sort of issue has arisen in my area from my ISP.</p>

<p>After testing my Xbox at my mother's house, I found out there were no issues with the Xbox and it was purely an issue with the internet. When I returned to my dad's house, I tried again and it disconnected again, so I reset my modem AND router for an extended
 period of time and when I got back on matchmaking it was working fine. Thank you for all your suggestions, my problem has been resolved.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that you were able to get the command prompt, so give this a try...</p>
<p>There is a easier way to do this, but sometimes when you have multiple partitions, the .CMD can't find the right one... I haven't personally tried this, but have received replies that it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>a. Boot the computer using theWindows 8 bootable DVD. ( or Repair Disk...or your Win 7 disk, whatever you used)<br />
b. On the ‘Windows Setup’ wizard click on ‘Next’ and click on ‘Repair your computer’.<br />
c. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose.<br />
d. Click on ‘Troubleshoot’ then click on ‘Advanced Option’ and then click on ‘Command Prompt’.<br />
e. Type these commands on the Command Prompt:<br />
bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup <br />
c:<br />
cd boot<br />
attrib bcd –s –h –r <br />
ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old<br />
bootrec /RebuildBcd<br />
(Press Enter after each line of command)<br />
Following these steps will re-build the BCD.</p>

            C: is not a drive. The F: drive is a Windows Partition (strangely) but it is&nbsp;increasable&nbsp;in the CMD and Ubuntu. It only shows it in Windows Setup and Ubuntu Installer.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have extra partitions\drives, the drive lettering sometimes gets scrambled as compared to what it is after booting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You seem to have figured it out, but from the CMD Prompt, type in Dir *:\, where the the * represents a letter from C:\ to how ever many drives\partitions you have. BTW...There is a space after Dir...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confirm which drive letter is currently assigned to your windows partition, and substitute it for the C:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that the reason that "F:\" is inaccessible is that your boot loader (Ubuntu?) has marked it as "Hidden", and possibly "Inactive".&nbsp; This is common in some bootloaders to keep the unused OS from interfering and\or becoming corrupted...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, you may need a 3rd party partitioning\disk management program on a bootable CD to "Unhide" it and make "Active".... Being "Active" may not be necessary. I haven't played with this&nbsp;lately to remember specifically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you get to the command prompt, type in F: and hit enter...</p>
<p>Then try accessing the repair commands I mentioned, or GoBonkers... except use F: instead of C:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubuntu and Win 8 are a bit different I think... I know nothing about Linux...</p>
<p>It could be hidden for Win 8, and Linux doesn't&nbsp; "Recognize" the windows setting...</p>

<h2>            Skype Improvement&#58; Contact Groups With Message Board</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I like Skype, and I have few ideas how it would be better.</p>
<p>One of these ideas is contact groups with message board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be good if I could group my contacts and could share customized messages with them.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- I would like to create a group for my children's parents and share information with them.</p>
<p>- I would like to create groups for my suppliers, and share information what I'm looking for actually</p>
<p>- I would like to create a group for my family members and share information with them</p>
<p>- etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Csaba Marosi</p>

<p>
</p><p>Currently, creating a list for your contacts so you can easily manage them is not available in Skype for Windows 10, but you can find this feature on Skype for Windows desktop. Refer to
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA421/how-do-i-manage-my-contacts-in-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=manage+contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> for additional information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One workaround I could suggest, is you can create a group conversation and add the contacts you wish to show on the list. You can then rename the conversation to e.g. Family, Friends or whichever will fit the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us this feedback. We will make sure to collate these and pass it along to the appropriate support team for further improvements on the user experience of the app.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Does Not Recognize HDMI Port - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisew1234567890  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Does Not Recognize HDMI Port</h2>
                    <p>Every now and then my computer will not be able to detect my hdmi port.&nbsp; I have my tv set up as my 2nd monitor through the hdmi port.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 struggles to detect my hdmi port.&nbsp; It is physically installed correctly and the software is installed correctly.&nbsp;
 Windows 8.1 just doesn't detect it the hdmi port. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The cable is not the issue because I can plug it into my old computer running Vista and it detects it just fine.&nbsp; When I transfer it back to the computer running Windows 8.1 it can't detect it at all.&nbsp; All I get is a flicker on the screen indicating that
 it detected it briefly.&nbsp; Once in a while I'll be able to start up my computer and it'll detect it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried extending my monitor and telling it to connect VGA.&nbsp; That didn't work.</p>
<p>I've tried detecting software.&nbsp; It can't detect it at all.</p>
<p>I've tried updating Windows to the current update.&nbsp; That didn't work.</p>
<p>I've tried rolling my computer back to a prior time when it did detect it.&nbsp; That didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've only used Windows 8.1 for six months and I'm not liking it at all.&nbsp; It's full of glitches that should be obviously easy to fix.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to go to the path where you downloaded the file and stored. Now you can connect a pen drive&nbsp;and&nbsp; you just have to copy the downloaded file and paste it in the pen drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, connect the pen drive to the laptop and copy/paste or drag and drop the file into the laptop and complete the installation.</p>

<p>Hi Sangeeta, I read your response and it is totally unacceptable. Please escalate this support request to someone that can offer a value add solution, not the nonsense you are suggesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the original poster, I had to do a clean re-install BECAUSE OF MICROSOFT PROBLEMS INSTALLING W10 1511. So because of bugs in your upgrade process and bugs in your 'reset PC' process I no longer have a DVD player. It is totally impractical for me to
 now wipe the PC, reinstall W8, then upgrade it to Media Centre (even if this was possible) THEN wipe that and upgrade to W10 Pro again. How many hours do you think that will consume for the sake of installing a single DVD app?<br />
</p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8.&nbsp;</span><strong>Q: Will I keep the free app if I reinstall Windows using update and recovery?</strong></p>
<p>A: The free Windows DVD Player app is tied to your Windows 7 or Windows 8 Pro installation, so any action that reinstalls Windows over the top of an existing Windows 10 installation will break this tie and remove the free Windows DVD Player app.
 To recover the free app, you’ll have to use your installation media to re-install Windows 7 or Windows 8 Pro + Media Center, and then upgrade to Windows 10."</p>

 install. I hope you are not going to suggest that I revert to W8, then 8.1, then 8.1 MC then back to 10. This is the stupidist advice I have ever heard due to the many man hours it would take. What is MS going to do for people like me who have a right to this
 app due to previous purchases of Media Centre and then through no fault of our own, and more specifically due to the fault of Microsoft that I am forced to purchase something I should not have to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure your advice is professional, value adding and time effective or I will report you as an unhelpful, ineffective support staff.</p>

    <title>Keyboard language keeps changing automatically to a language I never - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard language keeps changing automatically to a language I never selected</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 on my Asus t100.</p>
<p>I bought the computer in the USA, and have English (USA) as my default language and USA as my location. I live in Israel, and have Hebrew as an addition language.</p>
<p>At random times, with no reason I can figure out, the computer changes my keyboard languages from alternating between Hebrew and English (USA) to alternating between Hebrew and English (CMS- Canadian Multilingual Standard). This version of English supports
 other languages, such as French, so many of the keys have uses that I don't want, for example all the keys which usually write punctuation marks, instead insert special characters, like É or è or à etc. Toggling the keyboard language only allows to go back
 and forth between Hebrew and English (CMS). In order to go back to English (USA) I have to manually select it via settings.</p>
<p>I never selected Canada as a location, and it doesn't appear in my language settings at all. I've tried adding it manually, deleting it and reaffirming English (USA) as my default language, but that doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me stop this annoying bug and have only the languages I want and use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi dggellman_arch, 
<br />
<br />please go to Control Panel &gt; Clock, Language, and Region &gt; Language 
<br />
<br />Each language you have added should have an assigned keyboard layout: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IHeU6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/IHeU6</a> 
<br />
<br />Such issues can occur if it says "Keyboard: None available" or "Not assigned" or more than one layout is assigned to a language. In such a case, pressing Ctrl + Shift will switch between different keyboard layouts on the same input language, which can cause confusion.
<br />
<br />Additionally, please make sure the system locale is correctly set: Control Panel &gt; Clock, Region and Language &gt; Region &gt; Administrative tab &gt; Current language for non-unicode programs &gt; Change system locale
<br />
<br />Please check these settings and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Ralitsa

<p>Thank you for your swift reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it only partially worked.</p>
<p>For a day or so, the keyboard settings were as I want them to be- alternating between two layouts- Hebrew and English (USA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after about 2 days, the English (CMS) reactivated itself, and now sometimes I only have English (CMS) and Hebrew, and sometimes I have three layouts alternating- English (CMS), English (USA), and Hebrew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the control panel language settings only the two layouts I want are selected (see image).</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/ZNQIG</p>
<p>
</p><p>In system locale I selected English (United States).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any further help you can provide.</p>

<p>MS have really made a mess of this. I have three PCs all logged into my MS account, and two of them lose their keyboard layout settings every single time they reboot (which is often, they're Windows boxes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS have hidden this issue in the Accounts settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Start Menu</p>
<p>2. Click Settings "cog wheel"</p>
<p>3. Choose "Accounts"</p>
<p>4. Click on "Sync your settings" on the sidebar</p>
<p>5. Turn off sync with the switch at the top of the page, or just "Language Preferences".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bear in mind that if you have more than one PC you will have to do this on all of them - it stops your PC from sending sync info to other PCs but doesn't stop them from sending to the one you're affected by.</p>

<p>I live &amp; work in the USA, and it's my work computer doing it. Outlook just updated itself yesterday morning (lots of minor visual changes). In the afternoon, it did it again. Our IT guy laughed when I asked him to explain why it suddenly decides - in the
 middle of an email - that my language is Spanish &amp; I've spelled everything incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the language is an interesting idea, I'll give that a shot today. I have a feeling it will come back, though. Such a strange error.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I do not use my surface pro 4 pen that much, but when I use it, most of the time it does not work. My current problem is that it writes in dots and parts of lines. Like the below. Anyone else seen this? The text reads 'this is what it is' btw. I already
 exchanged 3 SP3's and 1 SP4. Do I need to bring this back also?</p>

            Hi Prezioso
<br />
<br />This is a known issue.bug in Windows 10, where the clock speed of your RAM is incorrectly reported. This is nothing to worry about and will not in fact affect the performance of your PC.
<br />
<br />Windows reads that form the chip on the RAM module(s), however at a lower level the correct clock speed of you RAM is being used by your hardware, regardless of what Windows reports that to be . . .

            Thought i'd chime in and say thank you for once, Microsoft. I have Adata XPG Z1 3000mhz ram sticks set to 2933mhz showing as 1467mhz AS THEY SHOULD. It did confuse me at first, but i thank you all in the long run because the old report of 2933 mhz was
 in fact, wrong. Please keep it this way. It might be a good idea to let people know in an updated "whats new" page though, advertising it. The reason i prefer it this way is there arent conflicting reports between task manager and, for example, hwinfo64 or
 ryzen master.

<h2>            Photoshop CS5 DVD unreadable on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Win 10 -CS5 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently installed win10 and am still doing battle with it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest message stated that certain elements of my Photoshop CS5 program were missing and that I should re-install.&nbsp; However the disc drive will not open the DVD, though it works on other discs.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; After all the other issues
 with Win10 I am undecided whether this is yet another failure or whether it might be the Photoshop disc itself - incline towards the former as this disc has only been used once for installation and is in pristine condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful for any advice!</p>

            <p>Before reading your&nbsp;message I&nbsp;discovered a notice about compatibility of programs on the 'Action Centre' (a feature I hadn't&nbsp;found before) and followed the instructions there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubleshooter provided&nbsp;seems to have cleared&nbsp;issues on Photoshop which
 I'd noticed -&nbsp;and which&nbsp;prompted the message about re-installing to appear- so hopefully this has cleared the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I will follow your advice on making sure that the drivers are up to date as well, just in case.</p>

<h2>            I have a cracked touch screen Windows 8 on an ACER Aspire V5. Will a non touch screen replacement work&#63;</h2>
                    At the end of last year I went to buy a new laptop with Windows 7 on it, but there were none to be had unless you wanted to pay through the nose.&nbsp; I had to settle for an Acer Aspire with Windows 8 and touch screen.&nbsp; Now the screen is cracked in the lower
 left corner, but the video still works; except for the touch part.&nbsp; It is machine gunning hits all over the screen, opening, closing, enlarging, modifying, well just mayhem, and I'm not touching the thing.&nbsp; I took it back were I bought it to have it repaired
 and they said I would be better off cost wise with a new computer, as the touch screen part is very expensive.&nbsp; The computer is 6 months old and unusable.&nbsp; I still owe on it.&nbsp; Microsoft played a dirty trick on us by forcing Windows 8 when we didn't want it,
 and Acer did the same forcing ultra-thin touch screens priced out of sight.&nbsp; It really is tough as I use it in my work.<br />
<br />
I want to know if I had a <u>non</u> touch screen put on it, and they are available at reasonable cost, would Windows 8 be useable or would it not work at all?&nbsp; I could get along without touch screen if it at least was usable.&nbsp; I did try turning the touch off,
 but there was no option in Control Panel for it.<br />

            I followed the directions to Pen &amp; Touch once the screen settled down enough to be accessed.&nbsp; On the Touch tab there are three options: "<u>Touch action - Equivalent mouse action</u>",
<u>"Double-tap Double-click"</u> and "<u>Press and hold -&nbsp; Right-click"</u>.&nbsp; I could not access "Touch action" with the settings button, however I could change the other two in "settings".&nbsp; At the bottom is
<u>"Touch Feedback"</u> with two boxes to check or uncheck.&nbsp; <u>1)Show visual feedback when touching screen,</u>" (not checked). 2)
<u>Optimize visual feedback for projection to an external monitor"</u> which is not available.&nbsp; I see
<u>no box</u> that gives option <b>"Use your finger as an input device."</b>&nbsp; It must be an Acer thing.<br />
<br />
Yet another surprise.&nbsp; After a period of time while the screen goes crazy with random hits all over the screen, it stops suddenly and acts like a normal touch screen.&nbsp; It is good until it is powered down and brought back up, then the craziness starts again.&nbsp;
 I can't imagine it will be very stable if it gets bounced around much.<br />

            The exact same thing has happened to me! I have an aspire v5, and today I opened up my laptop and there was a crack in the lower left hand of the screen, but I have no idea how it got there, and just like you, my laptop goes crazy and then it stops for
 a bit and starts all over again!

<p>Surely it is still under manufacturer's warranty?&nbsp; Even if your retailer is not being helpful Acer might be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to know if I had a <u>non</u> touch screen put on it, and they are available at reasonable cost, would Windows 8 be useable or would it not work at all?&nbsp; I could get along without touch screen if it at least was usable.&nbsp; I did try turning the touch
 off, but there was no option in Control Panel for it.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the screen is viewable you can just disable the Touch screen drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most likely problem is the multi-touch.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I had to disable my multi-touch driver in the winter for the same reason.&nbsp; The pen still worked then so there was not much loss.&nbsp;
 Also, I would experiment with Touch and Pen Calibration because surely that would be an opportunity for the driver to take note of spurious interrupts and hopefully learn to ignore them?&nbsp;&nbsp; OTOH some other experimenters claim that deleting the Calibration dataset
 and not trying to save another one gives them better results; so YMMV.<br />

<p><br />
If you use the Device Manager method you don't need to know the driver.&nbsp; The Properties dialog will show you a Disable button.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you found a device which does multi-touch?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In case it helps you get a clue for us try this WMI query (e.g. in an Administrator Command Prompt):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\&gt;wmic.exe Path Win32_PnPEntity where (Description like "%touch%") get Description</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact, if you find a likely one that way you could change your pattern to match just it and then list all its properties with (for example)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\&gt;wmic.exe Path Win32_PnPEntity where (Description like "%multitouch%") get&nbsp; /format:list</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>E.g. in my case&nbsp; MultiTouch is a sufficient pattern to uniquely match one device.</p>

<h2>            IDE DVD Drive not showing in BIOS, but showing in My Computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently installed a new motherboard (Asus P5LD2 REV 2.01). <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ALMOST</span> everything is working great - Windows 7 is installed, and giving great performance. However, the IDE DVD Drive is not working great. It is connected to the Primary EIDE channel on the motherboard, and will NOT show in the BIOS main screen. It
 will, however, show in the BIOS boot device priority, the IDE scan, and the F8 Boot Menu. It also shows in COMPUTER, and Disk Management. The IDE DVD Drive loads and reads discs just fine! The main issue with it not showing in the BIOS is this: After the computer
 the computer has been turned off for a certain period of time, when I try to turn it on it reboots a few times before the "Starting Windows" phase comes on. The only way to fix this is by entering and exiting the BIOS, or entering the F8 boot menu, and selecting
 HARD DRIVE - which doesn't always stop it from rebooting. Also, when the computer has been turned off for a long period of time, sometimes I get no display or POST beep until I turn it off and on a few times, or press the reset button. The Hard Drive shows
 in the BIOS, and is connected to the PRI_IDE port (blue). I have tried two CD-ROM Drives, as a replacement to the IDE DVD Drive, and they just result in the computer not giving any display, or POST beep. The Hard Drive light keeps on flashing in the same pattern
 when an IDE CD Drive is connected. Without an optical drive connected, nothing works. Is there any fix to the problem with the IDE DVD Drive not showing in the BIOS Main Screen, and to the random rebooting issue? The Event Viewer shows a Kernel Power Error
 for every time this occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>

            Hi podvininc,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
Just to let you know, I have split this post off of <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistamedia/thread/c91aca81-b453-4f2b-98cc-bb2ee4feb077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistamedia/thread/c91aca81-b453-4f2b-98cc-bb2ee4feb077/</a><br />
<br />
since it was a new issue and not the original customer's issue.<br />
<br />
Here is a suggestion that was given in the link above.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Start Menu</strong> </li><li>Right-Click on <strong>Computer</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong> and a new window will open
</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong> on the left under <strong>Tasks</strong>
</li><li>Click on <strong>Continue</strong> in the UAC prompt </li><li>Click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and select <strong>Settings...</strong> under the
<strong>Performance</strong> area </li><li>Under <strong>Visual Effects</strong> you will see four options to choose from
</li><li><strong>Let Windows choose what's best for my computer</strong> usually works best for most users
</li><li>Verify that <strong>Show thumbnails instead of icons</strong> is <strong>checked</strong> or you can select
<strong>Adjust for best appearance</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong> </li><li>This may take some time to change </li></ol>
<br />
Since, I know that you have reviewed this information, I am curious because if you have Windows Choosing what is the best for the computer, it could be that the performance of the system would be altered if thumbnails show with the high performance specifications.<br />
<br />
One option that you could try is <br />
<br />
Boot into a clean boot state - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a><br />
<br />
Perform Step 1 of the procedure then check if your thumbnails work properly.<br />
If so move on to Step 2 and try again.<br />
Follow the steps outlined until the offending service/program is identified.&nbsp; Post that information into the forum and let's see if it is due to background programs/services that Windows selects to reduce the output for the thumbnails for.<br />
<br />
Please continue to post your information into this forum thread.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<p>I have no idea, but if the title does not come up in a search on the MS Store site (assuming this is what your are referring to</p>
<p>when you say 'they' ), then no, you cannot download the game package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's only the start of your worries. The games were made for Windows '95, and the compilation was released in '01, so</p>
<p>unless there is a recent re-release and update of the compilation the odds of the games in that bundle running on Win10 are slim.</p>
<p>The disc version would be more likely to fail than an updated download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately you can get some of the Star Trek games individually from on line retailers such as
<em>Good Old Games</em>. GOG do</p>
<p>all the fixes and tweaks necessary to make their games compatible with Win10.</p>
<p>They have a sale at the moment as well.&nbsp; How lucky is that ! (Not all that lucky. They have sales almost continuously, but they</p>
<p>don't always include the Star Trek games. ).</p>
<p>I'll pop in a link to one of them to get you started... </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/star_trek_25th_anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.gog.com/game/star_trek_25th_anniversary</a></p>
<p><br />
Looking again, I see they only have a few Star Trek games. It wasn't long ago they had large number of them.

<h2>            windows 10 HID problem</h2>
                    Hello, i have a chuwi vi8 dual boot tablet. I have installed windows 10 using usb, after the update i had a touch problem as many others with an inresponsive touch. So, i downloaded the windows 8.1 drivers to install them. I uninstalled the all &nbsp;HID devices
 from Device Manager and now they are missing! I 've made the search for new devices and also enabled to display the hidden devices. So, now i cannot instal any drivers. Finally, i ve made a full restore with no result.

    <title>Micro SD Card not locking in place - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinsullivan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Micro SD Card not locking in place</h2>
                    <p>I have had a micro SD card in my Surface Pro since I purchased it just over a year ago. Last week I removed the card - it came out perfectly normally. I then used the card in an normal sized SD card adapter, in another laptop.</p>
<p>When I try to replace the micro card it does not lock in place, in fact it ‘shoots’ the card out. I have tried all the ‘tricks’ mentioned in other posts, without any sucess.</p>
<p>Does this mean I have to send the Surface to Microsoft for repair? Or has anyone else come across this issue?</p>

<p>Tricks - mostly trying to push the card in as far as possible - which is when it shot out across the room! Also tried various other micro cards with the same result. It’s really odd as I have removed the card before and it’s always gone back without any
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model is a Surface Pro_4, which I love!</p>

            If it doesn't click and lock into place AND you have tried multiple microSD cards, this could be hardware.&nbsp;

<p>************** JIT Debugging **************</p>
<p>To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this</p>
<p>application or computer (machine.config) must have the</p>
<p>jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.</p>
<p>The application must also be compiled with debugging</p>
<p>enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception</p>
<p>will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer</p>
<p>rather than be handled by this dialog box.</p>

            Hi Laura, a couple of theories on how to fix this:
<br />
<br />
<br />Do you run the Chrome Browser?
<br />
<br />If so, googleupdater.exe is known to cause this"
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if Google Update Service is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list you will find at least 2 items with Google Updater, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Restart your System and this annoyance will be gone . . .
<br />
<br />If you do nor run the Chrome Browser:
<br />
<br />Open Internet Explorer (click your Start Button type ie and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Click the cog wheel at the top right of Internet Explorer, then select Internet Options
<br />
<br />On the advanced Tab, in the browsing section,  Disable Script Debugging in IE and other . . .       
        </p>

<p>First of all thanks for your help</p>
<p>I did not found in the task manager any google update service</p>
<p>I did found it in the system configuration and unchecked the two lines, after that restarted the computer but the same message appeared again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know any other solution?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
