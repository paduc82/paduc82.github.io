    <title>Print a pdf file using Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Print a pdf file using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I cannot print pdf files since purchasing a new Windows 10 installed laptop. &nbsp;I have downloaded the current drivers for my HP Photosmart printer and correctly installed it. &nbsp;Every other type of file prints perfectly, also highlighted selections from web
 pages, whatever I've tried to print. &nbsp;However, when I try to print a pdf the task goes to the print queue where it stalls, so that nothing else can print either. &nbsp;The only way to delete the task is to delete it from the printer queue (when it hangs and doesn't
 actually delete, restart or obey any other command) and then restart my computer. &nbsp;I am totally fed up with following links and trying fixes. The only way I can print a pdf is to take a screenshot and paste it into Publisher, crop and resize. &nbsp;Then I can get
 a print. &nbsp;I have not found a way to print the pdf as an image, which I think might also work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to print from Edge, IE, Adobe Reader app, Xodo app, reader app - please help me!</p>

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have followed the instructions, but now get a box which says "View and Track your Downloads" and gives me the choice to Open or Save.&nbsp; Neither of these boxes actually appears to do anything.&nbsp; There is a quick flash on the screen
 as if IE is trying to open the file but nothing happens.&nbsp; Save just adds another copy of the pdf file to the list.

            <p>Hi ettenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for reporting this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you are not able to view the PDF in IE is that unlike Edge which is able to show PDFs without any additional plugins, IE needs a plugin from other vendors like Adobe Reader, Foxit, etc., to be able to show PDFs.</p>
<p>Without these plugins in IE, you will only be able to save the PDF and won't be able to view it.
</p>
<p>Clicking 'Open' in the 'Open' or 'Save' dialog thrown by IE when you don't have these plugins would launch your default PDF viewer, which&nbsp;would be Edge. This is probably why you see a Flash in the screen, since your default PDF viewer opens up now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said,&nbsp;regarding your original question, can you please share some details:</p>
<p>- When you initially tried printing the PDF from Edge, did you run into this issue with just one PDF file? Or weren't you able to print any PDF files?</p>
<p>- *Before* you changed your default browser to IE, were you able to print to other virtual printers like 'Microsoft Print to PDF' or 'Microsoft XPS Document Writer'?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p>Ok thank you for the explanation, I understand that re IE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same situation has occurred with all the PDFs I've tried to print from Edge. &nbsp;I get the printer dialogue box which means I can select Properties, number of copies etc. &nbsp;Click Print, and it hangs - I now discover the same happens with the Photos App (I
 assume when I view a picture and right click and get the dialogue box I'm in Photos? &nbsp;The App sends the document to the printer queue but it does not print. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM able to print from Office programs, plus from Acrobat Reader, plus from Chrome browser (even part web pages using Ctrl+Shift+P).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my next task is to find an external photo viewer to download which will print my pictures when I want to do that!</p>
<p>Thanks again. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Regarding "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>I assume when I view a picture and right click and get the dialogue box I'm in Photos ?</strong></span>" -&nbsp;can you try the following steps to make sure you are in the 'Photos' Windows
 Store App?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Start Menu</li><li>Type in 'Photos'</li><li>Select the Photos Windows Store App from the search results. (This would show up as a Trusted Windows Store App in your search results)</li><li>Select a photo from your collection</li><li>Press Ctrl+P</li><li>Choose the same printer (HP Photosmart)</li><li>Press Print</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge printing is more similar to that of Windows Store Apps like 'Photos'/'Maps' than the Win32 apps you tried, hence confirming whether printing with the same printer works in another Windows Store App like Photos would be particularly useful
 for us.<br />

            Thank you, glad to hear I may get a solution. &nbsp;It's been very frustrating as I was so excited to try out Windows 10 and my new laptop. &nbsp;I can't help wondering if it's a 64 bit problem? &nbsp;I really don't want to get a new printer as the current one (HP Photosmart
 5520 is fairly new and I have spare cartridges, also I don't know if a new one will work any better. &nbsp;I don't seem to be able to print from any Apps, only full old-fashi.oned programs

            <p>No I have not found a solution. &nbsp;I can only print from Windows 7 designed programs. &nbsp;I CAN print from Office 2007 including Publisher, Google Chrome browser, Acrobat Reader DC. &nbsp;I CANNOT print from Edge or IE, or ANY of the Win 10 Apps (eg photos) installed
 on the laptop or downloaded from The Store. &nbsp;Trying to print from these brings up the printer dialogue box, accepts the instruction Print but then hangs and blocks the printer queue. &nbsp;Task cannot be deleted and is only cleared by attempting to delete and then
 restarting the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP have tried to be very helpful (Photosmart 5520 printer) and spent some considerable time on my machine uninstalling and reinstalling the software and drivers but still the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft technician said "it must be Toshiba or HP we can probably fix it but there is a cost of $69" - I think that was the amount. &nbsp;I declined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba (laptop is a Satellite with Win 10 preinstalled) said it must be a driver problem as you can print from "older style Win 7 programs" but not from Win 10 ones.</p>

<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Start Windows Windows 7&nbsp;with the Windows installation media, and then<br />
use the Repair feature <br />

<strong>Method 2</strong>: Start the system in safe mode, and then use the System Restore feature<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You can also do a System Restore by booting up with a&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>: Use the Downloads at the end of this article.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows&nbsp;Windows 7<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong>:<br />
<br />
At the Command Prompt or Recovery Options or a Windows 7 disk boot<br />
<br />
Type or copy and paste these in one at a time (not the press ENTER)<br />
<br />
c:windows\winsxs\ in the commandprompt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
press ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR pending.*<br />
press ENTER&nbsp; and you should see the pending.xml<br />
<br />
ren pending.xml pending.old<br />
press ENTER.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is the older complete Method 4<br />
<br />
Use the System Recovery options or Windows 7 Boot Disk to rename the Pending.xml file and<br />
edit the registry:</p>
<p>On the System Recovery Options page, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Type cd C:\windows\winsxs, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type ren pending.xml pending.old, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type regedit, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.</p>
<p>On the File menu, click Load Hive.</p>
<p>Locate the following folder:</p>
<p>C:\windows\system32\config\components</p>
<p>When you are prompted for a name, type Offline_Components.</p>
<p>In Registry Editor, locate and then delete the following registry<br />
subkey:</p>
<p>HLKM\Offline Components\AdvancedInstallersNeedResolving</p>
<p>HKLM\Offline Components\PendingXmlIdentifier</p>
<p>Exit Registry Editor:</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type exit to exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Press ENTER.</p>
<p>Restart System<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once you are in Windows again I would run the Reset here as a precaution.<br />

<p>If you can't get into Windows you need a Windows 7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have one<br />
you can borrow a friends as the are not copy protected and the system maker will usually<br />
sell you the physical disk cheap (you are only paying for the DVD as you already own<br />
Windows 7). Or you can make a Repair Disk.<br />

    <title>Resize and rearrange desktop icons with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Resize and rearrange desktop icons with ctrl&#43;shift&#43;&#40;1-0&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, first of all sorry for my google-translated English.<br />
Today I've figured out that with ctrl+shift+(1-0) combinations I can change size and display type of desktop icons. But I found a problem with ctrl+shift+5 mode. I've made 2 screenshots, to show the problem. The first one in ctrl+shift+6 mode, shows files I
 have on desktop.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1da08e-3176-4934-9884-c1f34d24e465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1da08e-3176-4934-9884-c1f34d24e465" /></a></p>
<p>And the second one: files are arranged horizontally, and only twelve of them are visible.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/def38aba-ff4c-48e5-8f83-598e35f05ab9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/def38aba-ff4c-48e5-8f83-598e35f05ab9" /></a></p>
<p>But first time I used this mode, icons were vertically arranged. Is there a way to fix it?<br />
Thank you in advice.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Can I use both the Microsoft Arc Keyboard and the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse on a single transceiver&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought both the Microsoft Arc Keyboard and the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse. I am switching from Logitech where one transceiver can act for multiple devices. Is it possible to do the same and instead of having to use two transceivers I can have one
 for both the keyboard and mouse?

<h2>            How to reinstall a Broken Shortcut&#63;</h2>
                    About a month ago I installed this useful file that id open to just help me with certain quests. And I turned on my auto clicker which I just use to check if my laptop's smooth enough to run a game. Then it just went ballistic and my mouse started moving
 everywhere and closing tabs. Nothing too serious til I was checking ProPresser file that I have as a shortcut. It's a really useful macro program and when I opened it this error message came up: "The item that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved,
 so this shortcut may not work properly. Do you wish to delete it?" The first time I obviously said no, but I has to after a while. I tried uninstalling it but couldn't find it in the list to uninstall or In the recycling bin. Should I change the name of the
 program after I install it to make it work again? What do I do someone please help me.

            Sorry if i am suggesting things you have tried because I am not sure which ones you have done.
<br />
<br />Right click start and select network connections.
<br />Click Change Adapter Options.
<br />Right click your wifi card and then reboot.
<br />Once you are logged back in go back to Change Adapter Options and re-enable your card.  
<br />
<br />Run the network troubleshooter.
<br />Go to search and type troubleshoot.
<br />Select Network Adapter and run through it.
<br />Then in the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
<br />At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<br />Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
<br />Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.
<br />
<br />None of that works try the link below for troubleshooting steps.
<br />You might have installed an update recently causing issues.

</p><p>I am only able to startup windows by disabling driver signing (F7), I believe this may also have something to do with my inability to update to the April 1803 update for windows.</p>
<p>After much trial and error and messing around I think I have discovered the culprits, but have no idea how to fix them. I tried a clean install of windows and even that crashes...</p>
<p>the errors I am receiving from event viewer are as follows</p>

</p><p>Code Integrity error 3037</p>

            Since you cannot update to 1803 and show "unsigned" Windows components consider a "repair" install of Windows 10 - as a general precaution back up any critical files beforehand:

<h2>            Red Light less then day old console</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased a Xbox 250 GB console from walmart (the one that comes with black ops) yesterday at 3 in the afternoon, a few minutes ago my significant other turned it on and it had the red light and some error across it, we turned it off and back on and
 it booted but it wouldnt detect the hard drive. We again rebooted it and it did detect the hard drive, so I backed up everything onto a usb stick.</p>
<p>Question is, if its already red lighting at less then a day old do I take it back?</p>
<p>If it matters its setting up vertical and connected through hdmi&nbsp;</p>

<p>I returned it for a new one which leads me to my new question, I had already transfered my licenses to the new console, so I cant again. Does that mean i'm screwed till the 121 days is up?</p>

            <p>Hi Susan Martinho,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try to install drivers for the printer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The Lexmark X1270 All-In-One Printer is very much compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link below for information on compatibility of the printer with Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=Lexmark%20X1270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=Lexmark%20X1270</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and install the printer drivers from the link for Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X1270&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X1270&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to install drivers from optional update; you may refer the article for more information:</p>

    <title>dontrefresh not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dieterjanssen  say:</h3>
<h2>            dontrefresh not found</h2>
                    <p>Working with Windows 10, file and folder name edits must be manually refreshed in order to show their change. It appears from web searches, the typical solution is to go into the
<em>Registry Editor</em> and find the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/dontrefresh</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the value is 1, change it to 0. (first back up your data)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that <em>dontrefresh</em> doesn't exist or can't be found. That in itself may be the problem - no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any clues how to fix this?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is a very tough one to solve. What are the KB articles if any shown as not installing?<br />
<br />
How do I reset Windows Update components?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for
<br />
Windows Server 2008 R2 Release Candidate, and for Windows 7 Release Candidat<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</span></a><br />
<br />
Those are sort of prerequisites and probably will not solve the issue.<br />
<br />
Antivirus/antispyware/security products are a known cause so you might want to disable them as
<br />
as test (and that sometimes does not really totally remove their influence).<br />
<br />
How do I restore security settings to the default settings?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313222</span></a><br />

<p>Its usually a premissions issue :<br />
<br />
Please check this link and the ones it sites.<br />
<br />

            Hi Sophie,
<br />
<br />While the 2 physically connect, I’m not sure (doubtful) that the macOS will allow the windows PC to detect it as a display. 
<br />
<br />I’m not even sure there is software to accomadate this task. The only thing I can think of is a Remote Desktop app that allows you to remote into it but that doesn’t really help...
<br />
<br />Have you seen this done before? Let me know!

            Hello. The same is happening to me for the second time with a Dell PC. The first time, 2 days ago, it took more than 10 hours to move out of the Update message. The PC does not reboot with a System Repair DVD; it goes to that screen ("Keep your PC plugged
 in until this is done. Installing update 6 of 9 ...") even if the Hard Disk is disabled in the BIOS. According to my experience last time, I guess it will come back to normal tomorrow morning. Questions: What is the real cause of this problem? How can this
 be fixed? Thanks, Jesus.

<p><br />
The problem is apparently far more widespread than just HP &amp; Dell.&nbsp; I have three Windows 8 Pro computers all doing exactly the same thing.&nbsp; Two&nbsp;are clones and one is a Dell.&nbsp; Of the clones, one uses an Intel DG965OT motherboard with a Q6600 quad core processor.&nbsp;
 The other uses an&nbsp;Atom N280 processor on a Zotac mini ITX board.&nbsp; All three reach "Installing Update&nbsp;X of X" and stay there for 12-18 hours.&nbsp; Then the computers reboot and appear normal until the next time I try to shutdown.&nbsp; At which point, the process repeats.&nbsp;
 This has been happening for three weeks now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that it is the same update that is causing the hang and that it never fully installs before Windows 8 simply reboots.&nbsp; This is because if I try to install any other update, for example nVidia display driver update, it says that it cannot complete
 because another update is in progress.&nbsp; Wait until that one completes and then try again.&nbsp; This happens when I try to install any other update including HP wireless printer utility, Acrobat, Java, etc.&nbsp; I can't begin to imagine using Windows 8 in a business
 office with the system hanging from the start of the business day til the end of the next business day.&nbsp; What gives???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three installations of Windows 8 Pro were downloaded from Microsoft.&nbsp; One on the day of release (October 26, 2012), one in&nbsp;early January and one in mid January.&nbsp; Note that I am a tech savy person with some 30 computers in the house including eleven servers.&nbsp;
 Fortunately, only these three are running Windows 8.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 windows update stuck checking for updates</h2>
                    <p>I have had Dell Windows 7 for 4 years or more and on 14th June 2016 was last updates installed&nbsp;followed by Windows stuck checking for updates. After Windows updates diagnostic run which did not mend problems&nbsp;I restore Windows 7 with disc I have on&nbsp;23rd June
 2016. </p>
<p>Day latter problem returned. I have seen some mentions of this problems which is not really logical because I restored&nbsp;Windows 7.</p>
<p>Is Microsoft causing problems for us to buy Windows 10. I have Dell studio laptop which I keep for watching movies and making music, I would like this problem solved of updates. I will also buy Windows 10 PC to surf net at some point.

            <p>They've issued updates no update client, particularly not 7.6.7600.320, could handle over months, and only a few days ago released an appropriate one. On your current installation, only KB3161608 would have been needed. On a fresh installation, it takes
 KB3020369 as a prerequiste, too.</p>

            <p>Yeah it's a known problem, it takes much longer to process update lists, check for superseded updates and such due to some change MS made in the update client and servicing stack about a year ago.&nbsp; Seemed to get really bad around November or December of
 2015.&nbsp; Since you're starting from a fresh install/restore, after installing that 'initial' requisite update to the Windows Update Client, it's best to just leave it to check automatically for updates (disable sleep or hibernate PM timers) and come back in
 a few hours.&nbsp; You can download large update rollups, service packs, that will get you close to current. e.g.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 (if not already applied/installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Convenience Rollup for Windows 7</a> (akin to a Service Pack 2 but is not deemed a Service Pack by Microsoft).&nbsp; See also
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page for more</a> explanation.&nbsp; Be sure to get the per-requisite update to the servicing stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When checking for updates for the first time <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
after</span> the big rollup, it will still take a while to process/check for updates, maybe up to an hour.&nbsp; And there will still be about 40 updates to download.&nbsp; But thereafter, it shouldn't take any longer than it used to (e.g. a few minutes).</p>

</p><p>I gotta get this idea out of people's minds. It will take long if you install <em>
nothing but the rollup</em>. But since he installs KB3161608, it will neither take long

<p>
</p><p>Well since KB3161608 is just released, I guess we'll have to wait and see - I haven't tried it yet.&nbsp; Given that MS has released at least TWO (not one) prior updates for the Windows Update client that were
<em>supposed</em> to address the unusually long update check but none have improved much thus far (I've tested them, as have many others), hence the reason for yet another one, I'll believe it when I see the reports that it works (or have tested it myself).&nbsp;
 Thanks for bringing my attention to the new update, though.<br />

    <title>Plugging in USB Controller &#40;Charge and Play&#41; Kills XBOX 360 S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wtfsrsly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plugging in USB Controller &#40;Charge and Play&#41; Kills XBOX 360 S Power</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all;</p>
<p>I bought a new XBOX 360 S in Nov 2012 at Game Stop, part of the Holiday Bundle Deal with Skyrim, Forza, and COD or Battlefield (forget which), to replace my aging near-first generation "screamin' PSU" XBOX.</p>
<p>All was great initially, but then a month or so ago it started having issues powering on. &nbsp;I quickly figured out that if I pulled the power out of the power brick (not the XBOX, but the cable that goes from wall to power brick), let the fans stop, and then
 plugged it back in, it would work again for several days. &nbsp;Then same issue would then reoccur, and rinse/repeat.</p>
<p>As of the other day, the charge and play controller was no longer charged nor would the XBOX power on. &nbsp;Grrrr. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally got a chance to troubleshoot tonight and narrowed down the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unplugging all USB controllers from the front USB ports and resetting the power brick, the XBOX powers on without issue;
</li><li>Plugging in a USB connector/charging cable (I have several and tried them all) kills the power brick light, and obviously, the XBOX does not power on, ;
</li><li>Plugging in the controller with any cable to my PC (Windows 7), it's not recognized by Windows, nor does it power on or flash green lights at all;
</li><li>Using standard AA batteries in the controller(s), all works fine; </li></ul>
<div>So, all of that noted, it appears to be either the cable or battery pack, or maybe both. &nbsp;I bought new charger cables from a local GameStop a month or two ago as the controller was throwing random "reconnect controller" errors even when plugged in, and
 the red charging light on the cable/controller connector wouldn't stay on consistently. &nbsp;Which sorta narrows it down to the controller or battery pack I'd think, right?</div>

<div>Any ideas, things to try, or just try to get a new one via warranty? &nbsp;Are controllers even warrantied the same as the console or I have to buy a new one?</div>

<div>Thanks in advance for any help!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later model controllers (like, Halo 4 console controllers) have a hardware ID that the existing drivers do not recognize. They should show up, but with a yellow exclamation mark in Device Manager. They won't charge. Note that even when "working", all you're
 going to get is charging from the PC. The P&amp;C cable doesn't carry data.[quote]Any ideas, things to try, or just try to get a new one via warranty?[/quote]I would verify first that your console works fine with USB flash drives or USB HDDs attached to the front
 USB ports. If so, I would forgo using P&amp;C altogether and switch to a few sets of AA rechargeable batteries and a AA recharger.[quote]Are controllers even warrantied the same as the console or I have to buy a new one?[/quote]Accessories have a 90 day warranty.</p>

<p>Ok, got busy with other stuff, but finally got a chance to plug in a USB drive last night, and the XBOX saw it fine. &nbsp;Additionally, if using AA batteries with the controllers, no issues.</p>
<p>So, it seems to be a P&amp;C issue I guess. &nbsp;Since it's past 90 days, I'm SOL unless I just buy new controllers?</p>

            If you used the Reset function and selected to Keep your files, those files are the ones in Documents, Pictures etc. The mail database isn't kept there so the files you downloaded into Incredimail may well be&nbsp;lost. Depending on your mail provider you may
 still be able to find them by logging into their webpage using your user name and password.
