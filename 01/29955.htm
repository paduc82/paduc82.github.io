    <title>Windows 10 no longer activated after a reinstall, is there anything I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt van antwerpen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 no longer activated after a reinstall, is there anything I can do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I originally installed Windows 10 on my pc, I installed a copy of Windows 10 education 64bit, but relatively recently i had issues with viruses and decided to reinstall windows, at which point I installed Windows 10 Home as i had a disk laying around.
 I only realized I had the wrong version later, and my windows is now un-activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its been a few months like this and want to reactivate my pc, so I am wondering if going back to Education edition would cause it to be reactivated or if i need to purchase windows again? If not, is there any other way to solve this? I've used cmd and powershell
 to check for any existing product keys on my device but none have showed up as of yet.<br />
</p>
<p>any help is very much appreciated</p>

            Hi Matt ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />If you already have Acquired a license for Windows Education, you will not need to make another purchase, just reinstall your operating system with the Windows version corresponding to your product key which can obtain the key in the following way:
<br />
<br />Find out your Windows activation key without programs
<br />To know the activation key of Windows without any program you must follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the start menu and type " regedit ", right click on the search result and select the option " run as administrator ".
<br />windows regedit
<br />
<br />After opening the registry editor, open the path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt; SOFTWARE&gt; Microsoft&gt; Windows NT&gt; CurrentVersion&gt; SoftwareProtectionPlatform
<br />
<br />After clicking on SoftwareProtectionPlatform look for the entry BackupProductKeyDefault and the value that appears as a third party in the list is your Windows activation key.
<br />
<br />The key has a format of five groups of five characters each . It looks something like this: TG59Ñ-W3M1G-FGBSX-4YWX6-6F2CY.
<br />
<br />I wish I had helped you. Let me know any questions.
<br />Regards

            Hi Matt.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How was Education activated?  It normally is used by organizations who use Volume Licensing and activate using an on site server.  So we need to know how it was originally activated to advise you.  
<br />
<br />You'd also need to reinstall the very same version for it to reactivate with the Digital LIcense or retail key you have.  Those installers for Education or Enterprise need to come from the organization activating them.
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            im currently running Windows 10 Home, and it is not activated. Initially when i built this device, My step father was around and used an education edition key as he happened to have one around. i believe if I look around i can find the same installation
 disk, would this affect anything?

            If it activated Education version with a Digital License then it should reactivate when you reinstall it.  Did you happen to notice?  If you'd signed in with your Microsoft Account it may even be listed in the online Account as associate with the Device.

            we activated Education edition with a product key, which i no longer have written down, although through a suggestion from LuciaLabanino above, I did find a product key on my device using regedit. and yes, i am signed in with my microsoft account, however
 i dont see any indication of the sort.

            Matt, that might be the retail Product Key, but more likely the key was converted to a Digital LIcense which is how all Windows 10 licenses are being handled now.  These use only the Generic Version key so compare the key you found with that key in the list here:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>.  If the PC shipped with WIndows 8 or 10 it might also be the embedded Product Key.  These keys are broken down separately if you install and run ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>.  Try copy and pasting each of them in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  Give each a day to see if it activates.  
<br />

<p>the pc didnt ship with a copy of windows, as i built the pc myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>better way to explain it-</p>
<p>1. built the computer with individual parts, no windows included</p>
<p>2. found a copy of windows 10 education as my step father used them often</p>
<p>3. installed and worked fine (no longer have that key written down)</p>
<p>4. a few months later, reinstall using windows 10 home, no longer activated</p>
<p>5. today, find a key using regedit</p>
<p>
</p><p>thats all that has happened this far, it wasnt an embedded key, and the key i found in regedit did not match the keys in the website.</p>

            Then it may be the retail Education Key.  There are retail Edu keys and organization Volume LIcense keys.  A consumer needs to use retail, which I suspect is what you had.  
<br />
<br />Remember that it could have converted to a DL so if the detected key doesn't work, try the Generic version key which is all that can be present for a Digital LIcense.  They have started converting these more in the past few years, even retail or OEM keys.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>ACTIVE DESKTOP RECOVERY ..on desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ursi  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACTIVE DESKTOP RECOVERY ..on desktop</h2>
                    The program that I was working in locked my computer up and since Task Manager would not stop it, I manually shot it down, but when I re-booted, my desktop picture was gone and it says something: ACTIVE DESKTOP RECOVERY with all kind of troubleshooting
 tips.<br />
I don't seem to be able to fix the problem with the tips given, since&nbsp; the user under which I was working under on that computer has no administrator rights, can someone tell me how I can get my background back (instead of a white background with all of the
 Active Desktop Recovery tips). I would be sooo grateful - since I am not that knowledgeable when it comes to computer.<br />

            Hi  RAMIDABBAH 
<br />
<br />Usually this suggest you need to update your BIOS or chipset drivers. 
<br />
<br />I noticed the last BIOS update was from August 2016. You could try applying this update to see if it helps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://cdgenp01.csd.toshiba.com/content/support/downloads/sk2cv170.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cdgenp01.csd.toshiba.com/content/suppor...</a>
<br />
<br />Please also keep in mind, this system does not have any Windows 10 native drivers, so this might be a sign of compatibility issues with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Your best option might be to rollback to your previous version of Windows:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-use-the-rollback-function-in-windows-10/3e9e5c2d-239f-488c-9f48-64a226302657">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC.

    <title>How to change default WAV file as music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perkeybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change default WAV file as music</h2>
                    How do I stop the default wav file in file Explorer as "MUSIC"?<br />
&nbsp;I have thousands of acoustic files that ARE NOT music and can not&nbsp; get WIn7 to stop assigning them to "MUSIC."<br />
<br />
Yes I realize that in a single directory one can select that and for that one ONLY the choose custom and set it to general.&nbsp;
<br />
However this does not always work either.<br />
<br />
I need to make sure the Explorer panes DOES not display the MUSIC parameters but the standard general attributes<br />
What displays is <b>Name title contributing artist album.</b><br />
<br />
What I need is the standard data, file size name etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
A search on the WEB has provided nothing but the simplistic change one directory at a time.<br />
There must be a reg edit that can be completed?<br />
<br />
<br />

I am sorry that is NOT correct and I may not have been very clear.<br />
<br />
The WAV files <u><b>ARE NOT music</b></u> files and I do NOT need/want these to play them on any media playing software.<br />
<br />
These are research sound files of ultrasonic bat calls .&nbsp; I just need these to display correctly in Windows 7 64 bit file Explorer as stadnrd files w/o all the Music ralte and unnecessary information.<br />

<h2>            Recovering deleted messages.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>We unfortunately suspect our son is bullying his classmates over Xbox live messenger. We walked in on him sending a nasty message and he told us he didn't know why he was doing it, when we asked if he'd sent others he said he didn't know and had deleted
 all of his previous messages.</p>
<p>we want to be sure that he apologises to everyone he's sent messages to but we can't see any option to recover messages in the family settings or in his profile.</p>
<p>any help here would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Found it!</p>
<p>I logged in to xbox.com with my son's account and all of his sent messages were there even though they had been deleted from his xbox and weren't visible with the xbox glass app.</p>
<p>So, unfortunately we can't see what people had said to him, we can see the messages he sent out after he thought he'd deleted them... Now just to keep it secret from him! ;)</p>
<p>Thanks for the response Smwutches.</p>

<p>I have a new Win 10 desktop that has been in production for 2 months. &nbsp;I have gone into power settings and told it to never sleep or turn off. &nbsp;just let display off after 30 min. &nbsp;I have turned off all power saving options for the NIC card. &nbsp;The PC is set

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As you may already know this issue, we cannot determine yet if the issue is hardware or software related. We see&nbsp;you've done advanced troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue, at this point, we may consider performing a &nbsp;clean installation of windows 10.
 Any issues with the installed&nbsp;drivers may also be addressed by&nbsp;this step. However this is a drastic step, since this could cause you to&nbsp;&nbsp;lose all of your files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option that we have is to go directly to the manufacturer of your device. They should be able to verify if the drivers that you have on your computer are the ones needed for&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;not to lose connection to the network. Also, if it turns out that the
 issue is hardware-related,&nbsp; the device manufacturer should be able to address it as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'll have other concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

<p>Nope when purchasing any promotion or dashboard membership if you read below the purchase this button there is a box this membership will renew
</p>
<p>As it is a subscription this is normal alot of gaming services use the subscription Model and prepaid model also alot of services still require a phone call for verification
</p>
<p>If you do not want to call it simple don't enjoy the simplicity of subscription like free games or discounted service and buy prepaid cards</p>
<p>As with many services cellphone phone cable and electricity they are allowed to dictate how you can cancel 90% of services still require a phonecall

<h2>            &#34;Could not connect all network drives&#34; error when waking Windows 10 from sleep</h2>
                    <p>A very annoying issue that has been with us for three generations of Windows now (since Windows 7) is that if you have an File Explorer window open connected to a network location when you put the computer to sleep, it will wake with an error stating it
 could not connect to the network. The issue is that Windows tries to refresh the File Explorer window prior to the network being available.&nbsp; I often have several File Explorer windows open to different network locations as work which means having to click
 "OK" to dismiss the error dialogue several times every time my computer wakes from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to stop this error appearing? I see several other threads around the deal with the issue but no real permanent solutions.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 desktop icons move after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boris svigir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 desktop icons move after reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time in my life (and i'm 41)&nbsp;posting a question for windows product like this but i'm already desperate with this annoying icon problem and i consider myself as an advanced PC user.</p>
<p>I like to arrange my desktop icons (and i have many) in my own way all over the desktop for my convenience and until few days ago they always reappeard on the same place where i put them after restart or shutdown.</p>
<p>A few days ago i bought a new TV (LG LCD 80cm) with HDMI input and connect it with my Nvidia GeForce 9400GT graphic card over a 10m long hi-speed HDMI cable and turn on my PC. During boot up time i selected Windows 7 (by the way i have 3 OS-es on one HDD
 on 3 separate partitions: WinXPpro, Win7pro 64bit, and&nbsp;Ubuntu 11.04 64bit) and when the loggin screen should appeard there was only blank screen on my primary monitor ACER A221HQ (22'') connected over VGA cable. I couldn't even logg in to windows until it
 hits me, i better turn on the TV as well and BINGO, my loggin screen was on TV and not on my monitor. Then i try to set my monitor as primary display only to be prompted to have obsolete Nvidia graphic card driver and that i have to download the latest version.
 Not being lazy i done that, open up the Nvidia control panel and set both&nbsp;displays to clone mode but the TV remains to be marked as 1 (primary)&nbsp;and the monitor as 2 (secondary) and there &nbsp;is no option to manually set monitor as display one (primary).</p>
<p>After that everytime i boot windows 7 the desktop icons move to the left side of the screen no matter what i do in desktop options menu.</p>
<p>I guess this happens because the windows now think my TV is the primary display, not the monitor and therefore sends the desktop to TV only to realize that is turned off and then sends it&nbsp;to the monitor but with rearranged desktop icons for whatever stupid
 reason because&nbsp;i have&nbsp;set resolutions on both displays to their native resolution of&nbsp;1920x1080 / 32bit color / 60Hz.</p>
<p>Does anyone have some idea how to fix this? I have tryed to install this 3rd party software for saving desktop icon position, but it didn't work, have to uninstall it.</p>
<p>By the way this problem appears only on Windows 7, Windows XP have no such problem at all nor Ubuntu 11.04.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>
<p>(Sorry for any gramatical errors, but&nbsp;English is not my native language)</p>

            I'm pretty sure you're correct about the why behind this, and I don't have an immediate built-in solution. &nbsp;However I'd recommend one program from a company that has done a lot of work with and licensed a lot of software to Microsoft. &nbsp;It's a desktop icon
 arrangement program called Fences by StarDock. &nbsp;It might suit your needs.

<h2>            Xbox 360 Controller Issues on PC</h2>
                    <p>Having issues with a 360 controller running on Windows 7.&nbsp; For some reason, pulling the right trigger locks in that command.&nbsp;&nbsp;The device behaves as though you are holding down the trigger even after you release it.&nbsp; Pulling the left trigger overrides this temporarily, but as soon as you release it, it returns to the right trigger locked state.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have tested the controller on other computers (also running Windows 7), and it worked fine.&nbsp; I&nbsp;updated the drivers to the same versions that are on the other computers, but I am still having this issue.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>It's very tough thing to troubleshoot, as it might be the OS and drivers, or the controller.&nbsp; I'd say check the USB port you're using on the PC, try a different one.&nbsp; Is this a wired controller, or are you using the Xbox 360 wireless connector?</p>

            <p>EDIT:&nbsp;Fixed it.&nbsp; Fiddled with drivers and uninstalling/reinstalling programs for a while, but eventually figured out that I&nbsp;just had to run the joy.cpl program and recalibrate the controller (there's a calibrate button on the Settings&nbsp;tab).</p><p><br /></p><p>This is an Xbox 360 Wired Controller btw.</p>

            W10 automatically brought that up when I connected to the internet.&nbsp; However, there appears to be no way to&nbsp;transfer my favorites per my question, meaning there is no window that opens to find my Desktop Favorites folder on the new laptop and bring them
 in.&nbsp; Nor can I locate a favorites folder on the new laptop to move the Desktop Favorites into as there is for W7, unless someone can tell me where it is.

            <p>Discovered a way to import them.&nbsp; Open internet explorer separately from Edge.&nbsp; When Edge is open, use the import function and bring in the IE favorites.&nbsp; Both must be open at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2015/08/windows-10-import-favorites-in-edge.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll may need to organize them once imported.&nbsp; What doesn't work in Edge, so far, is to be able to put them in alphabetical order as you can with IE.&nbsp; Suspect an update will be issued to address this at some point in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on comments at the link above, appears this only works with IE, not Chrome, etc.</p>

<h2>            PNY 1GB DDR2 nVIDIA GeForce 210 Graphics Card</h2>
                    HI - I have installed the above graphics card into my Windows 7 Professional PC.&nbsp;However, despite downloading the latest drivers, Windows will not install the card. Although the video works fine - up to the maximum resolution of the&nbsp;monitor - no&nbsp;other&nbsp;adjustments
 are possible. When I run the Nvidia Control Panel I am told that there is no&nbsp;compatible&nbsp;hardware. I have made sure that there are no other Nvidia drivers on the machine. The most frustrating thing is that the PC cannot "hibernate" or "sleep"!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any suggestions.</div>

            Thanks for prompt&nbsp;response! The card is recognised in Device Manager - but no drivers are installed (even though they were installed at startup) Have removed and reinserted card - motherboard has video on board - in the BIOS only reference to it is to
 be able to select "Primary Video Source" - have selected PCI ex (where the card is installed.
