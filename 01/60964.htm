<h2>            My computer doesn&#39;t wake properly from sleep, the power is on but it just gives a black screen </h2>
                    well my pc sleeps properly the problem is when I press the power button again to wake it up the power turns on and the green lights are on but it doesn't send any signal to the monitor so all what I get is the black screen and the only way to get it back
 on is by doing a forceful restart by pressing the start button. by the way I previously had windows home basic installed on the same pc and I didn't have this problem, now I have windows home premium with service pack 2 and all available updates installed.
 any suggestions ????

<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - look at Power Management settings for Network Card,
<br />
WiFi, Modem, and other devices. (Double click the device and Power Management Tab)<br />
<br />
Set ALL power plans to the default and then set them as you wish. <br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
I would also update the major drivers especially video - recheck the Power Management
<br />
Settings after installing them.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually
<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)
<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Why Has My Surface Screen Changed Colours</h2>
                    <p>On the locked screen it is completely black with the time in the bottom left, on the start screen it is all black and each app has a white outline. Also, when bring up the keyboard on screen to type it is a white background with black keys and&nbsp;when the keys
 are pressed they flash blue. Also, the hyperlinks come up as yellow&nbsp;and I haven't changed any settings what so ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on my home from London, and I live on Liverpool, before I was departing I checked my surface a d it was fine all the colours where normal, in the car I had by my side for all the journey, I just never checked it. When I got home I checked it again
 and then on the locked screen it was all black with me asking for my password and with a yellow arrow.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really know what to do</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you would be satisfied&nbsp;with limiting the user to using any installed applications [rather than only being able to browse] then you could make it a Standard user account and set "User account control" to its maximum level - see
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Control panel</em>, </li><li><em>User accounts</em>,&nbsp;</li><li><em>Change user account control settings</em>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can limit a user to just using Edge or another "App" by setting up <em><span><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Assigned Access (Kiosk Mode)</span></span></em> - there is some guidance in

Set up Assigned Access (Kiosk Mode) - TenForums</a>. <br />
</p>
<p>If&nbsp;Edge is not the browser you want to use but your chosen browser is not available in the Windows store as an "App" then you could seek guidance&nbsp;in the IT admins forum -

<h3> daganeldr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install .Net framework 4.6.2 on Windows 7 &#40;SP1&#41; because &#39;setup has failed&#39;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all! New here, and this is my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I start, I'd like to mention that I've practically power washed through every link I could find on this in Google, yet I've come here, having no such luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is basically explained in this photo:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a89aff8-5d4c-4955-9263-52eb9bca0b66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a89aff8-5d4c-4955-9263-52eb9bca0b66" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You see, I've been trying to run a program that requires me to update my framework from 4.5 to 4.6. I'm certain it isn't already the version I have, as running the repair tool only picked up on 4.5 (and tried to fix it, with alleged success, only to have
 this still yet fail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What happens is that in perhaps the last 5% of the file installation (green bar as pictured), it stalls for a second, and then a pop up displays telling me the setup has failed. Despite this, the installation proceeds to the end, yet I cannot continue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ceb6969-0a65-4dfb-b2a4-47ff690dd5e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ceb6969-0a65-4dfb-b2a4-47ff690dd5e6" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do to fix this? At this point, is there anything at all? 4.5 framework installed fine, but 4.6 is where I'm having the serious problem. The offline installer did not help. I have run repair several times, and have tried installing from multiple
 downloads of the link and program. They always stop and have this problem at this point in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My operating system is Windows 7 64-bit. It's my most reliable PC, so I'm really hoping there's a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks. :)</p>

            <p>Hello! Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I feel there was a slight misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see, I <em>HAVE</em> to have .net framework 4.6.2 in order for the program that I'm trying to use to function properly.
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4.5.2</span></em> installed completely fine. No problems what so ever.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4.6.2</span></strong> will not move an inch in leniency when it comes to installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded all of the above-listed programs you gave me, yet sadly, no such luck. It still stalls on that one file in particular and then comes up with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I remember at one point a while back, before it stopped giving me a code to work with, it said something about verifying a signature or something like that. I googled it at the time, couldn't find anything, and decided to try later, but now this is where
 it ends up. I'll see if I can find the error I used to get.</p>

    <title>Password issues with W10 in Safe Mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password issues with W10 in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">Laptop: HP S</span><span>pectre x360</span></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">Operating System:&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft Windows 10 (64-bit)</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I went thru the basic setup on a brand new laptop and used the face recognition feature for logon.&nbsp; As I was having an issue with installing some software that runs on Win7, I was advised by the software vendor to install
 it on W10 in the Safe Mode (Run - msconfig - Normal selected on the Safe Mode page).&nbsp; The Safe Mode requires entering a password to logon; either I did not set that up in the basic setup or have forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Can I now revert to the normal mode (not Safe mode) so that the face recognition feature logs me on</p>
<p>2. If not is there some way to get back to the new laptop state to allow me to restart from the basic setup etc.</p>
<p>3. Is there any other option to get me out of this bind.&nbsp; This is a new laptop and I have no data or anything else installed on the system and hence am quite okay with a complete OS reinstall etc.</p>
<p>4. Does W10 setup allow a logon with just face recognition and does not mandate setting up an Administrator / User password. That would be an issue as in the Safe Mode the facial recognition software would be disabled.&nbsp;
 Is that also an issue with logging on using the finger print?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Rhans2001, 
<br />
<br />You might be able to reset the install by following the below:
<br />- Boot into safe mode
<br />- Hold down SHIFT while clicking the power icon
<br />- While holding down SHIFT, select restart
<br />- Hold SHIFT until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears 
<br />- Click Troubleshoot 
<br />- Click Advanced options 
<br />- Click Troubleshoot 
<br />- Click Reset this PC 
<br />- Continue through the remaining personal settings
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, I would suggest following this guide if you have the Windows bootable media (usually included with HP devices as either DVD or bootable USB): <a href="https://www.infopackets.com/news/9483/how-reset-any-password-windows-vista-7-8-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.infopackets.com/news/9483/how-reset...</a>

<p>Thank you Nathan for the very quick turnaround.&nbsp; I tried pressing the F11 key repeatedly while depressing the Power button. That brought up the Recovery options and a restore to Factory Settings allowed for a clean start and resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I realised the password required by the dialog box in Safe Mode was my MS email password...and all the while I was trying to recall whether I had set up any password for the Administrator.&nbsp; &nbsp;Guess that is one of the many differences between W10 and
 W7.</p>

    <title>Stop-VM gives message shutdown integration service is unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> photodood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop-VM gives message shutdown integration service is unavailable</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows Server 2012 machine running Hyper-V. I have multiple virtual machines running.&nbsp; I have a powershell script that attempts to use stop-vm to gracefully shut down the vm and restart it.&nbsp; I do this to bring the machine onto our domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the machine is added to the domain I do the stop-vm command (stop-vm -vm &lt;vmname&gt;).&nbsp; It works fine most of the time, but I have one machine, a Windows 8 machine that is being stubborn.&nbsp; Every time it says shutdown integration service is unavailable.&nbsp;
 I have done everything to this Windows 8 vm that I have done to the others.&nbsp; I have the Hyper-V Shutdown Service set to start up automatically, so I'm not sure why this is failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does fail on other machines randomly, and when I say randomly I mean it will fail and I will run the script again and it will be fine.&nbsp; I've increased wait times between starting the vm and doing the stop-vm command thinking that the VM just didn't have
 enough time to start properly, but that hasn't helped in this case.&nbsp; Because of other things I'm doing I currently have the firewall completely off on the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first Windows 8 machine I have tried this on.&nbsp; I have Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012&nbsp;virtual machines&nbsp;all working with the same script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can shutdown the machine from Hyper-V and from a PowerShell command prompt, just not when the whole script is executing.&nbsp; Sounds like the script.&nbsp; I'll have to investigate that aspect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any one have any clues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As is usually the case after I spend time posting a message to a forum, I figured out what was ultimately wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had not gotten enable-psremoting to work properly on the virtual machine. When I ran it I got a message about my network being public and it couldn't set things properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this message about changing a windows 8 machines network from public to private:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So it took me a while to find this also, I fixed it by searching for troubleshooting as suggested above. Then in the troubleshooting search box (top right) type homegroup, then select the homegroup troubleshooter, even if you are not using homegroup,
 part of the diagnostic allows you to change the network type from public to private/home, I skipped the network diagnostic step also and it allowed me to change the network type quite easily.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the final sequence to make everything work was:</p>
<p>While logged in as the local admin (the machine was not in a domain at this time):</p>
<p>Set network to private. Reboot.</p>
<p>Set enable-psremoting while logged in as Admin.</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Shut down and snapshot the vm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when I ran my script I was able to apply the proper snapshot, start the vm, join the domain, then shut-down the vm without errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that will help someone else some day.</p>

<h3> partridge4  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long should a System Restore take&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello out there.&nbsp; I have been having problems for several days with our laptop / Windows Vista home edition.&nbsp; It blue screened on me two days ago, kept running scandisk when I tried to reboot, froze repeatedly, and would not allow one of the users on (me!).&nbsp;
 It would just freeze...&nbsp; I have been "working" from my husband's user acct but cannot access mine.&nbsp; After cleaning out the startup menu and removing stuff we weren't using,&nbsp; I tried a System Restore.&nbsp; I went back to the last point before the problem began.&nbsp;
 It has been sitting there for almost three hours "preparing&nbsp;to restore your system"&nbsp;, however the hard drive light is not illuminating.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I have not ever attempted a restore before.<br />
<br />
I think I saw&nbsp;listing on the restore point list&nbsp;that there had been a Windows update that same day or the day prior.&nbsp; Could that be the problem?&nbsp; Prior to the blue screen, I had removed the usb plug for the extended keyboard we have installed.&nbsp; We do that fairly
 frequently when we move the laptop around....??<br />
<br />
There was a warning not to mess with the computer during the restore, so I don't know what to do.&nbsp; How long is long enough to wait?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any wisdom you have to offer....&nbsp; Thank you.

            Three hours is <strong>much</strong> longer than required to prepare to restore your system - it is frozen.&nbsp; It should only be a matter of minutes before it starts (a half hour means it's frozen again) - but the actual restore may take an hour or so (though
 probably nowhere near that long).&nbsp; You'll need to power down with the power button.&nbsp; Reboot to the Recovery Disk or to the genuine Vista Installation Disk and try to run the System Restore from there.&nbsp;
<span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
<span>Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates. </span><br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>

 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            This worked for me. &nbsp;first attempt was in standard mode. &nbsp;must have had "Preparing your system for repair" displaying for 7 or 8 hours. &nbsp;Read howtogeek linked article that recommended safe mode. &nbsp;second attempt was safe mode. &nbsp; &nbsp;was into repair in under
 a minute. &nbsp;restore done in 15-30 minutes. &nbsp;Windows warns against safe mode restore in the on board documentation. &nbsp;Not sure why, &nbsp;maybe it doesn't create a new recovery point in safe mode?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 8.1 and run my small business from it using a Samsung Notebook. &nbsp;On Saturday evening i had trouble with the speakers so closed everything down and did a restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restart is still going now 36 hours later. I have let it run because last time i took it in to my local repairers, they said some can go for 48 hours. &nbsp;Trouble is, i need to use it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You advice relates to Vista - can you please help re 8.1?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Sally</p>

<h2>            How to set a default account in calendar for Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new Win 10 calendar app, you don't seem to be able to set the default account for new events to something other than the MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an outlook account added to the calendar app, and when I add a new event, I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always </span>have to set the event to be saved as/in the Outlook calendar. The MS account option can not be deleted or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a fix?</p>

<p>Microsoft has updated the program. It now defaults to the last calendar you selected. Select your default calendar to make your first event. Once you save your new event, the calendar that was selected will automatically be&nbsp;selected from now on.</p>

<p>Vice City would be cool, then again both 3 and Vice City would be cool to re-release like San Andreas. Not to complain, but it seems strange that they re-release San Andreas but not the former two of the trilogy.

<h2>            Computer A can connect to Computer B not not the other way around</h2>
                    <p>I've run into this type of network issue a few times in the last year and each time the solution is different. I am now stuck again.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My DBServer computer (Win10 1709) can see and connect to my Dev computer (also Win10 1709) but my Dev computer can see but NOT connect to DBServer. By connect I mean see file shares. I get this message: Windows cannot access \\NEWDBSERVER. Error code: 0x80070035
 The network path was not found. I get the same error when I try to browse DBServer's shares from DBServer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can RDP into that computer and my I can connect to the database on that computer via ODBC, and I can see the other two computers on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>Rey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the article. I went through all of the steps (that I had not already tried) on both computers including full network reset and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot see a share on DBServer from Dev and DBServer cannot even see its own shares. I get&nbsp;<span>0x80070035 The network path was not found under both scenarios.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>If I factory reset an xbox 360 can I &#40;1&#41; reuse my current xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cadams003  say:</h3>
<h2>            If I factory reset an xbox 360 can I &#40;1&#41; reuse my current xbox live subscription key and &#40;2&#41; use a new DOB &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox LIve was originally setup for my younger son so now has age restrictions imposed by EA Sports which are preventing online gaming (FIFA 14).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping to get around this by factory resetting the xbox, then setting up the subscription again with the older DOB.</p>

<p>Can I reuse the subscription key, which still has 10 months to go ?</p>
<p>will it accept a new DOB that way or would it retain the original DOB ?</p>
<p>If it wont accept a new DOB there would be no point doing the console reset...</p>

<p>Can anyone verify this as a valid solution or offer alternative suggestions ?</p>

<p>There's nothing you can do about the age.Once you set the dob on an account then thats it,you can't change it.</p>
<p>Doing a factory reset will only reset your console,not any accounts on the console.</p>

<p>As stated a console reset will not change this. Only hope is to contact MS and see if they can do anything.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My advice in future or for anyone who shares an online account with a child is to set it up as an adult and then educate and monitor the child so they cant get upto any mischief.</p>

<p>You can try phoning support &amp; they may cancel the account &amp; give you a code for the remaining xbox live but the chances are slim as there is nothing actually wrong with the account.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, saves me some wasted time and my son lots of frustration. I think my best bet is to beg MS to move the subscription to an adult account. You're right there is nothing wrong with the account or the console per se, its the new age rules
 by EA that shouldnt even apply in UK, but trying to get help or even a response from EA is like expecting to get an in-form Messi in a bronze pack.... Yeah, thats just not gonna happen.
</p>
<p>If I do get anywhere with this, I'll come back and update. </p>

<p>Re the age 13 thing - I thought it must be a new rule because age restrictions are not mentioned anywhere when you buy the game as far as I have been able to determine and the PEGI 3 suggest kid friendly. We paid extra for the UE version which gets free
 stuff but not any more, so surely there should be some advisory with it. Youngest had no problem for 2 months, it just cut him off overnight a few weeks ago... &nbsp;Not a MS issue though, its all on EA. Gotta say as a parent of a now very miserable kid, I HATE
 EA SPORTS ! &nbsp;&lt;/rantoverfornow&gt;</p>

<p>Section driver updates. </p>
<p>How I can remove and disable these updates?</p>
<p>It's not first time MS pushes wrong firmware on Surface 3 pro. Just how I can remove it without resetting Surface to complete clean slate?
</p>
<p>Another question what I need to do to be able to select updates? It all really fun to reformat your work tool again and again like whole 2 week worth of vacation time spent on fixing it.
