<p>Well, I'll do my best. &nbsp;ESRB lets parents make informed decisions about what content they want their children exposed to. &nbsp;The ESRB rating is based on the content the developers have put into the video game. &nbsp;When you play a game online, you're no longer
 just exposed to what the developers have put into it; you're now subject to experiences being provided by other players. &nbsp;Since the ESRB cannot rate the players you'll encounter online, they created the disclaimer that the rating may change in those circumstances.
 &nbsp;For example, you might be playing a family-friendly game of UNO online, but someone you're playing with could start cussing up a storm, which would exceed the expectations of an ESRB E For Everyone rating.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>While some trash talking is expected in games, Xbox LIVE Terms of Use do not condone being abusive, and there are standards about the kind of language you use online.&nbsp; Just like with your profile bio, you need to use caution and common sense regarding how
 you communicate with the outside world when operating from within the Xbox LIVE network, and the expectations of players on the network may differ from the content put forth by developers in games, regardless of a game's ESRB rating.</p>

<p>I don't think this will happen for online gaming, it was meant for the video making app or program. If they see swearing in the videos, they could have free reign to ban you. I think it's dumb though that they're doing this.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>external hard disk which are compatible with new update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            external hard disk which are compatible with new update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I was wondering which external hard disk are compatible to use with the new update that lets us use up to 2TB external storage. I read&nbsp; online and some friends have told me that not every external hard disk is compatible, some seagates were mentioned
 mostly. Is there an official list somewhere to know which ones are safe to buy.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I'm using a WD Elements 1TB USB 3.0 portable hard drive.</p>
<p>I believe a USB 2.0 drive is required but USB 3.0 is backwards compatibile. Also i'm assuming that you are less likely to have performance problems if the drive is USB 3.0 due to the fact that the speed will drop to maximum USB 2.0 speed when connected to
 the 360.</p>
<p>I can't find a list anywhere yet although i'm assuming if a drive works with the xbox one it will work with the 360.</p>
<p>Also don't worry if a drive you buy has NTFS on it as the 360 will be able to format it to FAT32 to make it compatible</p>

<p>stay away from seagate until further notice. they are hit and miss with less than 20% success rate. western digital have a higher success rate for working. i as well am using a elements hdd but i have a 2 tb and it works perfectly.
</p>
<p>the only thing Malacath isnt correct about is the compatibility between xbox one and 360 this is why people were going to seagate to begin with other than that their information is spot on.
</p>
<p>also wanted to point out you may have moving issues when using this feature. its random at best youll never know which game wont move.</p>
<p>i am part of the preview program this is why i know a little more</p>

<p>You're whole set up is so unclear I have no idea where to post this one, but here we go. I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, he said I wasn't on his friends list but when I looked at mine he was there. Next part was just weird, we kick each other
 from partys for fun, just a mess around. But when I kicked him from mine he vanished from my friends list. Again, we've been close friends for five whole years, &nbsp;so its just a mess around. &nbsp;Anyhow I want to know if you can give me an answer on this one cause
 it was just freay how it happened.</p>

<p>@Deathspankd</p>
<p>I'm not in the 360 preview program so didn't know about the seagates so thanks for bringing that up.</p>
<p>I think MS should put a stickied thread up warning people not to buy one.</p>
<p>@MEszlHD</p>
<p>Your problem is totally unrelated to external hard drives which is what this thread is about so you should start a new one. You'll be more likely to get help if you create your own thread.</p>

<p>@Malacath i think youre correct about the sticky. im surprised they havent given any warning via subtext on the update splash page on dashboard or their update support page. which is odd because we have had the hdd update for like a month and a half prior
 to the release of the official update so most issues should be known by now.</p>
<p>@MEszIHD your issue is related to service alerts once they fix the issue your problem will be resolved. next time make youre own thread though so we can keep everything on topic

<p>First of all I don't think copying games to your laptop is allowed. Probably still a violation of Terms of service.</p>
<p>But yes you can now connect &nbsp;a hard drive up to 2TB and store your games on that.</p>
<p>Just don't buy a hard drive larger than 2TB and don't buy a seagate as a lot of people are having problems with those.</p>

<p>Hi, I am part of the preview program and have ordered a toshiba 1tb usb3 drive. The question I have is: I have the old style 360 (the one with the ms hard drive that bolts onto the top/left end of the console using component to connect for visual and optical
 for sound) as I don't have enough hdmi inputs on my a/v amplifier. As the component input on the 360 is above the rear usb it so big it blocks off the usb. Can I connect the hard drive to the front usb and when I upgrade my amplifier/av unit so I can go hdmi
 on the 360, switch the usb to the rear without any issues such as the 360 'locking' the hard disk to the front usb or suchlike? Many thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Error: Email address or password is not valid (80151103, 8015D000, 8015d02e)</p>
<p>Xbox Windows Live ID problem</p>
<p>This describes what to do if you get an error message when you try to do one of these things:</p>
<p>Sign in on your console or at Xbox.com</p>
<p>Change the Windows Live ID associated with your Xbox LIVE account</p>
<p>Create an Xbox LIVE account</p>
<p>These are the error messages you might get:</p>

<p>"This profile cannot be downloaded right now. Status Code 8015D000"</p>

<p>From what I know I can only change the Windows ID associated with the account while signed into the account on xbox which I cant do. My ID got hacked a while ago and was used to spam people with viruses. Some parts of Windows live is banned from my use.
 Could this also be microsoft? But I can login to Xbox.com. So I think there is an issue with my ID.</p>

<p>You can't do anything with your gamertag if your email address was blocked for spam. When you sign in, it should mention something about the account being blocked and how to unblock it. At the most, you need to go to
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com">http://answers.microsoft.com</a> and go to the windows live section. They are the only ones that can unblock your live id.

<p>This thread is old, but for those that don't know, if you have a blocked Microsoft Account, meaning you can sign in, but it's saying your account is blocked you need to first try the steps that are provided when you sign in, try resetting the password itself,

<p><br />
As the D drive is completely empty, i.e. unwanted data on it, you may be able to use some of its space to extend drive C.</p>
<p>Right-click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management to show the current partitions from left to right. If drive D is immediately to the right of C in the graphical layout, your luck is in, so:</p>
<p>1. Right-click the D graphic and choose Delete to leave Unallocated space.<br />
2. Right-click the C graphic and choose Extend and select the amount of space you want to extend it by.<br />
3. Any space that you left in (2) can be set up as a new (smaller) drive D by right-clicking it and creating a New Simple Volume and Formatting it.</p>

    <title>Overheating gpu connection cause to black screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giulianobasso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overheating gpu connection cause to black screen.</h2>
                    Hello, i have problem of black screens. i have already made a topic about hot to fix the black screens. I found by my self what is the problem. My GPU connection is getting overheating fast. i tried to use msi afterburner to see what will happen if i will
 play a game and my result is that this is the temperature. underclocking the gpu won't help to cool down the gpu. its summer now and i live in a hot place. so this is a big problem. i added more fan that is aim on the gpu connection. its helping but not enough.
 what can i do to cool down the gpu connection? &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>Overclocking the GPU will definitely not help with the overheating problem, in fact it will more than likely make it worse!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would check that the thermal paste between the heat-sink and the GPU (you will have to buy some before you check it as you may break the seal by checking it, If that is not seated correctly, then the card will become overly hot . . .</p>

</p><p>Though I would like to note that model of GPU does have a habit of overheating - checkout the end of

    <title>Windows 7 File Sharing Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timfontana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 File Sharing Errors</h2>
                    <p>Afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC that I am currently working on whereby I am entirely unable to access network shares.</p>
<p>I've followed all the steps I found online regarding the configuration but am still unable to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC in question (M1 henceforce) is running Windows 7.</p>
<p>Firewall is off and shares are configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this PC if I navigate to \\M1 I see the list of share</p>
<p>If I click any of the shares, I get an error (file and print sharing resource (m1) is online but isn't responding to connection attempts.</p>
<p>The remote computer isn’t responding to connections on port 445, possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldn’t find any problems with the firewall on your computer. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs when on M1 navigating to M1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If on another PC (testing using a PC called M4) I go to \\M1; I get the above error without being able to see the list of shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reversing the process (sharing on M4 and navigating from M1 to \\M4) the issue does not occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>External HDD, when playing a Video in VLC or other etc. slows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jr serdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            External HDD, when playing a Video in VLC or other etc. slows</h2>
                    I actually noticed this earlier today, I plug my External HDD into my PC and I notice its slowing a bit and I decided to watch a random Movie and when I run the video in VLC the playback was sometimes lagging/freezing in some seconds and tried to pause
 it but didn't worked i tried to click the spacebar many times before the video paused and play it again i thought it was fixed but when i tried adding subs but when I'm adding it I hear the sounds but the video freeze so I was pissed off watching it and tried
 in the Video App of Win 8,1 but some parts were still lagging/freezing then it will play. I don't know the problem I tried troubleshooting it by Error Checking in the Tools and Defragmenting the HDD and restart my PC and still nothing happens, I even tried
 it on my Laptop with a 3.0 USB but its the same.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my External HDD is TOSHIBA MQ01ABD100 AX001U 1TB</div>

            <p>Hi Jr Serdon,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to outdated or incompatible display driver. If the issue is specific for the files stored on the external hard drive, it might also be an issue with the hard drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>What exactly are you referring to when you say hard drive is slowing a bit? Are you trying to say that it takes time to access the files on it?</li><li>What if you play videos or media files locally stored on the computer? Do you still have that lagging issue?</li><li>What is the Make and Model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>First of all, if you haven’t tried, try connecting the hard drive to a different computer and check if the same issue occurs. If yes, then, it could be an issue with the hard drive.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, try playing the video files that are stored on the computer and check if they lag.
</p>
<p>For further troubleshooting, follow the methods:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Check if the same issue occurs in safe mode. Refer to the link to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>If you are able to access the files easily and the video files don’t lag, proceed to the next step.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the manufacturer website of the computer to download and install the latest display driver for Windows 8.1. Make sure that you uninstall the current version and then install the latest ones that you have downloaded.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Check if that fixes the issue. If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Let’s place the computer in a clean boot state and check if there is any third party application that is causing the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<b>Windows 8</b>”</p>
<p>You can refer to the section “<b>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</b>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Please refer to the section:<b> How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Please reply to us with the status of this issue. </p>

            <p>Hi Jr Serdon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try finding out whether the issue is specific to the external hard drive. What I would suggest you is to copy the files to a different external hard drive and check if the same issue persist.

<p>
</p><p>Do let us know about the status of this issue after following the methods.</p>

            I have tried copying same files in my other External Hard Drive but no problems occur, and I've tried watching it directly from there and no lagging what do you think seems to be the issue?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to issues with that specific external&nbsp;hard drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the contents on the external hard drive to the computer and then format the hard drive. Bring the contents back to the hard drive and see if the issue still occur.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that you create a backup copy for the external hard drive before
<span>
formatting it. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>If the issue still persists and as it's specific to this hard drive, you can contact Toshiba support. Refer to the link to contact them:</p>

</p><p>None of the solutions presented here work. The level one Microsoft Answer Desk&nbsp;makes several&nbsp;attempts to do to do&nbsp;the different steps listed here to no avail&nbsp;and then wants to do a system restore.&nbsp; Trust me!&nbsp; Never allow them to do this!&nbsp; If you allow it,
 you will have to reinstall all applications not installed through the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; Unless you never used your computer before September 30th, it can take you days, weeks or even months to get back to where you were before making this mistake.&nbsp; You also
 may have to pay for new installs of any&nbsp;third-party software.&nbsp; The support people at the Microsoft Answer Desk will try to convince you multiple times that&nbsp;you that you will not lose anything.&nbsp; Do not believe them!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I speak from experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. You will also lose historical&nbsp;update information each time they remove folders trying to get this update to install.&nbsp; The support staff are doing everything following step-by-step written instructions.&nbsp; They do not understand what&nbsp;are they are doing.&nbsp;
 The problem is not your software.&nbsp; It is something in the update that is not done properly.&nbsp; Granted, it may be something to do with the default permissions on our computers.&nbsp; Good look luck figuring this out.&nbsp; Apparently, There is either no log file created
 during the update process or level one support staff are not trained in reviewing the&nbsp;log file.</p>

            They really don't know what they're doing. They are trained to "pretend" they know, and when all else fails they suggest a system restore which is a punk-out on their part. Lousy!

            Can you view available wireless networks in the bottom right corner of the screen? Check device manager and see if your wireless nic is there without an x over it. If there is an X, click on it, click uninstall and restart the computer. Try connecting
 again. Can you connect with an ethernet cable? If so, go to the router manufacturers website, locate your model and download the latest firmware. Dowload the latest wireless nic driver as well.

                    It just randomly started today...I wasn't doing anything abnormal. &nbsp;All of a sudden the keyboard wasn't acting normal. &nbsp;Certain buttons bring up specific things (like s for save, n for new). &nbsp;It seems like a filter key or sticky key&nbsp;situation&nbsp;but they
 are boy turned off. &nbsp; Any advice? &nbsp;Oh and the problem goes away temporarily if I restart/log out.

<h2>            Black box appears when hovering the mouse above a desktop icon</h2>
                    My operating system is windows 8.1, 64-bit,&nbsp; all the updates have been down loaded and installed.&nbsp;Recently when I pass the mouse over an icon on the desktop it creates a black box around the icon. If I continue to move the mouse around on the desktop it
 will create a black box around those icons, then after awhile the black boxes will disappear. Everything seems to be operating correctly when the black boxes appear. What can a person look for to get rid of the black boxes?&nbsp;

    <title>Multi-Monitor and iGPU and dGPU usage&#47;load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi-Monitor and iGPU and dGPU usage&#47;load</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have trouble getting my iGPU to do work when the dGPU is set as "main display".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an iGPU Intel HD4000 on my 3770k CPU, I also have a dGPU Nvidia GTX690 in a Multi-Monitor setup. Connected to my GTX690 are 3 monitors, and connected to my HD4000 is a 4th accessory display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when I play a video using VLC on the monitor connected to the iGPU, all content is actually rendered on the dGPU, then sent over the PCIe bus to the iGPU and displayed from there. I don't want my dGPU adapter to have anything to do with
 VLC when the window is not on those monitors. I want only my iGPU adapter to do work when VLC is on that respective monitor. If I move the VLC window over to a different monitor which is powered by another display adapter, I want that adapter to take over
 the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example - Playing a video <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on the Monitor connected to iGPU</span></em>:</p>
<p>1. When <strong>i</strong>GPU is set as Main Display then; &nbsp;iGPU 17% usage, dGPU1 0%, dGPU2 0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When <strong>d</strong>GPU&nbsp;is set as Main Display then; iGPU 18% usage, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
dGPU1 8%</span>, dGPU2 0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first case where the monitor connceted to the iGPU is set as main display, everything works as I want it, only the iGPU does work as it outputs the video to its monitor. But I don't want to have my iGPU as Main Display, I want the dGPU as Main.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the second case where a monitor connceted to the GTX690 is set as the main display, dGPU1 is at 8% even though no monitor connceted to this Dispay adapter is displaying anything.... For some reason Windows10 lets the dGPU do all the work and pass the
 result to the iGPU which then displays it. I want the iGPU to do all the work.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I assign a different <strong>Display Adapter</strong> to a program, other then the "Main Display" (which all programs default to, regardless of which monitor they actually appear on)???</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Nvidia has something called "Nvidia Optimus" but is only available for mobile devices. But this is not available for desktop. Does Win10 have something like it where I can pick which GPU a program will use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that there&nbsp;is no option to&nbsp;pick which GPU a program will use. I suggest you to contact the graphic card manufacturer for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you&nbsp;are using&nbsp;VLC player, suggest you&nbsp;to check if there are any settings in the player to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us for any other assistance with Windows, we'll be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 To Windows 10 Upgrade&#47;Downgrade</h2>
                    Hey, I have recently got my computer working OK but it still does have problems with it.I have Windows 7 Home Premium and I had upgraded to Windows 10,it was activated and working for a few days.But my computer started acting up and would go slow and bug
 out.Eventually it would not turn on and ask me to troubleshoot Windows.I gave up trying to do it and forced myself to use the Windows 7 Home Premium re installation disc to wipe my hard drive completely and reinstall Windows.When I did I installed necessary
 drives,downloaded Google Chrome and tried using the Windows 10 installation assistant/free upgrade.Now it is stuck at 99% installing Windows 10 and I reinstalled Win 7 twice and tried again.Currently it is still stuck at 99% installing please hep!

<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DirectPlay&nbsp;is a deprecated API that was part of&nbsp;Microsoft's&nbsp;DirectX&nbsp;API. DirectPlay is a network communication library intended for&nbsp;computer game&nbsp;development, although its general nature certainly allows it to be used for other
 purposes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DirectPlay is a high-level software interface between applications and communication services that makes it easy to connect games over the&nbsp;Internet, a&nbsp;modem&nbsp;link, or a&nbsp;network. DirectPlay features a set of tools that allow players
 to find game sessions and sites to manage the flow of information between hosts and players. It provides a way for applications to communicate with each other, regardless of the underlying online service or protocol. DirectPlay also resolves many connectivity
 issues, such as&nbsp;NAT.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DirectPlay, as the rest of DirectX, runs in COM and it is accessed through&nbsp;COM&nbsp;(Component Object Model)&nbsp;interfaces. By default, DirectPlay uses&nbsp;multi-threaded&nbsp;programming techniques and requires careful thought to avoid the usual
 threading issues. Since DirectX version 9, this issue can be alleviated at the expense of efficiency.</span></p>

    <title>Best audio setting for 360&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> undeadcreepshow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best audio setting for 360&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new headset and I'm wondering what digital output setting is best? &nbsp;I hooked this headset to my PC and it gives out really good bass on there but when hooked to my 360 it barely gives any bass at all. I guess what setting is the most immersive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The digital output setting only selects whether you will get 5.1 Dolby Digital sound or 2.0 sound over the digital outputs (optical output and HDMI).</p>
<p>If your headset has an amplifier which supports Dolby Digital and your Xbox 360 is connected to it from its optical output, I recommend setting the Xbox 360 to Dolby Digital.</p>
<p>If you take the sound from your TV and it's connected over HDMI, the digital output setting on the Xbox 360 will only affect the sound output if the TV reports that it accepts Dolby Digital. Otherwise, the sound will stay 2.0 stereo.</p>
<p>Also, when the Xbox 360 outputs 2.0 stereo, the 5 main channels of the game are downmixed to stereo with matrix encoding - that is, the surrounds are mixed into the left and right channels out-of-phase. This lets the surround be decoded by a decoder such
 as Dolby Pro Logic II, creating an approximation of the original mix. The low frequency effects (LFE) channel from the 5.1 mix is left out though in the downmix to 2.0, as there often won't be enough dynamic headroom for it.</p>
<p>If you listen to the 2.0 stereo output from the Xbox 360 as-is over headphones, because of the matrix encoding of the surround channels, sounds originating from behind you will appear to have an undistinct placement or appear to come from behind you but
 sound a bit strange. Our hearing uses time differences and phase to determine if sounds are coming from behind us, but the completely out-of-phase encoding of the surrounds in the 2.0 mix is a bit beyond what we're used to hearing in real life.</p>
<p>On your PC, there may also be settings active which boost the bass when you have the headset plugged in, and the overall handling of sound mixing might be different even if you play the PC version and Xbox 360 version of the same game.</p>
<p>Sorry if this got a bit technical, but it's hard to avoid getting into those aspects when determining what the best setting is and why things may sound different from what you'd expect.</p>

    <title>HELP, Pc this morning said updating apps for 10 minutes. Lost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackdashack  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP, Pc this morning said updating apps for 10 minutes. Lost everything and almost total function&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My HP desktop with Windows 8.1 said it was updating apps this morning for about 10 minutes. Never seen that before. The entire screen was changing colors that I associate with the Metro colors. Reports came like, Taking care of Stuff, Do not turn off your
 pc, Please wait, Almost there ... etc. After that it went to a blank screen, a grey taskbar and a white metro start button which does nothing. When I start the task manager it says there are no processes running. I have a recovery stick but there is so much
 to lose if I do that. Although I have files backup thankfully. I still have not figured out how to get into safe mode and see if I can use a prior restore. I do get a flash screen, then a logon where I can put my password, all looks normal. Then it goes to
 this black blank screen with the useless Metro start button in the bottom left.&nbsp; I would appreciate help so much!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get into Task Manager and it has no one listed under USERS?</p>
<p>No processes listed?</p>
<p>If I try to run Explorer from Task Manager it says "The server could not be started because the configured identity is incorrect. Check the Username and Password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp; jack&nbsp; ":-\\ </p>
