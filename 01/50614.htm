<h2>            Xbox one Halo&#58; Master chief collection has gone missing&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I am sorry for any misspellings I may have in this post.<br />
<br />
I bought halo: MMC on release. I have played it a lot. <br />
<br />
this was a few years ago now. and I thought about playing it again but on my xbox one it is not in my games anymore.
<br />
I have puchased this as a digital download and am unable to find it to download it.
<br />
In the games section it doesnt show that i own it and asks for a download code. <br />
How can i solve this problem? xbox or microsoft support is impossible to get ahold of.

<p>If it shows that you need to purchase it or enter a code in the store that means the account you are signed into does not have the license for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be caused by a couple different things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It was purchased on a different account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It was refunded for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are signed into the account that you believe purchased the game then you can double check the purchase history by signing into the account at account.microsoft.com and looking at the order history there and it should show you whether the purchase
 is still showing as completed or refunded or what the status of the order is currently.</p>

<p>Please sign in with the account that you purchased the game with at <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and check your purchase history on that account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the game doesn't show up there on the list, try to remember if you used a different account in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this page contains tax relevant information (that has to be kept for at least 10 years in some countries), you can be sure that the game will show up there if you bought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there were a tax relevant purchase missing from that list, the federal tax bureau would be all over Microsoft to find that purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it doesn't show up there on the list, you probably bought it on a different account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still need to contact Microsoft Xbox Support, you might have to do a little trial and error on the support page, depending on the country you're in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> and go to the category about Billing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some countries have a dedicated billing section with a credit card symbol, others have the icon of a person and it's about "Account and billing".&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a virtual agent shows up, click on the "Show other methods" to dismiss the virtual agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you need to try several sub-topics. Click on each topic in the list, and click on the show contact options button at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the category you chose, the time of day and availability, several tiles should appear at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among these tiles should be tiles to "chat with Xbox support" or to "Request a call", where support will call you on your phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Microsoft driver" is far too generic a description.&nbsp; What specific driver are you trying to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message you quoted -- "entry point AddDllDirectory could not be located" -- refers to a programming label inside some file.&nbsp; Again, this doesn't specify
<strong>which </strong>file is missing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the Title Bar of the window in which the error message popped up would have provided a clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you restore from a manufacturer's recovery partition, all the necessary drivers are already included.</p>
<p>Now, all of that being said ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the AddDllDirectory function is a new feature that Microsoft added to Windows 8.&nbsp; It was not present in the release version of Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why a Windows 7 system restored from a recovery partition would be attempting to use this function, but the way to get it for Windows 7 is to install KB2533623.&nbsp; See

<h2>            Error code 0xc0000225 Lenovo Yoga 2 Tablet</h2>
                    Hi, I tried to upgrade my Lenovo Yoga 2 tablet to windows 10. It was upgrading overnight and when I woke up the next morning to turn it on, the blue screen appeared displaying the error code message. After reading some posts online about the issue, I downloaded
 windows 10 on a flash USB drive. Now when I insert the flash drive and turn the power on, a Windows Setup dialog box appear on the screen with the option to continue the upgrade or perform a clean installation, but now I face another problem. I can't click
 on the screen to select a option as the screen is completely unresponsive to the touch. My screen worked perfectly until I tried upgrading to Windows 10. I can't use the attached keyboard as it only connects to the tablet via bluetooth. How can I fix my tablet
 if I can't get my screen to work?

<p>
</p><p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won‚Äôt be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when
 your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to restart your system once and if you still get the blue screen error I suggest you to refer to the article below and check the troubleshooting steps provided and see if it helps:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This issue may be resolved by using Vssadmin command. </font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>a: </strong>Open a <strong>command prompt</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Type <strong>Vssadmin list shadowstorage</strong></p>
<p><strong>c: </strong>Take note of what the shadow storage allocation is on the drive you're having issues with, it usually is &nbsp;C:</p>
<p><strong>d: </strong>Change the allocation by using the Vssadmin command, syntax:
<em>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=1G (where Maxsize=the amount of disk space you've allocated to System Restore points.&nbsp;Usually it is&nbsp;20 GB<br />
</em><strong>e: </strong>In the case of the C: drive, the syntax would be VSSAdmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize =20G</p>

            <p><em>PLease see if the following answer is useful:</em></p>
<p>=====================================================</p>
<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>I would suggest you to modify the permission settings on the folder or the hard drive on which you are unable to create or modify or delete files.</p>
<p>Follow the below Steps:</p>
<p>1. Right click on the file or directory. <br />
2. Click on ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù on the right click menu. <br />
3. Click on ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù tab. <br />
4. Click on ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù button at the bottom. <br />
5. In Advanced Security Dialog window, click on ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù tab. <br />
6. Here you will be able to see current owner (i.e. Trusted Installer). <br />
7. To take ownership of the object, click on the Edit button. Give permission to UAC. Then highlight the user name in the ‚ÄúChange owner to‚Äù box that you want to assign as the owner for the object. Click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to finish the process.<br />
8. Back in Advanced Security Settings window, you will see the current owner has changed to the user you just selected.<br />
9. Click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button to exit this window. <br />
10. Click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù again to exit completely from the Properties window. <br />
11. Repeat step 1 to 4 to open the object‚Äôs Properties window again. <br />
12. Back in object‚Äôs Properties window, click on Edit button, and confirm the UAC elevation request.<br />
13. Highlight the Administrators in the ‚ÄúGroup or user names‚Äù box. If the user ID or group that you want to manage the permissions for the object doesn‚Äôt exist, click on ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button, and type in the user name or group name desired into the ‚ÄúEnter object names
 to select (Can use Everyone as user Name)‚Äù box, and finish off by clicking on ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.<br />
14. In the Permissions for Administrators box below (or any other user name or group name you chose), click on ‚ÄúFull Control‚Äù under the ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù column to assign full access rights control permissions to Administrators group.</p>

            <p>Hi KA,</p>
<p>I also have the problem with "Windows 10 upgrade stuck at "Starting Download..." I do not have a problem with Windows update, only with the Windows 10 upgrade download. The troubleshooter does not show any problems with windows update. Windows updates install
 without problem. Before I try stop/start windows update services, I would appreciate an answer that addresses the specific question of Windows 10 upgrade stuck at "Starting Download...", please.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>JP#&amp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 4/18/2016:</p>
<p>AHAH! I found the answer to my problem. I had been using the GWX control panel to prevent&nbsp;a forced upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 until I was ready for it. When I was ready to proceed with the upgrade, I used the GWX control panel to re-enable the
 upgrade, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or so I thought</span>. It turned out that somewhere in the process of disabling and re-enabling the upgrade, the registry entry that prevents the upgrade was not reset. I found the
<strong>DisableOSUpgrade</strong>" DWORD entry value set to 1.</p>
<p>I downloaded the latest version of the GWX control panel and it correctly showed that the Windows 10 upgrade was disabled. I used the GWX control panel to re-enable the upgrade, and checked the registry. The DisableOSUpgrade DWORD no longer appeared in the
 registry. I was then able to successfully proceed with the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</p><p>Sometimes the PC restarts itself after the cursor becomes unresponsive. Once I was presented with a blue-screen that said something about "clock_watchdog_timeout".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these were all new parts I would have assumed there was a hardware problem; but the PC runs perfectly on the hard-drive, albeit very slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing all unessential USB hardware, connected my old mouse and keyboard, updated the UEFI firmware, updated the AM4 chipset, graphics, LAN and audio drivers. I even tried a fresh install on another hard-drive and the PC still locks up. Windows
 update is having trouble completing because the PC keeps locking up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            hi Rans.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try removing a stick of RAM to test it without it, then change sticks.  Check for debris in slots to blow out, reseat firmly.
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />Run the Crucial scanner to make sure specs are precise and have no leeway:  <a href="https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm_re=us-footer-_-us-upgrade-_-us-upgrade-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Compare the install you did with the gold standard in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Did you delete all partitions off the drive during install?  It's not clean otherwise.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works do the above install exactly, but immediately after install check performance after each group of Updates installs, each program/app install, each settings change, no tweaks whatsoever.  Use System Restore points as you go so you can go back if you isolate the problem.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. The issue seems to be resolved now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get all of the Windows updates installed after a few more crashes, and it seems one of the updates fixed the freezing issue. Strangely, Chrome stopped working after the final large Windows update (no connection to the web; whereas Edge and Firefox
 worked fine), and I was getting strange issue where the PC would hang for a few seconds every couple of minutes... Both of these issue went away after creating a new Windows user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a new user account would have fixed the hard crashes I was getting before the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your suggestions :)</p>
        </p>

            Glad to hear about your progress.  
<br />
<br />Chrome can also sometimes be fixed by a Reset or reinstall:

<br />
<br />But a new account also can clear away a lot of corruption.
<br />
<br />Let us know if there's anything else.

            i also have had this problem it started first with the blue screen last jan i fixed that and and uninstalled and reinstalled updates then the freezing started so i did the fresh start from my recovey screen that didnt work so i went and bought the windows
 10&nbsp; disc an did the complete clean install since i thought this must be because i upgraded from windows 7 but still i am having this freezing problem as soon as it updates. one of these updates should send out a solution to this problem that i see so many
 people are having because the signing in with a different account did not resolve it i have 4 accounts and eventually it will freeze again

<h3> david marcus  say:</h3>
<h2>            QuickEdit Mode Broken in Command Prompt and cmd</h2>
                    I can't get QuickEdit mode to work in any Command Prompt (cmd) window. I have QuickEdit Mode checked in Properties and also in Defaults. I can copy and paste using the menu, but I can't select or paste using the mouse. I think this worked at some point
 in the past, but I don't try it that often, so I can't be sure. The problem is the same if I open the command prompt from the shortcut in the Start menu or type "cmd" in the Run box.All the QuickEdit values in the registry under HKCU/Console and its subkeys
 are set to 1. I'm using Vista Home Premium, version 6.0.6002.<br />

            <div>Hi David Marcus,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are few tips that will help you perform copy and paste operations when Quickedit mode is enabled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to Copy and Paste When QuickEdit Mode Is Enabled</strong></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>To copy text from the command prompt window, click and drag the mouse pointer over the text that you want to copy, and then either press ENTER or right-click anywhere in the window.<br />
<br />
The text is copied to the Windows clipboard. <br />
<br />
<b>NOTE</b>: If you select text in an MS-DOS-based program, the selection is always rectangular-shaped, even if the lines of text have to be truncated on the left side, the right side, or on both sides. In contrast, when you select text in a Windows-based program,
 your selection follows the flow of your text, even if the text is not formed in a rectangular block.
</li><li>To paste the text from the Windows clipboard to the command prompt window, right-click anywhere in the window.
<br />
<br />
The text is pasted to the command prompt window. </li></ol>
<b>NOTE</b>: You cannot paste text to either a command prompt window or an MS-DOS-based program if either the command prompt or the program is running in full-screen mode.

            When I click and drag, nothing happens. Nothing is highlighted. When I right-click nothing is pasted. If I go to another program, e.g., Notepad, and paste, I can check that nothing was copied from the command prompt window.<br />

            <p>For years, I have used QuickEdit literally hundred of times a day.&nbsp; But the last few days, it has stopped working reliably for me.&nbsp; I have "cleared" the problem with a reboot, but it reappears within a couple days.&nbsp; I'm running XP Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when it's not working, I see the title bar of the Command Prompt window change to "Select Comment Prompt" as I click and drag.&nbsp; The hilighted area is un-hilighted when I press enter.&nbsp; But when I try to paste into a DOS window or a real window, nothing
 happens.&nbsp; If I use the Edit menu instead of the mouse, I get the same result.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need for this to work again.&nbsp; Any help?</p>

<h3> pj venner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to save downloaded files, Please help.</h2>
                    
<div>Using Vista HP 32. When I try to save a downloaded file, it downloads [I monitored the folder I'm saving it to], but when the download is complete the file disappears from the folder.<br />
<br />
I use Firefox &amp; IE and it happens in both. <br />
<br />
My computer has a dual boot setup, I use XP just for gaming. I can boot to XP and download a file to the same folder and it works just fine, and it's still there when I go back to Vista.<br />
<br />
I've cleared my download history. I've deleted file associations with the files [I tried 2 different types of file each time]. I've rebooted between each attempt but the problem persists.<br />
<br />
I've already considered the infected file possibility and tried several different downloads, all from trusted sources, but I still have the problem and getting very frustrated! :(<br />
<br />
I've just installed Google Chrome, I had to reboot to XP to download/save it. Using Chrome I can now save downloaded files which helps, but the problem persists in IE &amp; FF, despite a clean re-install of FF.</div>

    <title>Scanner Issues using Brother MFC 465CN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malaub123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scanner Issues using Brother MFC 465CN</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a Brother MFC 465CN that I was using in Windows 7, with no issues. &nbsp;Now, that I've converted to Windows 10 I can not use my scanner. &nbsp;I keep getting an error: &nbsp;The scanner isn't available. &nbsp;Make sure the device is turned on and is connected
 to your computer or network. &nbsp;It is connected/has been disconnected/uninstalled-reinstalled. &nbsp;Still doesn't work. &nbsp;In fact, I also receive an error when I push the Scanner button on the printer now: &nbsp;Not Connected. &nbsp;I now don't even see the printer icon at
 the bottom right that show apps like: Bluetooth, Internet connection, etc... &nbsp;Any suggestions/help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Well, I don't think that worked. &nbsp;I'm now getting, when I press either the Scan button or the Photo Capture button on the Brother machine a: &nbsp;Check Connection-Scan; and Insert Media-Photo Capture button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating, and definitely not a user friendly fix. &nbsp;I'm wondering, if I will have to just live without being able to use my Scanner/Photo Capture now. &nbsp;Any other possible suggestions?</p>

            <p>I've had this problem with the scanner too, though the printer is installed and works fine. &nbsp;Here is the reply from Brother to my query, unfortunately I could not get Paint or Windows Fax and Scan to work (as neither see MFC465CN as a scanner, presumably
 because it's not installed as not showing up in Control Panel as a device ) they've referred it to Microsoft to solve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: "<span>Hi, I have followed your instructions from 9/25/15 to connect using USB but still no luck with getting scanner to work after I upgraded to Windows 10. I
 can print without any difficulty using either USB or wifi, but when I push the scan button on the MFC-465CN, it is still giving me a "Check Connection" error. I've unistalled and reinstalled the MFC 465CN driver couple of times, but this didn't solve it either."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A: "<span>Your Brother machine was developed before the release of this Windows operating system. Unfortunately, there are not original Brother drivers or software
 available for this machine and operating system combination. The only drivers that will work with the MFC-465CN and Windows 10 are the built in drivers that are provided by Microsoft.</span></p>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
I have included a link directly below that will assist with ensuring that these built in drivers are installed correctly.</div>

<div>
&nbsp;<br />
When pressing the Scan button on the machine, it normally connects to the Brother Control Center on the computer to scan. Since we do not offer a Control Center software for this model and operating system, you will have to scan using programs such as Paint
 or Windows Fax and Scan with the built in drivers that Microsoft provides.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
If you are not able to scan with these programs after installing the built in drivers, we will need to have you contact Microsoft for further assistance with the built in drivers they provide.</div>

            <p><span>Hope everyone solved this problem, but in case someone still experience issues connecting by network, here‚Äôs the solution:</span></p>
<p><span>Install the all package of drivers for windows 7 (as administrator, and with compatibility mode set to windows 7).</span></p>
<p><span>After the installation, restart, and then go to ‚Äúview scans and cameras‚Äù, and select properties of your MCF-465CN, that should appear there at this time. In the properties, in the tab ‚Äúnetwork settings‚Äù,
 select ‚Äúspecify your machine by address‚Äù, and insert the IP.</span></p>
<p><span>Restart your PC and all should run well, even the ‚Äúcontrol center 3‚Äù</span></p>

            Just came across this and wanted to offer my fix as well. &nbsp;The Windows 10 built in driver works for network printing on the MFC-465CN but not network scanning. &nbsp;To fix this, download the Windows 7 driver suite from Brother and run the install file. &nbsp;Click
 on custom network install, and then uncheck everything except for the network scanning driver. &nbsp;Let the install finish, restart, and network scanning will work.

This is probably the simplest solution, and it worked the first time for me. I'd recommend it. Thanks WaarrEagle.

<p>Ha ha. Yes this solved my problem. Thank you.</p>
<p>I have a Brother MFC 465CN. After upgrading to Windows 10 I eventually realised it would no longer scan. At some point I had removed the Brother ControlCenter 3 application. On the Brother site there are limited utilities that you can download for Windows
 10 for an old MFC printer device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Brother website I indicated that I had windows 7 and then the "Full Driver and Software Package" is available to download. Download the full package and then , as WaarEagle directs, right click on the downloaded file and select properties then go
 to the "compatibility" tab and select Run this program in compatibility mode ...for Windows 7 and Run as Administrator and then close the window and double click to execute the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should then get the Brother ControlCenter application that then allows you to scan again!</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; I've seen a lot of people having this issue right now.&nbsp; Can you please first try power cycling the console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds till it shuts down to see if that helps?&nbsp; If it does not then do a factory reset on the console.&nbsp; There is an option to keep installed games and apps so you won't need to reinstall&nbsp; them but I'd like you to delete Fortnite before doing the reset.&nbsp; Hopefully that will get things up and running for you again.</p>

    <title>WSUS clients not yet reported - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fluxblocker  say:</h3>
<h2>            WSUS clients not yet reported</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed a new WSUS server and there are a few clients reporting but most are not.&nbsp; The new server has a different name, but I updated the GPO to reflect the new server name but the existing clients are not reporting.&nbsp; The old server and the
 new one both are using port 80 and not using SSL. &nbsp;I checked the registry of the old and new clients to make sure the new server name was present in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate (and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
 on the 64-bit machines)&nbsp;and the new server name was there on both the old and new clients, so it looks like&nbsp;the gpo is being processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thing is - I don't think it's the server, because the client PCs I have set up AFTER the new server was installed
 are all working, but the older clients are the onse that aren't reporting.&nbsp; So it has got to be something with the clients, right?&nbsp; The new server is a 64-bit 2008 R2 server and the old one was a 32-bit 2008 server, but the clients don't care about that, do
 they?&nbsp; The new clients that work correctly are all 64-bit, but some of the older clients that are not working are 64-bit and some are 32-bit.&nbsp; All the clients are Windows 7 except for a scant few Vista and XP machines... less than 10 total non-Windows 7 clients.&nbsp;
 So in summary, the WSUS server says the clients have not&nbsp;yet reported on all clients that were installed before the server was changed.&nbsp; If you try to run Windows Update on the clients it fails with an error code of 800B0001.&nbsp; Running wuauclt /detectnow from
 the command prompt does not help either.&nbsp; The following events were found in the application log on one of the problem clients:</p>

<h2>            original and 360 backwards compatible Need For Speed games</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so i know that there are other backwards compatible games coming out soon and thats cool. I was wondering if you guys could make all of the older Need For Speed games backwards compatible, that would be amazing!! (NFS Most Wanted 2005, NFS Most Wanted
 2012, NFS The Run, NFS Undercover, NFS Undergrounds 1&amp;2, NFS Pro Street, NFS Hot Pursuit, NFS Shifts 1&amp;2, NFS Carbon) Keep up the good work!!</p>

            The ability to vote on future back-compat games appears to have been removed from the current
<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Feedback site</a>, but you can always contact EA and ask them to approve it, since they would have to approve it before Microsoft could make them back-compatible.<br />
<br />
Just speculating here, but the problem may be the licensing of the cars. Older games that rely on licensed content are harder to convert because the original game publisher may no longer have the license to that content anymore. For a racing game like NFS,
 Electronic Arts may not have the license to use cars produced by a certain company anymore, and it would be harder to remove those cars.<br />

            Not a big chance this game will be backwards compatible high chance most of the licensing is outdated with the car companies that are in the game but hope they will be bc one day

<p>The NFS games are still available for purchase on both the Playstation's store and the Xbox Marketplace. Even stuff such as Prostreet. Thus, I think that they still are able to make it back-compat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, why was the back-compat requesting feature removed?</p>

            Bombard EA on Twitter. Sadly I don‚Äôt think there will be interest on their end if and when they announce a new game.

    <title>Video not working with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mooser48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Video worked fine with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Now, when I first turn on Skype, the video works briefly (WebCam SC13HD11939N - built into my Samsung Model: NP550P7C-TO5CA) then turns off and Skype says it can't find a camera. I click the "video" button and the camera turns on briefly then turns off and
 the video button disappears.</p>
<p>I've "re-loaded" Windows 10 and run a fix on the system files to no avail.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried some settings in AVG free version but the solution above seems to refer to the total "internet protection" AVG package. I have emails in to AVG (includes your information below) but merely get "circular" suggestions where I end up back where I started
 or that ask questions like "have you turned on the camera".</p>
<p>Perhaps some solution will present itself in the near future as more suggestions "arrive".</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>HDMI Out Audio Issues &#40;Incomplete Surround Sound&#41;&#10; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDMI Out Audio Issues &#40;Incomplete Surround Sound&#41;&#10;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an RCA RT2911 receiver with 5.1 surround speakers (it's dinky, I know, but I live in an apartment so it is sound enough). I have an Xbox 360 and a BD player connected to it via HDMI and I can hear the audio from each of those in proper surround sound.
 When I connect my Xbox One to the same receiver, also by HDMI (it has 3 HDMI inputs), what I hear is the rear channel audio (background noise, essentially) coming from the front left and right speakers only. It is as if the receiver thinks it is getting a
 stereo signal containing only the rear channel audio.</p>
<p>- My Xbox One is set to 5.1 Uncompressed Audio.<br />
- My receiver is set to Dolby Digital Surround.&nbsp;<br />
- I've tried 3 different HDMI cables, all with the same results. <br />
- I have swapped the HDMI cable from my Xbox 360 to my Xbox One - same input in the receiver where the Xbox 360 was sending surround sound - and get the same result.<br />
- This happens to audio from the Xbox One whether streaming through Amazon Prime, watching a DVD, or playing a game.
<br />
- I am not using HDMI input / pass-through on the Xbox.</p>
<p>I can rule out settings / issues on my receiver since it plays surround sound from my other devices. I can rule out settings / issues on my Xbox One because it was properly sending surround audio to my friend's receiver (although I suppose it is possibly
 it got bumped on its way back to my place). All I can think that is left is some sort of incompatibility between the Xbox One and my particular brand of receiver.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know anything about this or have a solution for me? I'd rather only buy a new receiver if I am quite sure that will resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Pretzel! Have you tried setting your Xbox One audio output to something like Bitstream Out to see what happens? I know Uncompressed is the "official" best-quality, but I use bitstream over optical and am quite pleased with the results. I know from reading
 a wide variety of other posts on these forums from time to time that the audio settings can be quite fiddly and sometimes require being set to something you wouldn't EXPECT should be the right thing. I've had people with similar issues with their surround
 audio, but when they change to a different HDMI format (i.e. 7.1 or Bitstream) they suddenly get results.</p>
<p>The nice thing with Bitstream is, since you're only looking for 5.1 sound, that's actually an acceptable bandwidth to carry the 5.1 sound and then let the receiver take care of the decoding, essentially giving you the same output, it's just a different box
 doing the decoding.</p>
<p>If all else fails, does your Surround System have an Optical Input? If so, I would also suggest running HDMI directly to your TV and running from the Xbox One's optical out to the Receiver's Optical (S/PDIF) input and then setting your Optical Sound on the
 Xbox One to Bitstream Out, and then switching between Dolby Digital or DTS for the Bitstream Formats. It sounds crazy, I know, but it might work, given what some others have run into.</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

<h2>            Start-up problem after Windows update abort</h2>
                    I recently had to unplug and shut down my laptop during a Windows update. &nbsp;Now when I go to use my laptop again, it won't start-up successfully. &nbsp;It keeps going to the "Windows Error Recovery" screen and gives me two option: 1) Launch Start-Up Repair and
 2) Start Windows Normally. &nbsp;I have repeatedly tried both options. &nbsp;Launch Start-Up Repair always shows loading files then takes me to a Microsoft-like desktop wallpaper with a large cursor arrow - but now icons or start button then freezes there. &nbsp;#2 Start
 Windows Normally &nbsp;gives me a screen "Starting Windows" with the blinking 4-color flag. It freezes there for a short time then jumps back to the "Windows Error Recovery" screen again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions on how to complete start-up?</div>

<h2>            Kernel Data Inpage Error &#47; Stop&#58; 07a Windows7</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me with this issue.<br />
<br />
I've been having to hardboot my PC because it will stop responding.&nbsp; This usually occurs while I am running a game and viewing streamed movies(legally) at the same time.&nbsp; I try the old "ctrl+alt+delete" to bring up the task manager, but the PC refuses to respond
 forcing me to hardboot.&nbsp; While the PC is not responding I hear a single beep coming from the PC on about a two second interval.&nbsp; The beeps make me think my HDD is dead or dying.&nbsp; Until today I've never gotten a BSOD, here is what it said:<br />
<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Kernel Date Inpage Error</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Stop 0x0000007A (0xFFFFF6FC40009988, 0xFFFFFFFFC0000056, 0x000000006077A860, 0xFFFFF880013311D0)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ntfs.sys address FFFFF880013311D0</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">base at FFFFF8800124000 Datestamp 4d799976</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Physical memory dump failed w/ status 0xC0000010.</span><br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
When I got this BSOD I had to hardboot again.&nbsp; However when the PC restarted it showed a blackscreen with this message:<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
CD-Rom Boot Priority...No Medium.<br />
Reboot and select proper boot device.<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
I inserted a bootdisk I made and started in safemode, from there I restarted the PC w/o issue and am now using it to write this question.<br />
<br />
Am I right in assuming it is my HDD?&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 mail app crashing when i click on an email or try to write a new email</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my system working properly until this morning. then suddenly, after reinstalling an app (Plex player for windows 10) from the App store, the mail app doesn't work any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN particular, it opens ok, but it crashes every time that I click on an email to read it. It also crashes when I try to write a new email. No error messages, just the app closes itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried so far: </p>
<p>
</p><p>-Running the app store troubleshooting tool</p>
<p>-running wsreset</p>
<p>-Uninstalling and reinstalling the app again (through powershell)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far no luck. Any help?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi anti-glare, press and hold the Power Button for 5 -10 seconds to perform a hard shut down, then restart your PC to see if it Starts . . .
<br />
<br />If not, follow these steps to get into the Windows Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What happens when you press Ctrl Alt Del to access the blue screen and Power Icon in bottom right - you can tab or use mouse to get to it, click on it, arrow down to Restart, press Enter.?
<br />
<br />If no way to shut down hold the power button in to force it.  Wait five minutes then power up.  What happens? 
<br />
<br />If it wont start then use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it‚Äôs  hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the ‚ÄúPC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.‚Äù    But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.    After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.
<br />

            Could you try performing a cold boot by powering down the system, wait 10 seconds, start the computer again.
