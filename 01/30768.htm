<h2>            Surface Book with Performance Base Battery</h2>
                    Within the last couple of weeks, the battery on my Surface Book will drain while I am gaming.&nbsp; This did not used to happen until recently.&nbsp; Does this mean that there is something wrong with my battery? I have only had it since May, 2017.<br />

            How MUCH of a drain are you seeing? And over what period of time? Try running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> which can find and fix issues.

            So this is what it said... also, battery 1 drains by about 20% in 20 minutes. Battery 0 by around 5%<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12d18b5f-0dd2-42c0-b2ee-49cccc99be02?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12d18b5f-0dd2-42c0-b2ee-49cccc99be02?upload=true" /></a>

            Looking at
<br />
<br />diagnostic details 
<br />Power Supply &amp; Battery: laptop mode 
<br />Laptop mode not detected. 
<br />Possible causes 
<br />Issues with the power supply 
<br />Can't detect the battery state 
<br />Dust in the power supply connector 
<br />Power supply connector is damaged 
<br />Next steps 
<br />Make sure the power supply light is on when connected. If not, replace the power supply. 
<br />Do a reset: hold down the power button and volume up button together for 30 seconds. Then, connect the power supply again. 
<br />Clean any dust or metallic particles from the power supply connector. 
<br />For Surface Book, detach the display from the base. Connect the power supply to the bottom of the display and charge fully before re-attaching 
<br />
<br />Did you/will you try the suggestions after "Next Steps"?
<br />
<br />If you are in the USA, it would be a very good idea to visit the closest physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> and have them run some tests (and show them the report you ran).

            They will exchange it if needed, so back up any local files/data before you go.

            I ran the diagnostic again and it came back with no problems this time... I'm starting to think the issue is that the charger's power supply isn't powerful enough.

            There has been talk of that with the newer Surface Book 2 but not the original Surface Book. If it were me, I'd visit the Store, do a gaming test with a Microsoft technician watching.

    <title>Mouse or cursor issues after the new Windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse or cursor issues after the new Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday, I have updated to the newest 8.1, and everything seemed perfect. By the way, great update, love the interaction between the two interfaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, after few hours of PC work, possibly after hibernation, the Windows gets a bit "buggy".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can't do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- get the mouse to the right corners for the Charm (I have to press Ctrl+C instead), the mouse just won't do anything</p>
<p>- get the mouse to the upper left corner for the active apps/metro apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- get the mouse to the bottom edge for the taskbar in the metro interface</p>
<p>- get the mouse to the upper edge for the "close/minimize bar" in the opened metro app</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, the mouse "gestures" don't work at all, and I have to restart the computer. Then it works, but just for a short time. Which is kind of annoying, as I am used to hibernate my laptop only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advices? Am I the only one facing this problem? Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kristian</p>

            <p>Hello Kristian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description I understand that after installing Windows Update the mouse is not responding effectively. There can be several reasons for this cause like there might be a driver corruption, third-party application conflict or may be viruses. Let’s
 try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What are the updates have you installed recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check if there is any updates installed regarding mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What are the make &amp; model of the computer and mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the mouse driver.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the&nbsp;mouse driver from device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the Run dialog box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> Window. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In Device Manager, <strong>double click</strong> on the <strong>Mice and other pointing devices.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. It will show you the device driver name, <strong>select that device</strong> and then
<strong>right click on it</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click on <strong>Uninstall</strong> button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>6. After the uninstalling the drivers <strong>restart the computer</strong> and check if it helps</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If there is a <strong>yellow question marks</strong> on any
<strong>USB</strong> [Universal Serial bus], then I would suggest you to <strong>
right click</strong> on it and select <strong>uninstall. </strong>After uninstalling the USB drivers, restart the computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also&nbsp;try to&nbsp;update the mouse driver from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the articles: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Download and install drivers</span></a></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><strong>Boot the computer in safe mode with networking</strong></span></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>and check if the issue
 persists. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a <strong>clean boot</strong> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting’.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues. We will be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply, unfortunately, the problem persists, although, the Method 2 worked - the problem seems gone in the safe mode. It is really tricky to say, as it takes about four hours for the bug to show up, so I had to leave PC in safe mode for
 a whole day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It was the latest Windows 8.1 update, which brings taskbar in the Start Screen, also the Power options and the ability to pin "Metro style apps" to the taskbar. Before this update everything was just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;No, there is no update regarding mouse. Also none was installed for a very long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I'm running a ultrabook HP Envy 6 1030ec with a Windows 8.1. Model of the mouse is wireless Gigabyte ECO-600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I really don't think it is the mouse issue, as the "hot corners" don't work on the touch-pad either.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same issue <strong>ONLY</strong>&nbsp;when i'm&nbsp;using google chrome as a browser.
</p>
<p>I started using Chrome again some days ago because they fixed some things and I noticed the problem the same day, but I couldn't imagine that this was the issue. I mean, this has never happened before. Since I changed back to firefox, problem gone. If you
 are using chrome as your main browser, try using another for some time to see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's a little bit of strange, that a browser can cause such problems, but I think maybe there is a conflict between latest version of&nbsp;chrome (or some of it's functions) and the operating system.

</p><p>You should be forwarding this issue to Microsoft engineers because many people are dealing with it. This isn't something that TinoArts should have to fix.

 new one was also rejected. So I'm totally locked out. I'm running Windows on a Parallels virtual machine on a Mac. Help! I'm very grateful for any advice (I emailed Microsoft for advice and was just told to post here). &nbsp;&nbsp;

            HI LIS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all: 
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1903 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The update went ok, the problem started after the July updates.</p>
<p>I got no errors it just will not clear out the Windows update cleanup files.</p>
<p>It cleared the files out right after I did the 1903 update, but not the July update&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to 1809 and will try it again in a few months&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Follow Up - No Responses Since Original Question was Asked More Than 10 Days Ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 using the Windows Update method.&nbsp; The installation failed due to a&nbsp;Norton Internet Security file that I had to remove.&nbsp; I reinstalled Norton Internet Security and am now running Windows 10 successfully.&nbsp; One problem,
 I can't open Windows Store (it flashes but won't open) and several live tiles on the Start Screen are greyed out (Photos, Weather, News, Money and Phone Companion).&nbsp; I've tried all of the suggestions in this forum such as clearing the Store cache and using
 PowerShell to register the apps.&nbsp; When I try to run wsreset.exe as an Admin, I get a message that the application can't be found.&nbsp; Any other ideas?</p>

<h2>            What about left handed mouse users&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Seriously MS. Why&nbsp;does it take&nbsp;eleventyfive steps to change a mouse from right to left handed?<br />
And where have you hidden the left handed pointers?<br />
<br />
I know I'm not the only lefty out there so why haven't you worked out a really simple step in the PC setup/Windows OS update process where we chose which hand we use and the mouse buttons AND&nbsp; pointers are changed accordingly?<br />
<br />
Its not bloody rocket science!<br />
<br />
PS: <strong>I still haven't found where you've hidden the pointers so if someone could tell me where they are these days I would really appreciate the link</strong>....or just send them to me on a 5.25" floppy<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Mouse <br />
<br />
And if using a mouse that has its own drivers there is probably a program in All Programs that allows setting, pointers, and so on.<br />

<p>Hi, I think this might work for you. Type in your search bar "Mouse and touchpad settings". Click on that to open the window. Then scroll down and click on the link "Additional mouse options. The first thing you'll see is button configuration. Put a checkmark
 by that to switch primary and secondary buttons. That should make it where the right side is set for the primary functions.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. This works to change the buttons but it doesn't change the pointers. I still have an arrow pointing bottom right to top left (ie: the opposite way I would hold a pen in my left hand for example). Anyway, I have an older PC that I
 have changed the pointers over and even tried copying those pointer files over to this PC and installing in basically the same way as I did with the other PC but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The files I originally downloaded from MS are no longer there and there is no other option in anything I can find from MS that helps me change the pointers/cursors from right to left handed

            <p>I see what you're talking about now. I went over to the Pointers tab and the Pointer Options tab and there is no option for the arrow pointing bottom left to top right. I would have thought, too, that since there are options to change the button position
 that there would also be an option to change the arrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know exactly what you mean. I'm left-handed also. I write with my left hand, use a fork with my left hand,&nbsp;but when it comes to a mouse, it feels more natural to use a right-handed mouse. I also use a calculator (10-key) with my right hand because it feels
 more natural. I guess I'm what's called ambidextrous because I use my right hand for a lot of different things, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just automatically assumed there would be options to change a mouse for people that were left-handed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes with this problem. I would have thought Microsoft would include options for the mouse for left-handed people. Go figure!</p>

<p>Quick Access is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what solved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A)</p>
<p>My IT guy started the Win10 Pro 64 bit version 1709 install from the Windows 10 Update assistant:&nbsp; I had tried it earlier thru the regular Windows update function but I kept getting error 0x80242006.&nbsp; The Win10 Update Asst ran the update without the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>This took a long time and my screen turned black.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>B)</p>
<p>I then plugged one of my monitors into the HDMI port on my motherboard, bypassing the graphics card.&nbsp; Then I could see that the 1709 update had installed properly but it had left my graphics card temporarily dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C)</p>
<p>Then I ran the regular windows updates for the additional updates to 1709 and restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D)</p>
<p>Then I ran the update for my GeForce video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E)</p>
<p>Then I plugged my monitor back in to the graphics card like it was originally and restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F)<br />
Next I cleared the automatic destination and custom destination folders (but I did it one file at a time using the delete button).&nbsp; Previously I had tried to delete them all in one motion with Select All.&nbsp; Then I restarted the last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One or all of these steps restored the quick access functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone for their help.</p>

 Now it just doesn't work. Phone says I'm connected and I can see data flows in Task Manager on Wi-Fi Direct adapter&nbsp;when I do something on phone but Connect app on Surface Pro 4 still saying "Lumia 640 is&nbsp;about to project" but it always fails. Is there any

<p>Thank you. It didn't help. I did a reset with 'keep personal files'. Now Miracast works. Need to reinstall all my programs...</p>

<h3> marksutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Profile keeps corrupting. </h2>
                    
<p>Right I usually keep my profile on my HDD and never have any problems with my profile corrupting, then I transfer my profile to a Memory Unit or USB drive and take it to a friends and use my profile on their 360 and play a few games on there, when I return
 I put the memory unit/USB drive in my 360 to transfer it back and its corrupted and yet when if I were to put it back in my friends 360 my profile isn't corrupted???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I can recover my profile but believe me having to recover a big profile like mine takes a good 2 - 3 hours and it gets very annoying having to do that every single time!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have XBL changed something as I never had this problem in the past?</p>

<p>Forgive the question but have these friends of yours been up to something naughty with their Xbox 360s?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a console is banned or flagged to be banned, it corrupts any data that is written on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you plug your profile into one of these consoles, gain an achievement for example, and then try to use it in your clean console then BAM...it'll show as corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is to stop people moving their profile back and forth between a banned and unbanned console.</p>

<p>OK, so read your posts. I will throw a twist in it. I have had my Xbox for about 6 months and had to reformat my USB drive the same number of times if not more. I never change consoles. It just stops working and needs to be reformated. Just this week I transferred
 &nbsp;downloaded games and game info onto the USB drive and bam today it does not work. I did not even remove it from the console. HELP!!!!</p>
<p>I was trying to navigate their awful support website and saw forums. I hope someone can give a solution. Thanks</p>

<p>Hey there Broom! What brand/model/size USB device are you using? Have you tried using a different one? If not, try formatting the USB device to FAT32 on your computer before formatting it again on the console. Let me know what works, thanks!

<h2>            HDMI no sound, shows DVI in settings.</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen a few issues like this one but none of the help or fixes seem to have worked.</p>
<p>I was at a friends house using a hd tv there with the HDMI cable i use and i noticed the 4 red rings flash up then back off.</p>
<p>Since then when i have HDMI cables connected to any TV i get no sound and in&nbsp; the settings i have a bunch of resolutions to choose and it shows DVI.</p>
<p>If i disable the Display Discovery setting it will reset the xbox back to 480p with HDMI shown in the settings, so i know the HDMI cable is fine, it works ok on my PS3 and vice versa. I can reselct the 1080p option and all is good again.</p>
<p>But when i go back to my friends house or change TV at mine i have to go through about a 20 min trial and error period to just get my display working again with sound output. I only got this xbox in may, so it should still have warranty?</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me,</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hey there Drake! If you are concerned that the brief red lights are an issue, and you just got the console in May, you can still get an in-warranty repair. You can get info on this and start one up on our "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to get your Xbox product repaired</a>" page. Let us know how that goes, thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. I was talking with the awesome people at the Xbox Support Twitter page who helped me out. It looks like the HDMI port has a fault so will be sending it for repairs.</p>
<p>The problem was getting worse, even though its been about 2 weeks or so, sound issues are popping up.</p>
<p>While playing games the sound would crackle.</p>
<p>Probably a good thing to send it now before christmas.</p>
<p>Getting married on wednesday, so could do without the distractions hehe</p>

    <title>Schedule Windows Update download - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Schedule Windows Update download</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 8.1, I have automatic updates set to run during maintenance at 3:00 am. Allow maintenance to wake computer is checked. My last 2 update sessions were installed at 1:10 am and 2:46 pm today. I only have 5 GB data allowance on satellite. I now have
 less than .5 GB left for the next 3 1/2 weeks. I have a bonus 5 GB between 2 am and 8 am which is when I'm trying to get my updates downloaded. The 8.1 update downloaded automatically during the day (I was saving that for my bonus time - I thought I had to
 select&nbsp;Download on the webpage)&nbsp;and ate a huge chunk of my allowance. I am not a vampire. I am not up between 2 am and at least 7 am. I don't want to have to get up and rush out to turn on my laptop, get to updates and have it check for updates. Bring back
 the ability to schedule downloads, please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Task Scheduler, but I have no idea what Windows Update executable file name is or where it is and I don't have time to search my whole hard drive for it. I don't even have time to type this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm going to have to select check for updates but let me decide when to download and install, set my alarm earlier than I want and do computer updates before I have my breakfast. And I will be grumbling about Microsoft while I do it.

<p>This seems to combine a few games together - GTA + Mass effect + Warcraft.......................I have not heard of this game before but from watching the vids this game looks and sounds as if they intend to take gaming to the next level - with the mass
 of players , the size of the open world etc....................Will be keeping an eye out for this one</p>

<p>Needed to bump this thread due to the fact that this game has been confirmed today for PC, 360 and ps3 release on April 2nd 2013.</p>
<p>Even bigger news is that it doesn't require a subscription which can only be good.</p>
<p>I've been playing the beta on the PC this weekend and had an absolute blast with it.&nbsp; Looking forward to it and the TV series.</p>

            <p>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system.
<br />
Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through this process.</p>

<h2>            My computer crashes with a blue screen error</h2>
                    <p>I built my computer last year it's a good computer with good parts but the Windows 8 code I got from a friend and I never activated Windows, now out of nowhere my computer crashes after 2 minutes of run time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SHORTENED---</p>
<p>Could my computer crash from not having a working/activated Windows 8 key</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could these crashes be happening from a unplugged wire in my hardware&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any drivers I can install to fix these crashes&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used malware bytes to scan my computer before the crashes started happening and they detected files that were dangerous so I removed them could that be why I'm having these problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I remove my hard drive get a new one and get a new operating system (Windows 8 key/code) will these crashes stop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A while ago I accidentally removed Microsoft visual ++ but I went to the website and downloaded them again could this be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I launched chrome in Windows 8 mode could this have caused the crashes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and help</p>
<p>
</p><p>From another post:</p>
<p>How much money do I have to pay for someone to come to my house in CA and fix my blue screen crashing problems

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes, You should have a genuine Windows running on the computer and should be activated. This can be one of the reasons.</span></p>

<p>I've a problem with my windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>When I work with my device I can sense that my registry has been modified!</p>
<p>For example when I right click for view the " Send to " menu, it's open FAST! but I know the waiting time is 400 ms in default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And some modified keys that I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I refresh or reset my system using " Refresh your PC " at settings, Will Registry effect?</p>
<p>I DON'T WANT LOSE MY INSTALLED PROGRAMS!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I included&nbsp;Refresh and Reset, but the are just the ongoing steps IF it was necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you say, don't do them if you want to keep installed Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you read this Microsoft information about&nbsp;repairing corrupt system files and errors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files"</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>

<br />
Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<br />
If you already had the most current driver/the speed didn’t increase:</div>
<div><br />
a. Click the Start-&gt; Right click <strong>Computer</strong><br />
<div>b. Click Manage-&gt; Click <strong>Device Manager</strong><br />
<div>c. Expand <strong>IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>d. Right click your <strong>FireWire </strong>host controller.<br />
<div>e. Click <strong>Update </strong>Driver Software.<br />
<div>f. Click <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong><br />
<div>g. Click <strong>Let me pick </strong>from a list of device drivers on my computer<br />
<div>h. Click <strong>1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy)<br />
</strong></div>
<div>i. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, you have duplicate files (word, music etc) and wanted to delete these duplicate files. To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue,
 I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How exactly these duplicate files got created?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you able to access these duplicate files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be a possibility that your computer is been infected from virus or malware. However, I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety
 Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
 It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</b></a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions,
 download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on
 that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with more information on the issue so that we can assist you in better way and for any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we
 will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>If you have many files the easiest way to do this is to use a duplicate file/folder finder utility to find and delete the duplicates, There are only a handful of good utilities that will find duplicate folders and none are free, there are a bit more duplicate
 file finders available, some of them freeware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find duplicate files only I like Duplicate File Finder by Rashid Hoda, I think that it is one of the best one out there.&nbsp; It's a small utility and it is very fast!&nbsp; It's old and discontinued but it works on Windows 7 and I have yet to find a better freeware
 duplicate file finder, I prefer the older 1.0.2.8 version but it is difficult to find on the web nowadays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1.1.0.3 is the newest (last) version, available here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeware-guide.com/dir/util/cleanup/DuplicateFileFinder.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freeware-guide.com/dir/util/cleanup/DuplicateFileFinder.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Things are not so easy when it comes to finding good duplicate folder finder utilities, I've yet to find any good free ones and so far I've only found 3 decent commercial ones that I can recommend.&nbsp; As well as being able to find duplicate folders these utilities
 can also find duplicate files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/duplicatecleaner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Duplicate Cleaner Pro by Digital Volcano Software</a> - it works well and has an easy to use modern interface.&nbsp; Note that only the Pro version of the software
 will find duplicate folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.file-utilities.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Directory Report by AMB Software</a> - Don't let the old ancient looking interface fool you, this is one powerful completely up to date enterprise class utility!&nbsp; It's a bit more difficult
 to use and get the hang of than my other recommendation but it is faster and can work on hundreds of thousands of files across networks, I settled on Directory Report rather than Duplicate Cleaner Pro but by all means Duplicate Cleaner Pro is also nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, <a href="http://www.foldermatch.com/fminfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Folder Match by Salty Brine Software</a> is another powerful enterprise class software package that can greatly help you get a handle on your duplicates and folder structure backup problems, it will help you synchronize and do some cleaning in your folder structures.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have an ASUS laptop computer with Windows and not "BY" Windows and Microsoft.<br />
<br />
The backlight function, if the laptop has it, is an ASUS feature. Should be easy enough<br />
to check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation, and their forums for info<br />
concerning any backlight functions.<br />
