<h2>            Windows 10</h2>
                    For the last 2 weeks I have been trying to install the OEM software for my&nbsp; new Brother&nbsp; multi printer but it will not install and neither could the Brother Tech . Now I can't connect to the internet using PUREVPN either, the PUREVPN Tech suggested I should
 re- install windows&nbsp; after he failed to get the VPN working as well. Is there another way to fix this without&nbsp; having to re install all my software again. P.s. the are very few computer techs in Thailand that can speak even basic English. your help is appreciated.

            Hi Arthur.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for quick reply It is most appreciated but as the software did not install at all there is nothing to uninstall.</p>
<p>The printer is a brand new Brother DCP-T310 I tried installing the software using both the OEM disc that came with the printer and also by downloaded the software files from the brother website, when that didn't work either, I contacted Brother support and
 their Tech tried to do several&nbsp; remote download and installations, she eventually gave up and managed to install a generic driver pack just to get it working. Without any of the additional software features.
</p>
<p>My main problem is not being able to use my VPN anymore as&nbsp; it suddenly stopped working and would not connect to the internet after much frustration uninstalling/re-installing of PUREVPN software I gave up and contacted a purevpn support Tech he gave a few
 suggestions which did nothing. Tried contacting purevpn again and the Purevpn Tech tried to do a remote repair, without&nbsp; success, his superior then looked into the problem and suggested re-installing windows as the best option. what is your view?</p>
<p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, &nbsp; Arthur</p>

            Arthur, I'd still go through the steps because there may be other printer drivers that are blocking the install.  You want to clean them all out, not just the Brother driver that I realize you can't get installed.  
<br />
<br />You may not even know if WIndows Update installed the wrong printer driver in background that is conflicting.  This is why the steps are crucial to unblocking printer driver install and work when nothing else will.  
<br />
<br />As long as it is a Windows 10 compatible driver, then there is no other explanation for why it won't install unless you install is heavily corrupted.  Do you have other performance problems?

<h2>            Win 10 1607 - Unable to Install Update KB4091461 - Error 0x800f0922</h2>
                    <p>For over a month now (mid April 2018), I have been unable to install the Win 10 update&nbsp;KB4091461 on my daughter's PC. All other updates are downloaded and installed regularly. The PC tries daily to install it, but constantly fails,&nbsp;with error 0x800f0922.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited for the May 2018 cumulative update to be installed, hoping it would make this particularly nasty update superseded, but after installing the cumulative update, the&nbsp;KB4091461 popped up again.<br />
</p>
<p>I have researched this particular error and it appears it boils down to a handful of causes:<br />
- a low system reserved partition<br />
- a communication issue with the server<br />
- a .Net Framework issue<br />
</p>
<p>I tried to address each issue, with the specific solutions available, but I failed to solve the problem. In fact - as mentioned above - only this particular update fails to install: all other updates are installed flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC in question is an Acer W510, powered by an Atom Z2760 and has 2 GB of Ram. The OS is Win 10 Professional, version 1607, build 14393.2248.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this update is critical, but this little issue bothers me, as it leads me to think that my PC may have other problems.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft community
<br />
<br />In this case, due to the incident that you present with the download and installation of the update, I consider it possible that it is caused by residual files of a previously executed update process. Because of this, I suggest you verify that your computer has a correct date and time, and delete the contents of the directory: C: \ windows \ SoftwareDistribution \ Download.
<br />
<br />In addition to this, it will be useful to run the automatic file for Fix Windows Update issues, and wait for the system to perform the search for updates
<br />
<br />Fix Windows Update issues

<br />
<br />Any other additional thing, you can create a new question.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />Hope this can help you

<p>Hi Yohandi,</p>
<p>thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Though I had already tried this solution, I tried it once again.</p>
<p>Emptied the download folder in c<span>:\windows\SoftwareDistribution, downloaded and run the windows 10 update troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>The troubleshooter reports to have fixed the issues, but the update page reported once more&nbsp;<span>error 0x800f0922 on the same update.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype causing problems Windows and application shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I use Skype quite often, everyday basically. For about a week now I've had the problem that at completely random times my computer shuts down, no warning, no nothing, just shuts down. It doesn't restart automatically and it doesn't say that there was
 even an error, it just immediately shuts down. I don't think my computer is getting too hot. But this is only when Skype is running, sometimes it can be fine for hours.<br />
<br />
Also, when using Skype my screen won't turn off automatically, so I assigned the screen off put to 'F4', this works, but sometimes after I close the screen, the Skype application closes, again no warning or errors, the whole window just disappears and I need
 to restart the application.<br />
<br />
What could be going on?<br />
<br />

<p>Intel Core i5-5200U<br />

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing you.

<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down

<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\

<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old

    <title>Problem with Halo Reach controller. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flamippo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Halo Reach controller.</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recently bought this controller online </span>and my right trigger doesn't feel as smooth as the left or the triggers on my other controllers. It feels like it's catching or scraping against something. There's nothing technically
 wrong with the controller, but the trigger thing annoys me. I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix it? I guess I'd have to take the controller apart but it's brand new and I'm afraid I'll do something wrong. My experience with taking things apart with screws
 and putting them back together ended up with the thing not feeling normal. I could practice on my other controller, which isn't as good. Any suggestions about the problem other than taking it apart?</p>

<p>I had a problem with mine where you'd try to "look left" somewhere and it'd feel like the sensitivity is super low and to fix it I'd just look right and left again and it'd be alright for a while. Though big problem in shoots where you need to turn fast.
 But cos I bought the console I just switched to the other Reach controller and have been alright since.</p>

            Hi DavidAerne
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Start concerned app which you want to make default &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open task manager &gt; Right click on this app (you may require to expand it and click on an entry) &gt; Properties &gt; Note down .exe file name
<br />
<br />Right click &gt; Open File Location &gt; Now, you have the location where this app's program location is
<br />
<br />Right click on the concerned DAT file in File explorer &gt; Open with &gt; Choose another app &gt; More apps &gt; Look for another app on this PC &gt; Now go to that location which you picked up above and choose the exe file which you picked up above &gt; You can also choose Use this app always to open.... 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            You wrote - im trying to change the dat files back to to default so they work properly
<br />
<br />That is why I am asking what was the previous default. Generally dat files are associated with text editors such as Notepad.

            You will need to break the association. 
<br />
<br />1. Open Notepad &gt; File &gt; Save As &gt; Put a name in File Name: box with extension .exe (example - temp.exe) and change Save As type: to all files and OK
<br />
<br />2. Now right click on the file whose association do you want to change or remove &gt; Open with &gt; More apps &gt; Look for another app on this PC &gt; Choose the .exe file of step 1 &gt; OK
<br />Now delete the .exe file of step 1.
<br />This will cause the association to be broken.
<br />Reboot

            After reading your original post again and you posting this does not resolve your issue.  If I gather correctly, you are not seeking to have the Start pop up to NOT come up on the primary screen.  Unfortunately, the way Windows is designed, the pop up will always be in the same screen the START button is located (your primary screen) and the pop will always be on the primary screen.
<br />
<br />I know we didn't resolve your issue on getting the screen working the way you wanted, but I hope I have answered your question.  If you have no further questions, please close this thread by choosing a rating.  Have a great day! 
<br />
<br />If you have any additional questions keep the thread open, feel to ask.

<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">I have a problem with wlan autoconfig service. If this service is enabled, then during start up computer just goes through infinite cycles of windows opening and then blue screen appearing saying windows
 was not shut down properly (screenshot attached). This stops when I finally select safe mode.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">On the other hand, if I disable wlan autoconfig service everything works normal except, of course, the internet. I believe this is a result of some infected software that I managed to remove but I cannot
 run malware as I cannot connect internet. Also this infected software (that was supposed to be antivirus software) removed my original antivirus so I am helpless.</span><br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Message: </p>
<p><strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This Stop message indicates that a kernel-mode process or driver attempted to access a memory address to which it did not have permission to access. The most common cause of this error is an incorrect or corrupted pointer that references an incorrect location
 in memory. A pointer is a variable used by a program to refer to a block of memory. If the variable has an incorrect value in it, the program tries to access memory that it should not. When this occurs in a user-mode application, it generates an access violation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the link below and download the hotfix to fix the issue.</p>

<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>i bought a xbox media remote&nbsp; so i can use a remote with the bonus of xbox 360 support.</p>
<p>my old remote broke and im having trouble tuning the remote to my dmtech tv.</p>
<p>i managed to get it to search and tune but all i can do is change volume, turn on and off the tv and bring up the input menu.</p>

<p>my xbox is connected via component so i want to bring up the input menu and select it.</p>

<p>you have to press input to get it.</p>

<p>Hey there, so you got the media remote to synch up to the TV, but it will only control the power and volume? &nbsp;Does it do nothing when you try to bring up the input menu? &nbsp;One thing to check is to see if the TV needs a firmware update. &nbsp;Is it a smart TV?</p>

<h2>            BLUE SCREEN WITH EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a new base unit which has windows 7 loaded, i installed my old maxtor basics 500g external hard drive from my xp pc,&nbsp;the hard drive shows up in my computer but&nbsp;when i try to access some files on it i get a blue screen and pc shuts down.</p>
<p>I have just noticed that the drive is now showing as an NTFS in the hard drive section of device manager whereas it used to be under universal USB in xp!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this just a driver issue or is maxtor not compatible with windows 7?</p>
