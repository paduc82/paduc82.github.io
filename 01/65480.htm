            <p>Do you have another keyboard, say a USB connected one, to try? If it happens only when you try to type, just wondering if the keyboard is faulty and its somehow operating the windows key?</p>

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/216893</a> if you can click the disable/enable bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its not that, then possible malware maybe? Can you get as far as updating your anti-virus program and then run a full scan to see if it finds any problems? When you say 'not able to do so' whats happening?</p>

            Hi <span>Peggy A.</span>, <br />
<br />
Please check first if an e-mail is stuck in the Outbox folder of Windows Live Mail before you look into your account settings.
<br />
<br />
The Outbox folder is located below your account folders on the left pane. Delete all of its contents before synchronizing or sending a new e-mail.
<br />
<br />
Also, make sure&nbsp;that you're using the latest version of Windows Live Mail by clicking on this
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
If they are all setup, please confirm with your e-mail service provider if you have the correct information for these:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Check with them if you are using the correct SMTP port settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Verify if your e-mail authentication is supported.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Confirm with your ISP/ESP if they are blocking Port 25.&nbsp; If they are, I would suggest using port 587&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of port 25&nbsp;to help you get around any blocks set-up on this port.<br />
<br />
Add&nbsp;Windows Live Mail program to the safe list of the appropriate Internet filtering software; if you're using a firewall, pop-up blocking or anti-virus software.&nbsp; For instructions, contact the manufacturer of the anti-virus or firewall software that is installed
 on your computer. <br />
<br />
If it still persists, let us know the complete error message you're getting.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks!<br />

            I too have just started experiencing this issue, the error message I get is as follows:<br />
<br />
Server Error: 421<br />
Server Response : 421 Cannot establish SSL withm SMTP server<br />
SSL_connect error 10054<br />
Server: 'stmp.networld.com'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0800CCC67<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25<br />
Serure(SSL): No<br />
<br />
I've changed the port from 25 to 587 as recommended, but the same error as above results with just the port number no being 587.<br />
<br />
Could it be coincidence that there have been some 'cosmetic' changes to Virgin Media Mail's front page?

            Spoken to Virgin Media this morning, they are aware there is an issue and suggested a couple of workarounds - amending the STMP from. ntlworld.com to virginmedia.com, and changing the default prt settings from 25 and 110 to 465 and 995. Unfortunatley no
 joy I'm afraid. They suggested that a fix was planned to be in place by 30/01/2012. So having to use virgin media mail till then.

            just to undate on this issue, all emails seem to be coming and going correctly. Hats off to Virgin Media.<br />
Perhaps contacting your ISP should be the first point of call if users have this problem develop out of the blue.<br />
Suggest moderators put it as a sticky<br />

            Hi <span>HebrideanLamb</span>,<br />
<br />
Check first if an e-mail is stucked in the <strong>Outbox</strong> folder before you look into your account settings. The
<strong>Outbox</strong> folder is located below your account folders on the left pane. Delete all of its contents before synchronizing or sending a new e-mail.
<br />
<br />
It is also possible that you have incorrect POP settings, usually the SSL option for SMTP.
<br />
<br />
You need to confirm with your e-mail service provider if you have the correct information for these:
<br />
<br />
- Check with them if you are using the correct SMTP port settings.&nbsp; <br />
- Verify if your e-mail authentication is supported.<br />

            @HebrideanLamb<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, the hebrides.net SMTP servers only use port 25 and don't use SSL, so it's difficult to understand why you have those settings.
<br />
<br />
Your problem is not the same as the original poster's. Please change your settings back to the defaults, then close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes before relaunching and sending a test message. Then post the new error message here.<br />
<br />
I assume that you are connecting to the Internet via hebrides.net&nbsp;when you&nbsp;are trying to send messages using smtp.hebrides.net. If not,&nbsp;you may not be able to do so.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Update Fail after moving to SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tr4zodone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Fail after moving to SSD</h2>
                    <p>I have a 1.5TB HDD which used to be where my OS was installed, but it was way too slow. I bought a Kingston 120gb SSD and installed Windows on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created two partitions: one with 80gb for Windows 10, and another one with the remaining space for an Ubuntu distribution. I used to have both in the HDD, and it worked fine. I didn't migrate them, I actually fresh-installed both, but pulled some files
 from the HDD, and formated it to use as plain storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first had a problem with Windows due to the fact that I installed Windows 10 S, and it didn't let me install any applications other than those from the store, even after I switched it to Pro and made the necessary changes to the system, even turning off
 windows defender. The issue was that it kept saying that windows defender didn't let me install that application for security reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, I formated the partition again, and installed Windows 10 Pro, and eveything went fine... Until yesterday night. For some reason Windows got stuck on an update, and every time when I set it to turn off or reboot, it stands there for a little while,
 saying that Windows is make the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it reboots, and it says something along the lines of: "installing updates: 86%". When it reaches 100%, it says: "It was not possible to install updates. Undoing changes", and then it reboots. When it boots again, it goes directly to saying that it is
 installing updates, not showing percentages, and then says it failed, and that it is undoing changes. Then the log in screen pops, and I have to input my pin password twice, because the first time is for some reason blatantly ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides that, all is well. The computer is fast as I could want it to be, but the issue is that it takes too much time to both turn on, turn off and reboot, and that was the main reason for me buying an SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through several tutorials. Deleted the Software Distribution folder, ran commands on the cmd.exe (including chkdisk and some others which I don't remember). I am now creating a Flash Drive Win10 installation media, and will try out the recovery
 tool, but I read online that it doesn't quite work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried using the Fall Creators' Update to proceed with the updates, but it didn't recognize any necessary updates. What do?</p>

    <title>Clean installed wrong version of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clean installed wrong version of Windows 10</h2>
                    After I upgraded my pc from windows 7 to windows 10, I decided to do a clean install. The version after the upgrade was Pro 32 bit, but I accidentally installed Home 32 bit that I downloaded with the media creation tool. Obviously I can't activate windows
 now and it is not the right version, so that leaves me in a bit of a pickle. If I format the pc and clean install the right version, will I be able activate it or do I have to reinstall windows 7 and do the upgrade process again?

<h2>            Locked on the wrong country for billing.</h2>
                    
<p>I can't download any free or paid for games due to my details saying I'm in the United States. I live in the United Kingdom and although I can enter my address details, I cannot change the country from US to UK. Hence I can't complete any checkouts.</p>
<p>I've look all through the Xbox live account management and can't find anywhere to change the country. My Windows Live ID shows my address to be the UK, but not on Xbox live.</p>
<p>Any idea how to change the country so I can actually download and play the games?</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

    <title>Transferring Money from PayPal to Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transferring Money from PayPal to Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a $15 Xbox Live points card so i could purchase the "Rezurrection" zombie pack. I entered the code and clicked purchase not realizing that there was tax. I logged in with my PayPal account to add $2 more to my Microsoft account and realized
 that you can only pay for the whole game with one or the other i cannot pay with $15 Microsoft points and $2 PayPal. I started looking for a way to add PayPal money to my Xbox Live account and here i am now.</p>
<p>I can't add it online because my account is in a recovery mode for about 29 more days. If there is anyway to add it online I'd be nice if you could share it with me</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello cooldood9575,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to transfer PayPal money to Microsoft Account currency.</p>
<p>You would either have to use the Microsoft Account money, or your PayPal money.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>

<p>Or get Support from Apple for their Software:</p>

    <title>Cant get microphone to work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike picks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant get microphone to work</h2>
                    As the title says, my computer does not recognize when i plug a microphone in. I am using a pair of headphones with a microphone attached to it. I have tried 2 different sets so i know the actual mic works.
<br />
<br />
Under control panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Manage Audio Devices, Recording tab, it says "no audio devices are installed" I have tried using 2 different ports and it still doesnt work.<br />
<br />
I am running windows 7 Home ultimate. Can anyone shed some light on what i can do?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I recently installed to windows 7 from vista, could it be that some sort of audio driver didnt get installed or xfered over correctly? How would i figure this out?

<div>Hi Mike Picks,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Are you able to hear sound from speakers?<br />

<div><br />
Steps to set services to automatic:<br />
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Click on start button, type services.msc and press Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;Scroll down to one of the service, right click on it and select Properties<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on General tab, select Automatic for startup type.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click on Dependences tab and make sure that all the dependences services are set to Automatic. Then click on OK button.<br />
<div><br />
I would also suggest you to update the sound card drivers</div>
<div>and check.<br />
<div><br />
Steps to update sound card driver:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on start button. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type devmgmt.msc and then press enter.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the sound card device and right click on it<br />

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the properties window, under Driver tab, click on Update Driver button.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the installing the updates restart the computer.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
You haven't accidentally started loading an older save have you? One that's progress is far behind your most recent save?.. &nbsp; I don't personally own the game, but it if allows manual saving, I would select load from the game menu and load an older one to see
 where its at in game progress. If it does not support manual saving/loading &nbsp;and only uses an auto save feature, it's possible that the game was started over and the auto save is now based on a new game progress.</p>
<p><br />
A save wont just disappear unless A) It was deleted B) It was corrupt and the game cant load it. &nbsp;C) Auto save was written over by new game. &nbsp;I would also ask to make sure that you didn't start saving to a USB or cloud storage as then you will have to tell
 it to save to that new location as well as load from it.</p>
<p><br />
Anyways, let us know, I know it will suck if you cant get the save back, though from what I have heard is the game is fairly short and hopefully not too much trouble to redo your progress again.</p>

<p>Bu11etmagn3tt Hey there!</p>
<p>This is actually a known issue with the game at the moment. (Only effecting the 360 version). Sega have informed gamers NOT to install the game to hard drive, and to play it from the disk until they (or Gearbox) come back with a formal announcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice would be to monitor the <a href="http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/forumdisplay.php?f=182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Gearbox forums technical support</a> for that game. As you will see from that link, you are by no means 'alone' in this problem and that many others are suffering from problems exactly the same as yourself. Suffice to say that they will patch this as soon as
 they find a fix for the bug. That is pretty much all that can be done. Keep an eye on the feedback from the tech team over on those forums (whom may of responded to other users threads, so be sure to read the threads too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and that your problem is resolved shortly.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Cloud</p>

<h2>            Windows update successfully installs KB2802618 repeatedly</h2>
                    Windows Update continually installs KB2802618.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have downloaded the update manually and run it - several times - and each time it says it was successful; it then does not appear in updates.</div>
<div>I have run the Windows Update troubleshooter, and after asking for Admin permissions, the troubleshooter "Fixed" issues.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Still no joy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Issues</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>DISM /cleanup-image returns that the option is unknown</li><li>The Installed Updates list is empty</li><li>(therefore) it is not possible to uninstall and re-install updates</li></ul>
</div>
<div>Solutions attempted:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>wsreset</li><li>Windows UPdate Troubleshooter and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Cleanup Tool</a></li><li>Rename of cabroot2 and SoftwareDistribution [<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_update/install-the-package-kb2607607-error/1c399cea-8979-4681-a8df-2c6b6b64b87d">post</a>]</li><li>Confirmed user group similar memberships between Windows 8 devices (one working, one not)</li><li>Using Powershell for /cleanup-image [post]</li><li>Checking registry entry permissions between Windows 8 devices</li><li>Working one-by-one through the Updates to see if I can see a pattern, or supply a list at least</li></ul>
<div>CONCLUSION</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Manual repair was NOT successful. &nbsp;After exhausting MANY MANY routes, including one-by-one installs, found to be down to the Software Protection Service not wanting to start - at all. &nbsp;This was NOT fixed by a "Refresh" within Windows 8, nor was it fixed
 by off-line SFC or by DISM /cleanup (when I eventually got it to work).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Solution was to burn a Windows 8 DVD, run Setup, and then run an installation and remove ALL applications, leaving only User Data (second option).<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>After this, all updates installed correctly, and no software I have installed subsequently has brought the problem back.</div>
</div>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran your suggestions which like the others produced no real results. I ran WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab and produced some info. But it also was able to fully reset my update store and act like I had never downloaded updates list (my update history was
 fine). When I reran my updates,<u> I found that KB2802618 errors the FIRST time only with error: 80070002. After that, each time it attempts to install, it comes back a success</u>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are outputs of my logs (in new replies due to character limit). Please let me know what else you need to help us with this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally solved it by&nbsp;installing this Intel Rapid Storage Driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/xps-8500?driverId=HH2P4&amp;osCode=W764&amp;fileId=3156029474&amp;languageCode=en&amp;categoryId=SA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/xps-8500?driverId=HH2P4&amp;osCode=W764&amp;fileId=3156029474&amp;languageCode=en&amp;categoryId=SA</font></a></p>
<p>It says it includes support for 7 Series SATA AHCI Controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It installed fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then tried&nbsp;Windows Update again said the update was required. Tried it and this time it worked!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Failing Update 2: KB2802618</strong> </p>
<p>Updates say they succeed, but update still required.</p>
<p>I note on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2802618?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2802618?wa=wsignin1.0</a>&nbsp;that under File Information it refers to

            <p>Curious. Windows Update now does not report any necessary updates...so KB2802618 problem solved?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edit: problem still exists: I realise I just Hid the upgrade - hid the problem</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So back to my attempt to upgrade:</p>
<p>Alas Windows 8.1 still not appearing in my windows store yet :(</p>

<p>And when I try to install Windows KB2871389 it says The update is not applicable to your computer :(</p>

<h2>            Black Panther 4K unplayable</h2>
                    <p>Trying to play Black Panther on the Blu-Ray app and just get a black screen, then get the error about my receiver being unable to decode the audio (0x91d7000e). Had my XBox set to Atmos playback. Followed the directions to have the Xbox decode the audio, but when I can finally play the movie, the audio has a noticable scratchiness to it which makes it unwatchable to me. Switch my XBox settings to DTS playback and reenable my receiver decoding and I get the same black screen issue. My receiver, a Denon AVR-X2300W can playback and decode both Atmos and DTS and I have no issues with any other Blu-ray discs regardless of the audio choice made.</p><p><br /></p><p>What gives, Microsoft?</p>

<h3> slakin57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Back up and restore centre - unable to back up to Iomega external hard drive - getting error code 0x81000008</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell studio PC running Windows Vista home premium.</p>
<p>I have been backing up my lap top to my Iomega external hard drive vis a USB connection since May 2009. However I find I can no longer complete a succesful backup. The last succesful back up was 26/10/10 but I had been having problems with backup&nbsp;for a month
 or two prior to that time. When I try to do a back up I get the following message within a few seconds of the back up attempt;</p>
<p><em>The backup target drive G:\ failed with the following error;</em></p>
<p><em>The backup disk has a corrupted file system. Fix it using the disk error checking tool, or choose a different backup location (0x81000008)</em></p>
<p>The first time I&nbsp;used the disk error checking tool&nbsp;it worked (I also did&nbsp;a physical check of the hard drive) and I was able to do a back up (26/10/10). However the problem returned the next time I tried to do a back up and the fix has not worked since.</p>
<p>I have also backed up my husband's lap top using the same external hard drive today with no problems. He is running Windows 7. I don't think this is a problem with the Iomega hard drive therefore but a problem with the USB functionality with Windows Vista
 Home Premium. I have tried one of the suggested download fixes&nbsp;on your forums but this just resulted in a message telling me it was not relevant or appropriate (can't remember the exact wording) for my PC.</p>
<p>Please can you tell me how I can resolve this problem as I am contemplating an upgrade to Windows 7 but am not happy about having to pay for an upgrade that may or may not resolve a software problem that is not my fault.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Sue Lakin</p>

<p>Diana,</p>
<p>There aren't any file system errors on the disk as I have been able to back up my husbands lap top using Windows back up and restore with no problems since I have had the problems with my lap top running Vista&nbsp;- he is running Windows 7. Also when I used
 the disk checking programmes to check for file system issues it told me there weren't any problems.</p>
<p>I am also having problems with Windows telling me it does not recognise other USB connected accesories such as my iPhone dock and printer. Re-booting the lap top resolves the iPhone dock problem. I srongly believe this is a Windows Vista USB support problem
 not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Regards, Sue</p>

<p>I have followed the instructions given in Diana's reply. The Chkdsk program run from cmd.exe told me that there were no problems with the file system. I then ran an ad hoc back up which completed successfully.</p>
<p>It seems that the Back up and restore center program in Vista needs a formal confirmation that there are no problems with the file system before attempting a back up?</p>
<p>I have now set the back up to run at midnight every day and will see what happens. It is after I started to use this setting before that I got back ups failing. I still believe this is a software issue and not a hardware issue!</p>

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
Scroll down to the bottom
Click Windows Store Apps

Click Run the troubleshooter

When complete try opening the Store again.

Also check if the Store works in another user account. 

Press Windows key + R
Type: wsreset.exe
Hit Enter

Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.

Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 

Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm taking care of a completely corrupt Windows 10 PC that just won't boot up anymore. Only the system recovery menu will show up, so I need to do a full system recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have confirmation that this will not delete files for user accounts, such as My Documents? Or should I take out the hard drive and create a backup first?</p>
<p>

            <p>Start the PC, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do this Twice.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access the 'Reset this PC' Option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You will be asked if you want to keep: Nothing, Files Only or Files and Apps</strong></p>

    <title>Problemi di connessione Monitor esterni - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giustinom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problemi  di connessione Monitor esterni</h2>
                    Buongiorno, scrivo come ultimo tentativo per risolvere un problema che<br />
nonostante prove, aggiornamenti e consultazioni su web per casistiche simili,<br />
rimane insoluto. Ho un Noteboook Fujitsu E752 con processore Intel I5 e <br />
scheda Intel HD graphic 4000 con uscite aggiuntive VGA e Display Port.<br />
Il SO era originariamente Win7, ora aggiornato senza problemi a Win10 Pro.<br />
Se collego il Pc al televisore di casa, 26'' INNO-HIT, vecchiotto ma funzionante,<br />
tramite adattatore DisplayPort-&gt;HDMI e cavo HDMI-&gt;HDMI, il televisore viene<br />
riconosciuto e configurato, ma solo come Video ESTESO o SINGOLO (2), <br />
non come DUPLICA e non e' possibile salvare la configurazione (segnala un errore).<br />
In ogni caso, comumque, il video e' visualizzato sul TV, se sposto (estendi) un lettore<br />
multimediale su esso funziona perfettamente, l'audio si sente ecc. ma dopo meno di<br />
un minuto, la connessione viene persa e si ritorna a schermo singolo.<br />
Dato che ho gia' fatto vari esperimenti, e solo allo scopo di anticipare le domande ed<br />
i suggerimenti visti in altri post, vi riepilogo qui la situazione corrente.<br />
1) Il monitor del Notebook e' un 15.6" HD con risoluzione 1366x768 <br />
2) Il Televisore e' un 26" con ingresso HDMI e sopporta risoluzione fino a 1080i<br />
3) Il Bios e' aggiornato all'ultima versione Fujitsu disponibile per il E752,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; la scheda grafica e' aggiornata con ultimi driver disponibili (05/2019),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Win10 e' aggiornato all'ultima versione 1903 del 05/2019. <br />
4) Se collego il televisore ad un tablet Android tramite un altro cavo (microHDMI-&gt;HDMI)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; funziona tutto perfettamente.<br />
5) Se collego al televisore un altro Notebook (Asus, scheda grafica 440o con uscita
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; HDMI diretta e caratteristiche simili), tramite lo STESSO cavo HDMI-&gt;HDMI che uso per<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; collegare il Fujjitsu all'adattatore DisplayPort/HDMI, funziona tutto perfettamente.<br />
6) Se collego il Fujitsu ad un Monitor da Pc Esterno tramite uscita/cavo VGA, funziona<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; tutto in tutte le modalita' (Duplica, Estendi ecc..)<br />
7) Non ho riscontri di funzionamento con Win7, perche' con quel SO non hoi mai tentato/usato<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; questo tipo di collegamento<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Ovviamente sembrerebbe puntare tutto sull'adattatore DisplayPort-&gt;HDMI ma anche questo sembra<br />
funzionare correttamente, almeno per quei 30/45 secondi.<br />
E poi non mi spego l'errore di salvataggio delle modifiche Video in 'Impostazioni-&gt;Schermo'<br />
Cosa altro posso tentare?<br />
Grazie anticipatamente e scusate la prolissita'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            I fixed it before you&nbsp;answerd&nbsp;by downloading the windows 7 repair disk and doing a system restore form that, since doing a restore by pressing f8&nbsp;repetitively&nbsp;and doing one from there didnt work, thank you for your help anyway&nbsp;

                    <p>I have just set up my new Dell Laptop computer&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;Windows 10 installation is brand new and all updates have been applied.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are 2&nbsp;other Dell computers in my household (Dell Desktop and Dell Laptop) and all with Win 10 and neither of these display this characteristic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to apply the solution at the following link where the post&nbsp;is marked as answer but to no avail.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why two of your machines don't have the problem... </p>
<p>Do they have all of the current updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 builds of 14393.223 and earlier don't have this issue... All later ones do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news, for what it's worth, is that the problem has been fixed in the Insider Preview builds 14986&nbsp; and higher...
</p>
<p>Hopefully that means that when the new Creators build is released in the next couple of months, it will be fixed there as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose it is possible that an update for build 14393 (1607) will be released that fixes the problem before then... I keep checking..</p>
