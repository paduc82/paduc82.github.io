<h2>            Getting error 0x0000000d adding network printer</h2>
                    
<div>Hi all, Vista SP2 Ultimate x86</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am dual booting on my HP Pavilion laptop with Vista Ultimate SP2 x86 and </div>
<div>XP Pro SP3 x86. I have a home network with a wireless router and run the </div>
<div>laptop wireless.&nbsp; I have 2 desktops that are also wireless on the network</div>
<div>and connect to the one printer via a switch. I have another desktop that is </div>
<div>hard wired to the modem with a printer directly connected, and is also on </div>
<div>the home network. All the desktops can access the printer in question via </div>
<div>the network, and so can the XP Pro on the subject laptop.&nbsp; They are all set</div>
<div>up on the network properly, can share files and such just fine.&nbsp; However,</div>
<div>when I try to add/connect to the printer from the Vista on the laptop to the</div>
<div>network printer on one desktop I get the Operation could not be completed: </div>
<div>0x0000000d error.&nbsp; I have been been 3 days on the Internet looking for a</div>
<div>solution, but, thus far none of the recommendations, from command prompts to</div>
<div>registry changes has worked.&nbsp; The drivers for that printer are installed on</div>
<div>the laptop in the Vista OS and up to date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I try to add the printer from Office Word 2007 I get the error: "The</div>
<div>active directory domain services is currently unavailable."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is odd is that I can access the printer from every machine on the </div>
<div>network except the one desktop. I can access all of the drives and files on </div>
<div>that same desktop via the network, but, not the printer. I know that the </div>
<div>printer is working when I switch from the one desktop to the other from all </div>
<div>the other machines, so it is not the switch that is at fault.&nbsp; Also, I have</div>
<div>the same Vista Ultimate, SP2 x86 installed on two other desktops, which dual</div>
<div>boot with Win7 SP1, and they have no problems accessing the printer via the </div>
<div>network.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I am really confused as to what </div>
<div>could be causing the error or where to troubleshoot at this point, as it is </div>
<div>only this one Vista on this one laptop that is causing the issue.</div>

<p>After days of troubleshooting and following all the information from the Internet and even MS support with no luck, at my wits end&nbsp;I finally uninstalled the printer driver from the Device Manager, again, and
 then reinstalled it, but, this time and selected the second of two USB ports for it, and told it not to replace the existing driver. It gave the new driver the same name but with the (Copy 1) on it. I went to the other desktop and tried to add the printer
 again, and for whatever reason, or madness, it connected to the (Copy 1) printer, as did the Win7 on that desktop, and the Vista on the laptop. Now all machines are once again connected.</p>

<h2>            Dropped Computer, now only goes to blue screen and is unabe to restart. What can I do&#63;Help&#33;</h2>
                    Last night my laptop fell off of the couch. I turned it back on and it went to the screen where I can choose to restart normally or go through a systems check. I chose the check&nbsp; option, and once it finished&nbsp; which took about an hour, it attempted to restart.
 After being stuck on the startup screen for about 10 mins, it went straight to the blue one. I have done this three times, to no avail, it just wont start! Can it be fixed? Or should I just take it in, try to retrieve what files I have left and buy a new one?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Boosters</h2>
                    
<p>Can they do something about these cheats? Boosters wreck the game for everyone. They need to bust these people down to a rank of 1. Or if you get busted for boosting, you get to play in rooms with all the other boosters for a month, then after that month
 your rank drops down to 1, and your tagger name is in rainbow font so everyone knows your a cheater.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as boosting goes, I can kind of see their point. Its their job to police live, but each individual game has its own rules as far as boosting and such. Especially when in some cases the developer doesnt care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treyarch has a pretty good record for punishing boosters.</p>

<p>Just annoying when your getting destroyed in domination, then you look back at the replay and see 3 of the guys on your team and one on the other sitting in a corner off on there own shooting each other. That tactical insertion wrecks some of the games i

<p>if people are stupid enough to boost in games with random people then report them but aside from that you cant stop boosting lobbies if people just lock lobbies with their friends and only their friends. you cant join them so dont worry let treyarch deal
 with them. not like it really hurts you. but tac insersions are fun to use in demo and dom like on nuketown cause you dont get me out of your spawn and i go 100/5-20 every game so yeah</p>

<h2>            Sample Dance Songs on Windows Media Player on Windows 98.</h2>
                    I'm looking for some sample songs that came with windows media player that came with windows 98, I believe the band was called "Aspire" and they had 3 songs, one called "y2k", 2Let's Do it Now" and "Little Ray of Sunshine". This would have been from over
 10 years ago but I have been searching for it ever since, my computer broke and I never managed to hear the song again. If anyone knows it then I would be grateful if they can show me where to find it. I have been looking for it for soo long and scoured the
 internet every so often for the last decade to look for this! Since this has been soo long since I have listened to it I may even be slightly wrong about some of the details.&nbsp;

    <title>Coby Photo Viewer Software, for a Coby Photo Keychain, Model DP-161. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Coby Photo Viewer Software, for a Coby Photo Keychain, Model DP-161. </h2>
                    
<p>I have a Windows 7 computer. I'm trying to use a&nbsp;Coby Photo Keychain, Model DP-161.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the appropriate software from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cobyusa.com/?p=prod&amp;prod_num_id=80&amp;pcat_id=3001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cobyusa.com/?p=prod&amp;prod_num_id=80&amp;pcat_id=3001</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I own the model DP-161, though it appears that to the company the difference between the model DP-151 and the DP-161 is negligible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software successfully installed, and when I try to open it, it doesn't work. I get the error message "Can't find any photoviewer, or another program owns it. The program will exit!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi Jad91,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Are you able to see the Coby Photo keychain device in Computer window?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and try to connect your Coby Photo keychain and check if it works on the software.
 If the Coby Photo keychain is detected and if it works, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this does not help, you may have to contact Coby support to check if you need to make any changes in their software for the device to be detected in
 their software. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I got it to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the software, uninstalled the driver, unplugged the device, and tried again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I inserted the CD that came with the device (it didn't autoplay, and install itself, so I had to search the files on the CD), followed it to the folder "MARS for Windows", and began the setup. It installed the software. (The software from the CD must be
 different from what Coby provides online because the icon has changed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I plugged the device back in. The program wouldn't recognize that the device was plugged in yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I let my computer automatically find and install the necessary drivers for the device, and then tried opening the program again.&nbsp;Viola.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's how to get it to work for those who have the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's additional information. I tried reinstalling the online version so that I could compare it to the CD version. I left the CD version open while I installed the online one. The online one replaced the CD one, icon, and everything, but the program was
 still open and&nbsp;usable. I tried closing it and reopening it and it gave me the same error message "Can't find any photoviewer, or another program owns it. The program will exit!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I guess the older version on the CD (which I believe was intended for Windows 98SE, 2000, XP) is able to run on Windows 7.</p>
<p>On the CD, under "Drivers for Windows Vista" and opened "windows vista device driver setup" it mentions "Device driver in Windows Vista can not be installed with setup.exe because lack of privilege. Here are the suggestion to facilitate device driver installation
 in Windows Vista."</p>
<p>I've right clicked on the icon for the program and looked at Properties. I noticed the compatibility tab, and the option to run it in compatibility mode for different versions of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, the online version of the program has issues with with the drivers that Windows 7 installs? While the older, CD version of the program functions like it would in&nbsp;Windows 98SE, 2000, XP, and Windows 7 is automatically setting up a compatibility mode
 for it?</p>

            If the laptop was reimaged using the schools own Windows 8 image, then that means it probably uses a different mechanism for updates. So instead of updating directly through Windows Update, if you log into a domain, it uses Windows Software Update Services
 which managed by your schools IT department.

<p>Should Have mentioned that eh Gwyther lol,sorry mate. It's a PSP and I just plug the cords into the proper ends,turn on said PSP and select "USB Connection",it links so when I select the music sorce and choose "Storage Device" then I select "Play All" and
 thats when the message appears. Now I've played music this way in the past and never had issues. I do have a different music selection. Instead in MP3 format (or whatever it was back then) these are format listed as AAC (A4C). I don't know if this is a cause
 but ANY help would be great. Gotta rock out to Tiger Army as I'm gamin' it up!</p>

<p>Hey there String, sorry I missed your last post. So I'm fairly sure using a PSP as a storage device is not supported on the console. We can test out if the functionality is at least working on your console by having you try this same process, but with a
 standard USB storage device, like a thumb drive. Try using the same file format, as well as trying MP3. Let me know what happens, and we can narrow down the issue here. Thanks!

<h2>            Volume lowering while in a call.</h2>
                    Say I call someone like my sister, or my friend. Whenever I'm in a call, it lowers (the volume of) everything else open on my computer and then puts it back to normal and repeats this process over and over. I looked this problem up a while ago and was
 able to fix it by changing a setting on my computer. But apparently this new problem isn't common and I wasn't able to find anything. If anyone knows why this is or if it has happened to you before, please tell me.

<h2>            Windows 10 does not boot after installation</h2>
                    <p>August 25, 2015</p>
<p>I need help on my son's PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 10 a few weeks ago to my laptop and it works perfectly. I had Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, my son downloaded Windows 10 (He had Windows 7) and it has been a continuous reboot loop for hours. It starts like normal and goes to a "Welcome Back" page. The only option is to click on "Next" and it reboots. I have tried to start in safe
 mode but nothing seems to work. I tried holding the shift key down during one of the reboots and nothing happened. I never get an opening page with a "Start Menu".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put the original Windows 7 CD in and was able to boot from that. I tried the "fix windows" option and it showed that windows 10 was installed. It was "thinking" for a long time but eventually it was back to the same welcome page/reboot issue. Again from
 the CD I tried to restore to a prior time, but there is no prior time available. I also tried to fix the memory. When it rebooted it said it was fixing the BIOS, but again when it restarted I was back to the same welcome page/reboot hell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install non-destructive Windows 7, but I can't do that without being in my system. I believe I could do a clean install of Windows 7 from the disc, but then all of my son's programs and information would have to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have any other options? If Microsoft does an update that would fix this issue, would it automatically install with one of the reboots? Even if I never am past the welcome menu?</p>

</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps. Please </p>
<p>follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do
 so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 ISO files and&nbsp;create an installation media.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />

<p>In your Mouse without Borders settings, you can change the "layout" of your monitors so that the program knows where your monitors are physically located and can make the pointer move appropriately.&nbsp; In short it just sounds like they are reversed and need

Hi</p>
<p>Is the new computer running a 64Bit version of Windows? If so, you cannot run any 16Bit programs on that operating system.</p>
<p>You will need to install another 32bit operating system and set up a dual boot configuration, or use one of the Virtual machine solutions.</p>

            <p>You can't schedule a time if you want to use Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You first have to change your Windows Update settings to Notify you when updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Start, then </p>
<p>Click on Settings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Click on Update and Security.&nbsp;&nbsp; The window opens with Windows Update in the right hand panel.&nbsp;

<p>Click on Advanced Options.</p>
<p>Under Choose How Updates Are Installed</p>
<p>Select Notify to Schedule Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's as good as it gets with the Windows 10 settings.&nbsp; Windows Update is no longer in the Control Panel.&nbsp; I have not seen any references to using the Task Scheduler to do this, so I would bet the option doesn't exist.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Install - No Disc, just the legal product key</h2>
                    Ok. I have just inherited a slow PC with WIN7 and I have a fast PC with WIN XP. I have legal keys for both.<br />
<br />
What I need is an easy to follow, step by step process to install WIN7 on the fast PC.<br />
<br />
I have External hard drives available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks, Gareth<br />

            Sorry, I obviously did not make myself clear.<br />
<br />
I intend to format the hard drive on the faster PC and I want to install Win7. I have a legal legal key for this but not a cd or dvd.<br />
<br />
The information above doesn't give me a step by step answer as requested.<br />

            Hi Gareth,
<div>&nbsp; If the version of Win7 you have access to is OEM installed then Win7 is tied to the "slow PC's" hardware. &nbsp;If you install Win7 on the fast PC using the license obtained from the slow PC you won't be able to activate it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If however you have a retail version of Win 7 all you have to do is download whichever version of Win7 your slow PC will support then use this
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
tool</a>&nbsp;to generate the USB or DVD install disc:</div>
<div><a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58996.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58996.iso</a> - (x86)</div>

<div>The above are legal download channels if you have a valid product key</div>
<div><br />
<div>Proceed with the install on the Win7 install on the fast PC using the following as a guide:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7#T1=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7#T1=tab01</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once it comes time to activate your install on the fast PC you may need to call MS Customer support to transfer the license, but your slow PC will need to be formatted first.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            Hi Martin,&nbsp; well this sort of helps.<br />
<br />
I have Win7 Professional 32 bit.<br />
<br />
Retail? Means nothing to me. I understand the difference between retail and wholesale but in this context it means nothing to me.<br />
<br />
I don't want to upgrade my Win XP. I want a clean install.<br />

<p>To do this, you either pick the F key on the computer's initialization screen which allows you to pick the boot device, the DVD drive, or you go into BIOS and physically change the boot order priority, making the DVD drive the top priority.</p>

            Hi Mike<br />
<br />
Thanks for moving things on a little. So i need to create a Windows 7 ISO file.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately none of the links on the page quoted help with this.<br />
<br />
What I need is a step by step procedure, as I am not experienced in doing this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
And once the ISO file is created, what then?<br />
<br />
Yours, Gareth<br />

            Hi Gareth
<div>&nbsp; If you're using the install keys on the bottom of your laptop or the side of your PC - it's more than likely you've got an OEM installed version. If that's the case you're out of luck. Check the sticker underneath your laptop or on the side of your PC
 - it will tell you if it's OEM...</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have a retail version i.e. retail purchased in a store or as an MS download the license key would've been attached to the boxed media - I'm guessing since you don't have the install media, that it's not retail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This should help you discover whether you have a retail version or not:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/211083-determining-whether-oem-retail-via-mgadiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/211083-determining-whether-oem-retail-via-mgadiag.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW I know you want a clean install but the link I provided:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7#T1=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7#T1=tab01</a>&nbsp;will
 install the lastest updates available for the install. I realise the link indicates that its "upgrading" your OS but if you read through the instructions - it's not an upgrade per-say as there is no complete end to end upgrade of WinXP to Win7, you're essentially
 just moving files and settings to the new OS</div>
<div><br />
<div>If however you really want a clean install you can use these instructions:</div>
<div><a href="https://www.sctxca.org/suncity/clubs-groups/sites/computer/sigs/kfklatch/articles/Win7_InstallWin7OverXP.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sctxca.org/suncity/clubs-groups/sites/computer/sigs/kfklatch/articles/Win7_InstallWin7OverXP.htm</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure you download all the Win7 drivers you need before you perform the install for your fast PC. The drivers should go on your external HD so you can plug it in and install them once Win7 finishes it's install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Gareth,
<div>&nbsp; The link I quoted in my first post under "tool" links to software that allows you to burn a DVD or make a bootable USB installer for Win7. It's as straight forward as it comes, once you have the DVD in your disc drive or plugged into your USB port you
 just restart your PC - it should auto-run the installer and the install instructions take over from there:</div>

<br />
Thanks for your help but to be honest I can fully understand why people hack/copy Windows software.<br />
<br />
I have a valid license to the software but are unable to use it on the pc I want to use. Like buying petrol that can only be used in a certain car.<br />
<br />
As for the Microsoft website, it makes me wonder how they ever got to where they are. Certainly, it won't be for much longer. Today's MS, is tomorrows IBM!<br />
<br />
Thanks, Gareth<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which user account are you using Administrator, Standard or Guest?</p>
<p>It’s glad to know that your issue had been resolved. If the computer is asking for administrator permission you need to log into administrator account. You can also try temporarily
 disabling the User Account Control settings and check if it helps: </p>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative
 rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.

<h2>            OS update caused Windows-10 to lock up after 20-30 minutes</h2>
                    An OS update from about a week or two ago caused headphone audio out to go dead (even though the control panel does see the signal) AND Windows-10 locks up after 20-30 minutes, regardless of activity.&nbsp; Need suggestions for resolving these issues.

            Hi Crunch,
<br />
<br />Its likely the January or February updates. 
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings

<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability is restore. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Hi Crunch.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to fix it If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu. 
<br />
<br />If problems persist:
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
