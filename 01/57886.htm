    <title>All USB connections failing at once - Windows 10, February 2018 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            All USB connections failing at once - Windows 10, February 2018</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 desktop. It has had ongoing issues with USB connections, some USB connected external drives disconnecting for no good reason, and some time beginning in early February 2018, every time I started up this computer, it'd have all the USB
 connected peripherals suddenly disconnect simultaneously, about 2-4 hrs. after startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as of this morning, the situation has deteriorated further. NONE of the system's ten or so USB connections work, even when first starting up this PC.&nbsp; I cannot connect the keyboard or mouse, even, now, it's no longer possible to have the mouse or keyboard
 connect without any external drives, flash drives, etc, and I'm at this point stuck using a local wi-fi connection between my iPad and the PC to type this message via remote access app. If not for the fact that that connection was previously set up I wouldn't
 even be able to log into my Windows system at all.</p>
<p>I am going to roll back the last 2 weeks of system updates and hopefully that will fix this glitch.<br />
</p>
<p>But if that doesn't solve it...</p>
<p>Please, somebody, provide an actual solution to this and not the same dozen obvious ideas I've seen over and over across the internet, none of which are applicable to a situation in which an entire batch of USB ports all fail simultaneously.</p>

            Hello Matt, <br />
<br />
<br />
Corrupted components related to USB driver can be one of the factors why this issue occurs. As an initial troubleshooting step, we'd recommend running the
<em><strong>Windows USB Troubleshooter</strong></em> to diagnose and repair any broken components that's causing this issue. To do this, download this troubleshooter on this
<em><strong><a href="http://aka.ms/EasyFix_WinUSB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>, locate the file in the download folder, right-click on it and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>. Then, follow the on-screen prompts.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>After running the troubleshooter, try connecting your USB devices again and check if the issue persists.
</em><br />
<br />
In addition, we'd recommend updating your <em><strong>USB driver</strong></em> to eliminate any conflicts that's causing this issue. To be guided on this, click on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>.
<br />
<br />
In the event that the above steps doesn't suffice, we'd recommend checking if your
<em><strong>BIOS</strong></em> (<em><strong>Basic Input Output System</strong></em>) is up-to-date. If you're not comfortable with troubleshooting BIOS, you can contact the manufacturer of your device for assistance.
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Important:</strong></em> <em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</em><br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for an update with the outcome and let us know if you need more help.&nbsp;

<h2>            explorer.exe keeps crashing every few seconds in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows 8.1 since october, and while the Laptop used to have Windows 7 64-bit, this was a fresh install on a brand new hard drive. Last night however, Explorer.exe was constantly restarting and it was impossible to do anything. I've tried
 updating and running a scan with malwarebytes but nothing I do seems to stop this behavior. Looking in the event log, I found this:</p>

            <p>I'll just add that from the dump file&nbsp;there are five third party&nbsp;modules that are&nbsp;potential candidates for the cause of the explorer.exe crashing in Normal Mode (bolded):</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for
<strong>hccutils.dll </strong>- </em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for <strong>
igfxcpl.cpl</strong> - </em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for <strong>
ClassicStartMenuDLL.dll</strong> - </em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for sppc.dll -
</em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for <strong>
guard64.dll</strong> - </em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.&nbsp; Defaulted to export symbols for <strong>
DTShl64.dll </strong>- </em><br />
<em>Probably caused by : verifier.dll ( verifier!VerifierStopMessage+28a )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The hccutils.dll and igfxcpl.cpl are components of the Intel graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ClassicStartMenuDLL.dll is a component of Classic Shell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guard64.dll is a component of&nbsp;COMODO Internet Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DTShl64.dll is a component of DAEMON Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is a possibility that the module causing the crash in Normal Mode may also be causing or contributing to the issue in Safe Mode as a third party module may load&nbsp;in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would start by uninstalling, at least temporarily,&nbsp;Classic Shell and&nbsp;uninstall and reinstall&nbsp;the Intel&nbsp;graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the issue(s) may be account related so if nothing works try creating a new user account and see if the issue(s) exist in that user account.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, it doesn't. Passwords are stored in encrypted form in the user profile along with other account data. Because the encryption key is generated from computer-specific stuff, the encrypted password would only work on exactly that configuration - so it probably
 wouldn't survive a format anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a copy of your store folder as it was before the format? If nothing else was done to the machine, it's worth trying to get the passwords from the account configuration files.</p>

 That's why I decided to Recover my notebook to it's original factory programs with my Recovery Cds.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Display Scaling issue with Metro Modern UI and Charms Bar</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a 4k 32" (3840x2160) monitor running on a native resolution 3840x2160 at 30 hz off an intel HD 4600 onboard graphics using windows 8.1. I have my display scaled at 250% (extra extra large) under control panel display settings. Everything
 works fine except that this scaling option doesn't affect the metro UI and charms bar. For some reason those do not get scaled up when altering the sizing option in control panel display settings. However, there is an option to decrease the size of the metro
 UI and charms bar or maintain the default size when you open the charms bar, enter settings, change pc settings, pc and devices, display, more options, change the size of apps, text and other items on this screen. I've done some research online and I've noticed
 that on some computers people have an extra option to enlarge the metro UI, however mine is only limited to default and smaller. So my question, is it possible to scale up the size of the metro UI and charms bar to match the 250% scaling I've setup in my display
 settings? And why does my computer lack the enlarge option for customizing my display?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reducing screen resolution does make the metro UI and charms bar increase in size, but I don't want to do that. I want to use native screen resolution.</p>
<p>I've tried scaling different sizes as well as custom scaling sizes and nothing changes.</p>
<p>I've changed the logical dpi override values in the registry editor and nothings works.</p>
<p>I've tried a third party software to increase metro UI and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you help guys.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm sorry Neha, but did you even bother reading what I wrote down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried all those methods mentioned on the two links you posted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are only two methods to scale your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Control panel --&gt; display --&gt; change the size of all items</p>
<p>(this method does not scale the metro modern UI as well as the Charms bar)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. charms bar --&gt; settings --&gt; change pc settings --&gt; pc and devices --&gt; display --&gt; more options --&gt; change the size of apps, text and other items on this screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>(only two options are available, default and smaller)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second method is missing a third option, which is change the size to larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read what I'm writing before you simply brush me off and post links that don't even correspond to my issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If windows 8.1 can't scale 4k monitors properly just let me know, I'll try windows 10 and see if the metro UI can be scaled with the newer OS. Or else I'll just give up on the charms bar and metro UI altogether. Everything is always a disaster with windows.&nbsp;</p>

            The display driver for intel graphics HD 4600 is already upto date with the most current version. I just want to simply know why the metro modern UI and Charms Bar can only decrease in scaling size and not increase in scaling size? And decreasing resolution
 to non native setting is obviously not an option because that just defeats the whole scaling purpose provided by windows 8.1.&nbsp;

    <title>dpc_watchdog_violation after recent windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            dpc_watchdog_violation after recent windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
After a recent update I have been getting a BSOD telling me to search up dpc_watchdog_violation. Most people seem to have issues related with their drivers, but I am not entirely sure that is the issue occurring with mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to happen randomly after I have started up my computer. I am always able to reach my desktop, but between 30 secs to 10 minutes later everything begins to freeze. After everything on the screen freezes for a few moments it brings me to the BSOD
 recommending that I look up dpc_watchdog_violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating all of my drivers through the device manager, but that has not seemed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions that could help me troubleshoot this issue would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 1:</p>
<p>It seems to happen more often when I attempt to connect to the internet and stream something like a video, twitch stream, or anything like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2:</p>
<p>I have followed additional steps to try and fix the problem such as reinstalling the drivers for my display adapter, which seemed to work for some, and reinstalling my internet browsers which others had issues with. I also tried turning off fast startup.
 None of these worked and I am still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 3:</p>
<p>I was going through the following thread as it seemed to be close to my issue, but I found that I had the latest driver for my network adapter.</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/blue-screen-of-death-dpc-watchdog-violation/16ad6e33-ec1c-4566-b0fe-a5e6028a3bb7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem does not occur in safe mode with networking on, appears to only be caused by streaming media.</p>

<p>Hi UserName3,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If reinstalling or updating device drivers did not resolve the issue, we may try to simply roll back the problematic driver to the last good configuration. Incorrectly configured network driver, touchpad driver, SATA AHCI driver and graphics card driver
 are responsible for DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION blue screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To roll back a driver to the last good configuration, you may follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your Bluetooth driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out. </p>
<p>
</p>

<p>Hello Aileen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the areas that you requested, but the&nbsp;<strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option was grayed out for the network driver, SATA AHCI driver, and graphic cards driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced that the issue is focused on the Wi-Fi adapter as the BSOD only occurs when I am browsing on the internet and some stream-able media appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other options?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that's wrong.</p>
<p>I tore apart a dead Xbox 360 battery and found it has (2x) 1.2V AA Ni-Mh cells for a total capacity of 4800mAh.
</p>
<p>Judging by specs on available Ni-Mh cells, clearly the specs from Insignia branded batteries can't be right, either. &nbsp;There are no Ni-Mh AA cells that would produce 1200mAh capacity.</p>
<p>Based on the 360 battery, and since you can use the exact same (2x) 1.5V AA alkaline cells in an Xbox One and in a 360 controller, clearly the rechargeable cells are going to be (2x) 1.2V-1.5V in the One controller as well. &nbsp;They could the Li-ion but, it's
 unlikely for a number of reasons. &nbsp;Either way, they'd have a capacity of at least 4000mAh.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what *** me off, though. &nbsp;Microsoft warns consumers not to use 1.2V Ni-Mh cells in their controllers, but then they package those exact cells in their MS branded batteries. &nbsp;Lies! &nbsp;They just want to rip you off.</p>
<p>Screw it, I'm buying a bunch of Ni-Mh batteries and calling it DONE!</p>

            Hi Albert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hi Albert Well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support SCAM 
<br />
<br />Rest assured your PC is not infected, this is just a scam, if your PC locks up when this appears, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) then on the Processes Tab, find your browser and end Task on that
<br />
<br />You can then continue working on your PC
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Terminal mode is not included in Windows 7. There are several options you can use to accomplish the same tasks:<br />
If you only need remote shell access, you can use WinRS (Windows Remote Shell).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To open WinRS, follow these steps:<br />
1. Go to start and type in cmd in search box and press enter.<br />
2. In the command prompt, type <strong>winrs /?</strong> and press enter.<br />
<br />
There are also many other third party terminal programs. Please search using your favorite search engine for more information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly.<br />
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at<br />
your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Windows 7 professional or Ultimate, then You can install XP Mode on your computer and Hyper terminal
 will be available to you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade and a Dell Latitude E5410 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radaley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade and a Dell Latitude E5410</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows 10 update ISO file. &nbsp;I have upgraded this laptop to Windows 10 three or four times. When it's done and I reboot, I get past the Dell BIOS screen and then I get a blank screen. At this point I would revert back to Windows 7 and all is good.
 &nbsp;Then I try again and same thing happens every time. &nbsp;I thought it was a problem, but eventually put my hands on an external monitor and "what do you know?" there's the Windows 10 login screen and everything is working fine... except the laptop monitor. (!!!)</p>
<p>I've checked Dell &amp; Intel for an updated video driver.. nope.. I've got the latest and greatest, and Dell is not updating any drivers for this model.</p>
<p><strong>Anybody know a good work around?</strong> &nbsp;What's the point of having a laptop, if you have to haul an external monitor around to see what your doing?</p>

<h2>            Turtle Beach x12 isn&#39;t recognized as a microphone on Windows 8.</h2>
                    I just got a headset called Turtle Beach x12, and while it is an XBOX 360 hardware, it's supposed to be able to work for the PC too. So after I plugged everything in (the mic jack/the headphone jack/USB jack), I tried to configure it in sound and Sound
 will only recognize the internal microphone. I don't know how to make it work. Help?

                    I have had this blue screen message pop up numerous times times, normally right in the middle of me trying to get some work done. How do I fix it? This seems to be a very common problem. My laptop is now frozen at 60% and I'm scared to switch off-can I?

            You can switch off and switch on. This generally happens due to display driver. But there may be other causes as well.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Dave
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC and see if it starts normally
<br />
<br />Most likely this is caused by a corrupt video card device driver, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Skype for Linux &#40;CentOS7&#41; Login to &#42;Internal&#42; Microsoft Exchange Service</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Good morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a system administrator responsible for supplying application support to Linux users.&nbsp; I just downloaded and installed Skype For Linux x64 on my CentOS7.3 (KDE4) workstation today (5/16/18).&nbsp; We do have an internal MS Exchange server which we use on our
 Windows 10 workstations and Skype for Business works fine on that setup.&nbsp; Our Linux users have requested Skype as Pidgin just doesn't work properly for their functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can't figure out how to get the Linux Skype to log into our internal service.&nbsp; When I launch it, I get the screen for logging in, but when I click "Sign In" I get an error message that says "Unable to sign in, please check your internet connection
 and try again."&nbsp; Also, most of the menu items (including Tools -&gt; Settings) are not clickable.&nbsp; We are on a secure internal network with no connection to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm unsure how to set up this app to connect to our internal MS service.&nbsp; We are not running a firewall on our workstations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot push this application out to my users until this issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Unfortunately the standard version of Skype requires Interent (WAN) access to interface wtih the Microsoft/Skype cloud. LAN access with or without an Exchange server, will not suffice. You wll need to find another localized/standalone solution.

<p>Skype for Linux is designed for the standard consumer version of Skype, not Skype for Business. They are two different products. Connecting to the standard version of Skype requires WAN access regardless of the OS used. There is no LAN-only version. I have
 personally tested out the standard Skype client in Windows with WAN access on a LAN (LAN user to LAN user), killed WAN access and the call would not survive very long before it was dropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a thread reconfirming there is currently no Skype for Business client for Linux.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well since it seems to be an update try this :<br />
<br />
Run System Restore again - immediately after it completes Control Panel - Windows<br />
Update - change Settings - set to download but let you install them. The install them<br />
individually to see if the culprit can be determined. Sometimes when updates are<br />
installed individually the problem does not show back up. Remember to reset the<br />
Settings back to automatic.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Task bar Icon for Word and&#47;or Excel, right click to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Task bar Icon for Word and&#47;or Excel, right click to show recent files.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Task bar Icon for Word and/or Excel, right click to show recent or pinned files. How do I get the recent files to list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at all the properties as well as windows 10 options for both programs and I can only affect the recent files once the program is opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: In Windows 8 you can right click the Word icon and a list of recent files shows up, usually up to 8 files. You can then select specific files to be pinned. The pinned files are there but never any recent files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change this or is this a feature that is gone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft 365 Home. I have updated both Windows 10 and my Microsoft suite applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks =)</p>

<p>Okay - I had to go outside Microsoft to get some tips on this...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/clear-recent-items-windows-jumplists/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have worked like a charm! I can now see 3 of my files that I just opened, including re pinning a personal template to open a new document with my set parameters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully now Microsoft will have this for their users to view...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            Hi 68Karma
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Personalization - Start
<br />
<br />Turn on 'Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Start and Taskbar'
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>I can play online just fine, but if I'm playing campaign or in a score attack match on Halo, It disconnects me. Even if I just sit idle for a few min. If I'm playing in things Like BTB or Infection (Things where other gamers are) I've got no problems.. &nbsp;Nobody
 else in my house has these issues. And there's another Xbox and a PC running online at all times.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;(it won't let me copy and paste, so i'm going to have to do this to the best of my ability)&nbsp;<br />
<br />

Modem Brand and Model Number: &nbsp; unknown.<br />
&nbsp;Router Brand and Model Number: &nbsp;unknown.<br />

<p>Hey mate, I think there's something else at work besides simply being on LIVE alone. Is there an error message when you're disconnected? Also, do you have issues when playing with friends while the other Xbox 360 is running?

            You have an issue with your CPU. 1 core is not responding correctly. Update the BIOS and check your CPU&nbsp; your errors (Prime95). How old is the Dell? Do you have warranty? If yes, contact Dell.

<p>Check the troubleshooting methods listed there along with ones in the troubleshooter above.</p>
<p>This can be hardware however you might get lucky checking software causes. Do not forget to<br />
check to low level chipset drives at the System maker's or motherboard maker's sites as well as<br />
other drivers.<br />
