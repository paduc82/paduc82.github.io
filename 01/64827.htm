<p>Hi Jude,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 15063.447 is the current build as of June 27, 2017—KB4022716 (OS Build 15063.447)</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4022716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4022716</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget KB4020102, it is old and no longer applicable to your device. The updates are cumulative, this means that each subsequent cumulative update contains all prior update files as well as the new and any that are required to bring the device up-to-date
 will be installed in the required order necessary.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If in doubt check your update history. If you wish you can post a snapshot of the update history window in your next reply and we'll take a look at it for you.</p>

<p>Since KB4022716 (Win10 1703, OS Build 15063.447) successfully installed and since KB4022716 supersedes (replaces) KB4020102, don't worry about&nbsp;KB4020102 (or KB4022725)&nbsp;failing to install. That being said...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the full name of your installed Norton application and when does your current subscription expire?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a Norton free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.<br />
</li><li>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may&nbsp;have been&nbsp;your troublemaker here. If not, chances are they'll cause problems later.</li></ul>

<h2>            factory reset windows 7 stuck during installation</h2>
                    I have an eMachine desktop that crashed on me two days ago. I used a recovery disc to get windows operating again but it was still running slow so I decided to do a factory reset on it. It was running through the re-installation perfectly until it got
 to the software installation of Office 2010. It has been stuck on this for 2 hours now, so I rebooted the computer and it took me back to the exact same spot. It will not move forward to finishing the installation. Please help!

            <p>I had this issue with a client so I shut the pc down and booted into safe mode. Then I opened msconfig and turned everything off that was related to acer/emachine. I then went into the hidden c:\OEM\preload folder and deleted the office 2010 folder and rebooted
 and it started up again, skipped that 4th option and jumped to 5 and was done.&nbsp; I went in and turned everything back on in the msconfig except the acer\preload and rebooted straight to the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure it was just deleting the office 2010 folder but if that doesn't cut it then try killing all the startup options and kill the acer/emachine services. I am not going through that again to find out what did the trick.:-)</p>

    <title>Windows 10, Lenovo Thinkpad, No Audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beansburns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, Lenovo Thinkpad, No Audio</h2>
                    <p>Shortly after I got my Thinkpad this summer, while watching a Youtube video, something happened and the audio suddenly cut off. However, the computer believed that the audio was just fine; when running the audio test service, the indicator bar lit up in
 green despite absolute silence even at 100% volume. This was true both for the speakers and for headphones. No suggested solution had any effect---restarting the Windows Audio Service didn't work, updating or rolling back the drivers didn't work, and nothing
 the Troubleshooter service suggested worked. The computer consistently indicated that it thought sound was occurring despite the very real lack of any audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After no more than 2 weeks, sound was back just as if nothing had happened. Now, about a month later, a similar situation has occured. The difference, however, is that this time Windows actually informed me there had been "a problem" (complete with a light-blue
 screen of dread and a frowny emoticon) and it needed to restart. When it restarted, the audio was again nowhere to be found. I ran Troubleshooter and updated the drivers, and I tried fiddling with the Windows Audio Service. Again, there has been no result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure that the issue cannot be with the drivers, nor the Audio Service, nor the audio enhancements (which I have turned off, not that it did anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: To clarify, this issue is not limited to sounds originating from Youtube or from my browser, but the entirety of sound output from my computer. This is why I do not think the issue is at all related to my browser or to Youtube.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key + R,</em></strong> then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the exact make and model of your device?</li><li>Does the issue only happen when you play videos in YouTube?</li><li>What browser are you using? Have you tried using a different browser?</li><li>What is the error message you've received when your computer went into a blue screen state?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>A stop error (also called a "blue screen" error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. These errors can be caused by either hardware or software issues. Meanwhile, we recommend performing the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to troubleshoot blue screen errors on Windows 10.</p>

<p>3. I should clarify, and will clarify in the OP: this is&nbsp;<em>not</em> limited to Youtube and extends to all instances of sound on my computer.</p>
<p>4. This question is probably not relevant given the issue is wholly separate from browser use.</p>
<p>5. I can't remember exactly, but it said something along the lines of "something went wrong" or "there's been a problem" rather than stating any exact issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notably, the blue screen did not occur the first time the sound issue arose.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting us know. Have you tried uninstalling the audio drivers and let Windows choose the generic drivers automatically? If not, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <strong><em>devmgmt.msc</em></strong> and press Enter.</p>
<p>2. Right-click on the name of the audio driver (<span>Realtek High Definition Audio)</span>, and select
<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This did not have the desired effect. I uninstalled the device as instructed. However, I saw no "Windows generic driver" and the Realtek HD Audio driver re-installed itself automatically within minutes. When tested, the speakers again claimed to be producing
 audio despite the complete lack of any sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was I supposed to specify that the driver should be deleted?</p>

<p>I followed the steps you advised, including specifying that the Realtek HD Audio Drivers should be deleted. They are still present somehow, and sound is still not working.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b981be8-611a-4ac6-9c6a-6970d5497f28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b981be8-611a-4ac6-9c6a-6970d5497f28" /></a></p>
<p>These are my audio drivers. Realtek HD Audio refuses to go away even though I checked the box specifying that it should be deleted, and despite the fact that I disabled the automatic device installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: After making this post, I did the same thing again, uninstalling the device and specifying the deletion of the audio drivers. Within minutes, the driver returned, leaving my Device Manager looking as it does in the picture. I have not seen any trace
 of a "generic Windows audio driver".</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You can consider performing a rollback for the audio adapter driver. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Device Manager by pressing the <strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>R</strong>, type
<em><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></em>, and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Expand <strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>. If your audio driver is not located in Sound, video and game controllers, then you can consider checking it under
<strong>Other devices</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Right-click the audio adapter driver, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Driver</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Roll back driver</strong>.<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> button is only available if a previous version of the driver was installed. If the current driver for the device is the only one that was ever installed on this computer, then the Roll Back Driver
 button is not enabled.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.<br />

<p>Roll Back Driver is not available. However, I may have made some discoveries after checking "show hidden devices":</p>

<p>I wonder if "Microsoft Trusted Audio Drivers" is the "generic audio driver" you were talking about. However, there is a problem with them:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98c6b702-9a35-42ec-9936-db83d140af34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98c6b702-9a35-42ec-9936-db83d140af34" /></a></p>

            Based on the information you have provided, considering that you have done updating (uninstall and reinstall) the driver, rolling back to the previous driver and the issue persisted, then it's possible that the issue is due to a faulty hardware or an issue
 with the device itself. You can consider contacting the manufacturer of your device for advanced assistance.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here you may try making a movie or video file by adding the pictures and video in movie maker on your computer and then try burning the dvd on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For more information on making Movie you may refer this below provided microsoft help article.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Make a movie in four simple steps</strong><br />

When making a DVD, you first need to add your videos and pictures. (If you add pictures, they'll play as a slide show on your DVD.) You can arrange your videos and slide show in Windows DVD Maker to change their order on your final DVD. After that, you can
 preview your DVD to see how it looks, customize it, or start to burn it.<br />

<p>Esto va dirigido en especifico a <strong>EPIC GAMES,</strong>porque ya muchas personas nos encontramos muy inconformes con la grandiosa idea de incorporar esa "escopeta recortada" si se le puede llamar asi, y esto a ayudado a perder la escencia del juego,porque
 que sentido tiene que disparar un solo tiro se llegue a matar hasta 4 personajes y luego salir hullendo ya que su recarga es otra cosa ilogica tanto estupida.Y ya se que en la beta tambien se produjeron muchas quejas al respecto de esa escopeta y no hicieron
 nada,pero si talves nos quejamos todos tendremos alguna posibilidad de que arreglen esta absurda idea de la querida
<strong>EPIC GAMES.</strong></p>

<p>Yo uso retro lancer y sniper en su oportunidad y lanza llamas pero raro es el que las utiliza pues siempre usan escopeta gansher o recortada es la mamada.</p>

<p>Interesante solucion de alguien que se la pasa en reach.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Yo te recomiendo usarla total la hamerbust, retro lancer y lancer no son efectivas en mapas cortos o pequeños y es en tonces donde solo usan escopetas, entonces usala tu tambien.</p>

<p>Lo mas que puede pasar es que tu y tu enemigo se maten, ODIO LOS EMPATES.</p>

<p>Si quieres hacer una queja sobre el game play de GOW, Hazlo en los foros de EPIC GAMES, aquí ni por casualidad te van a leer.</p>
<p>Ahora respecto a la recortada, que mata a cuatro de un disparo ¿qué hacen los 4 tan pegados como para matarlos de un disparo de recortada?
</p>
<p>Ahora, la recortada tiene su deficiencia, que necesitas dar el disparo casi a quemaropa y la recarga es bastante jodida, así que tiene su desventaja.</p>
<p>Que se esconden en una vuelta para matar . . . pues es un juego bélico, y se supone que NO debes ir 'como pedro por su casa' debes irte cuidando paso a paso, preparado para recibir un ataque de cualquier parte.</p>
<p>Y si te parece tan noob y tan fácil de matar ¿porqué no cambias a recortada y los matas a todos como venganza, en lugar de estarte quejando? [yo no uso la escopeta &nbsp;recortada, utilizó variado, y según sea el caso]</p>
<p>¿La escopeta es de p*tos?</p>
<p>JAJA, esa no sabía, ¿entonces cuál es el arma que se debe usar?</p>
<p>¿La lancer y disparar de lejos?, pues es GOW, no HALO . . .</p>
<p>Todas las armas tienen ventajas y desventajas, ¿alguna les causa conflicto porque los matan demaciado?</p>
<p>Aprendan a usarla, dominenla y reconocerán sus desventajas, y eso les ayudará a saber cómo defenderse ante cada arma.</p>
<p>Si les es muy complicado aprender a manejar armas nuevas en partidas públicas, siempre está la opción de partidas privadas vs. bots en informal.</p>
<p>Saludos.</p>

<p>Lo peor de todo es que hay muchos novatos que se acrercan caminando y te matan con esa porqueria, asi tu le estes tirando todo el cartucho de cualquier arma. Sigue habiendo mucha inconcistencia en las armas y eso pasa desde el GoW 1, le he disparada a weyes
 la gnasher a menos de 1 cm y no los reviente. Yo si veo la recortada muy de novatos, sigue siendo igual que en la beta solo que le quitaron un poco de poder para que ya no te derribe desde lejos, en cambio la retro si la arreglaron, para disparar a ciegas
 se mueve mucho. Pero creanme que todo eso no es tan malo a comparacion del super rapid fire de algunos idiotas que se creen invencibles con esa estupidez. Eso es lo que deberia de arreglar epic.</p>

                    <p>We're having a problem getting the rear camera to work with an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application developer says the problem is with the driver for the rear camera. LifeCam Rear driver is version 6.3.9600.17217 dated 2006-06-21. Clicking on the Update Driver option in the Device Manager just gets the same driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've run all windows updates for tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't located another updated driver for the rear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you point me to an updated driver for the rear camera? </p>

<h2>            CBS log is HUGE and taking up my entire disk&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I had more than 300 GB free on my hard drive.&nbsp; Today, I started getting errors saying that I was out of disk space.&nbsp; After some checking, it's the CBS file in c:\windows\logs\CBS -- it's 180 GB+ and apparently growing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's causing this and how do I make it stop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS running Windows 10.&nbsp; My machine was acting funny a few weeks ago so I wiped it, did a clean install of Windows 10, is fully patched/updated, with Office365 and little else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp; Appreciate any pointers anyone can offer.</p>

            Its likely because its in use.
<br />
<br />Try rebooting into safe mode then delete it.

<br />Or boot into the recovery environment then boot it from the command prompt.

<p>I have the same issue as the OP.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I found some information on here that explained it was caused by a bad update, and I carried out steps in Admin Powershell&nbsp; that cleared it (I can remember it involved closing "TrustedInstaller.exe" and then deleting the files)&nbsp; - today it is back
 again and my SSD is full (this cannot be doing my SSD much good).<br />
<br />
I tried your suggestion, but it appears to have done nothing<br />
The only response it gave me was:<br />
</p>
<p>"Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
Version 10.0.16299.15</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image Version&nbsp; 10.0.16299.15"</p>
<p><br />
My CBS Log is currently 126 GB, size on disk 71.6 GB, and I don't know what to do with it, please help.<br />
<br />

<p>To provide as much background information as I can on this:<br />
</p>
<p>Initially my problem was my "Windows Installer" was refusing to work, I tried every suggestion regarding Windows Installer not working, https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-installer-service-could-not-be-accessed/8e9cd803-14dd-493b-8e8a-588767ca1530?auth=1&amp;rtAction=1513165868548#
</p>
<p>none of which fixed it, several of which (such as switching it on and off in services) only gave "The installer's not working" type errors.<br />
<br />
<strong>Eventually, to resolve that, I had to perform a fresh install of Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 reinstall, one of my updates:</p>
<p><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054517/windows-10-update-kb4054517
</span>kept stopping at 99%,&nbsp; </p>
<p>A message in the failed update notification message lead me to the workaround detailed there, I carried out the actions as instructed.&nbsp; Following those actions, my Windows updater finally cleared the fact that it kept thinking the update was failing at 99%<br />
</p>
<p>Now however, Windows updater is giving me the same "Last failed install attempt on ‎27/‎12/‎2017 - 0x800706be"&nbsp; message that I was getting before I carried out the fix, and is convinced the update failed at 99% again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'd known I was going to have this much trouble, I would have written down every thing that has happened since my initial "Installer not working" issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So currently:<br />
<br />
I have an update that was supposed to have installed okay, and has now returned to saying it's failed.<br />
<br />
I have a CBS.log that clears itself every time I reboot, and then within 6 hours totally fills my 250GB SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what's causing this, or how to fix it, and<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I really need some help.</span></p>

    <title>How to size and place programs to stay in place next time you open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> humblebears  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to size and place programs to stay in place next time you open them</h2>
                    <p>Hello, it would be quite helpful if I could learn how to keep/save my programs in the size that I make them and also in the same location where I place them on the screen so that next time I turn on the computer and open everything up, they open up in the
 desired place and are the desired size .. if that makes sense. I am running Windows 10 and have half a dozen programs that I use each day and it would be great if I didn't have to size them and place them how I like them every morning and if they could just
 remember how I like them to be!</p>
<p>P.S I did Google this and tried the "hold ctrl button and press X to close" technique, but it didn't work, as the next time I opened these, I had to resize, replace as usual.</p>
<p>I am very, very grateful for the correct answer, it may only save me two minutes each morning, but I would prefer to use those two minutes on actual work rather than this little task. Many thanks.</p>

            HI HB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Place the Window in the size and position where you want it, then click the middle Maximize button (between the - minimize and X close buttons) at top right of WIndow a few times to see if it will recognize that position and then reopen there after you close it.  
<br />
<br />This is the way to train Windows to open where you want them.  If it won't work then it's often because of another program conflicting.  There are small apps like AutoSizer that you can install to do this for you, which run from the System Tray with WIndows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks for your time in replying, I downloaded the program but don't exactly know how to use it. I guessed that I need to select "resize/reposition" from the dropdown but when I closed the program and reopened it hadn't saved. Are there instructions for
 this? Or is there another solution. I'm so peeved after spending 2 hours with MS chat support staff and in the end they said there is no solution, it's simply a functionality that isn't available with Windows 10. In this day and age I would have thought that
 there must be some way .. it ain't rocket science.&nbsp; Please post again if you can help further, thank you.

<h2>            Xbox 360S E68 issue with two different hard drives.</h2>
                    
<p>Have a 3 week old Xbox 360 Slim 4GB Kinect bundle.</p>
<p>Realised that 4G is just not big enough. D'oh, but I prefer matt black to shiny black.</p>
<p>I bought a genuine 320G hard drive for it. Put it in, and I get an E68 on screen.</p>
<p>I think it must be a faulty hard drive, so I send it back and get another one.</p>
<p>New genuine 320G hard drive arrives, put it in and the same E68 is up on screen!</p>
<p>Xbox works fine without a hard drive in it.</p>
<p>Any ideas? I am guessing that something might be loose inside the Xbox if two different hard drives give the same E68.</p>
<p>I really dont want to have to send this Xbox in as I wont have it over Christmas. Annoyed :(</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, an E68 error code is a hardware problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both of the new hard drives had the same problem - it is more than likely the console needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though it may work without the drive - it could still point to an defective drive interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup#990c712a9b64469ea377d7373a76d968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi, try giving the hard drive connector in the consoles hard drive bay&nbsp;a good blow with compressed air preferably, it may just be dust build up on the connector with you not using it before.</p>

<p>I took the console back to GAME today as it was just inside the 28 day period. They connected it up in store, it worked perfectly with a store 320G drive so i bought that drive. It was installed in the console at the store, and I took it home again. Guess
 what - error 68 again with a THIRD hard drive. I don't understand this at all. GAME wont exchange it unless there is a problem that shows up in store.</p>
<p>The power supply from my box was used in store, there were no differences in peripherals.</p>
<p>Any ideas what could be causing this?</p>

<p>Is your power supply connected directly to the main power outlet, not through a surge protector or extension lead of some sort. If that isn't the case try another power outlet to see if that helps any.</p>
- If you have any other external USB devices connected to the console try removing those as well.

<p>Checked that possibility too. I created a test rig in another area of the house. One TV and one console, no USB cables connected at all. Just HDMI. Power for TV and Power for console in their own mains sockets. Am seeing a consistent 239V coming out the
 wall plugs. Still happens?!?</p>

<p>Did you try it twice in the store, both times with their HDD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entirely possible it works once, but not twice. The drive becomes corrupted after the first boot and won't work afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of is holding down the console sync button while booting, and keep holding it until the Dashboard appears.</p>

<div>Those are three <span>
authentication technologies</span> for networking.<br />
<br />
LEAP <span>Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol</span>, developed by Cisco, it allows for rotating WEP keys for wireless encryption, it's based on MS-CHAP authentication by
<span>Microsoft</span>. This is outdated and should not be used unless necessary.<br />
<br />
PEAP is a joint venture between Microsoft, Cisco, and RSA for secure TLS tunneling with PKI certificates as authentication.<br />
<br />
EAP FAST is the new version of LEAP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are most likely part of your wireless package. If you do not use wireless, you can remove them."</div>

<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:

The <b>sfc /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.

<p>Hi Danyscarface,</p>
<p>Like BobMcFly said, you will need to call Xbox customer support, and they will have to put in a ticket to have this issue escalated. Be patient, as this will be a lengthy resolution.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Ok, gonna keep it simple.</p>
<p>XxXEl1texSn1p3sXxX -------- cooldude38746 ----------- poormanrug --------- slimpayload ---------- contumacious (yes thats a real word)</p>
<p>NONE of the above listed names has ever and will NEVER be considered an "ORIGINAL GAMERTAG"&nbsp;</p>
<p>People don't seem to understand that OG stands for someone who basically has been there from the beginning. Not someone who joins 10 years after conception.</p>
<p>Point being, just make your name what is easy for you to remember, and something that people won't be tempted to harass you about. But if you are daring I have ONE suggestion.</p>
<p>1. If you want an OG name and don't wanna be a doucher and buy it from someone….</p>
<p>Pick something short like the word "GORE" …. ok? Now watch this.</p>
<p>g0hr ------ GAMERTAG AVAILABLE&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Wellllllllllll whaddya know boys and girls I found an OG(ish) gamer tag in about a second…. NOT HARD</span></p>
<p><span>Just think about how to play with a word that "speaks" to you and your gaming personality. But beware, when you carry a name like this, often you will be targeted by the other players in the game because everyone wants to kill
 the guy with the "cool name". One number is acceptable to use in a OG tag in my opinion at least, and that number is 0. Don't use 1 or 3 or 7….. stupid!</span></p>
<p><span>Take it from me kiddos… I was a beta tester for Xbox Live in 2002… and I hung up my hat in 2005. And recently picked up an Xbox One and got back into it at the age of 26. And how long did it take me to find a **** OG gamer
 tag? Hmmm, 2 minutes I believe. haha </span></p>

<p><span>THEY ARE OUT THERE. JUST THINK AND YOU SHALL BE REWARDED WITH A SWEET NAME.</span></p>
<p><span>(i don't know why I'm doing this but here's some gamer tags that are CURRENTLY AVAILABLE as of Jan. 1, 2014:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>f0hr</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>g0hr</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>bl0h</span></strong><br />

<strong><span>sn0h</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>gl0hs</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>h0hz</span></strong><br />
<span>…… I could go on and on people…. c'mon get with it<strong> use that brain!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Metro apps broke, their interface is a mess - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amat3ur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Metro apps broke, their interface is a mess</h2>
                    <p>Something very weird happened to most of my Microsoft Modern UI apps. Their interface became a real mess, making them almost unusable. I did not install anything nor did I mess with some system settings. They all worked fine, and after a reboot they all
 broke down. The issue affects apps like Mail, Calendar, Skype, People, Music, Video, Bing News, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 3rd party apps like Facebook, Twitter, NextGen Reader, etc work fine. Core Modern system apps (OneDrive, Internet Explorer) also work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro (1st gen), Windows 8.1 Pro (Polish language). Everything is up to date, both firmware and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling those apps does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... please help me.&nbsp; :-) The only thing I can think of is reinstalling the whole system, but I really don't want to do that (lot of software to reinstall, I really want to avoid that...) and besides I have no guarantee that this will fix everything permanently.
 Sample screenshots below. I'll gladly provide additional info, whatever is needed.</p>

            <p>Windows has a number of recovery features to get "back up and running" quickly after a problem occurs. Some of these recovery features are more impactful than others, to be sure to read the impacts carefully.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option One: System Restore</strong> (Safest, try this first)<br />
If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files. It only takes a couple minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn't
 fix the problem on the first try. When you aren't sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.</li></ul>

<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore, or try another date.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 2: Create a new profile</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Because profiles are separated from each other and the system, creating a new profile on your computer can help troubleshoot and resolve issues. Many times an issue in a profile can be resolved by creating a new one. It takes a little time to set up
 your preferences and drag your files to the new profile, but it can save many hours of headache. As with the System Restore, this is a "safe option", because no files will be lost if you try this.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Accounts, Other Accounts, and then Add An Account.</li><li>When adding the account, choose "Sign in without a Microsoft Account" and create a Local Account.</li><li>Login to the new account and see if the issue is fixed. If so, you can open the C:\Users folder and drag your files into the new profile.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 3: PC Refresh </strong>(keep your files, but reinstall Windows)<strong><br />
</strong>If your PC&nbsp; isn't performing&nbsp; as well as it once did, and you don't know why, you can refresh your PC without deleting any of your personal files or changing your settings. All your personal files and settings will be kept, but any programs you installed
 yourself from CD's or websites (like Firefox, Office, games, etc) will be removed and you'll have to download them again on your own.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Update and Recovery, then choose "Get Started" for the refresh.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 4: PC Reset</strong> (a full factory reset -- everything will be removed)<strong><br />
</strong>If you want to recycle your PC, give it away, or start over with it, you can reset&nbsp;&nbsp; it completely.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Update and Recovery, then choose "Get Started" for the reset.</li></ol>
</ol>

            <p>I know about all of these. And providing additional info: issue is not limited to single user profile. It happens on all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to do restore/refresh/reinstall as a last resort option, because reinstalling a lot of classic Desktop apps that I am using will be probably a whole day's work and it doesn't give me any guarantee that the issue will not come back. I prefer to fix
 this particular problem than reinstall blindly whole operating system.</p>

            My colleague Anand Khanse has some troubleshooting on his site.&nbsp; However I'm not sure if it will apply to this situation (to be honest I've never seen that type of corruption as in your screenshots, that's a new one).&nbsp; But here's the steps to try:

            <p>Thanks for the hint. I've tried did but it did not work. But not because the soulution is wrong (it probably is, because it fixes a different issue), but because the script is not working (I did everything exactly as described, but looks like the script
 is broken):</p>

<p>You can't. The CC and BCC lines appear in the head of the message when enabled, below the
