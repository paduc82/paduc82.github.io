            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker, their on-line documentation and any forums.<br />
<br />
800x600 &amp;&nbsp;1024x768 are 4/3 - and some other resolutions might give reasonable appearance<br />
depending on what you are running and size/dimensions of screen.<br />
<br />
Right Click Destop - Graphics Properties <br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
Right Click Desktop - Personalize - Display Settings<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Missed conversations in outlook and sender cid-&#40;XXXXX&#41;&#64;outlook.com</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have two issues with Skype for business on Windows 10 build&nbsp;10.0.16299 and office 365 build 8431.2153.<br />
<br />
The fist issue is that I receive missed conversations and instead of the username or email address it shows as&nbsp;cid-(XXXXX)@outlook.com.<br />
<br />
The second issue is that I receive missed conversations even if I'm at my desk with the skype conversation open.<br />
The message will not show in the SFB client, only in the email.<br />
<br />
Here is an example, disregard the timestamps, I have read that MS is aware of the issue.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b5bdd8c-35cb-4c68-a806-2dec1428d1e1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b5bdd8c-35cb-4c68-a806-2dec1428d1e1?upload=true" /><br />
</a><br />
I have disabled the setting to save conversation history and we are on a hybrid environment with no lync server.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need any more information.

<p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. I know your current situation now. Based on my experience, there may be a problem with the Skype accounts without Microsoft account association. You can create a new contact, type "cid..." value into email as a workaround. Also, it's recommend that you
 vote for this feature via this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/15540255-return-of-traditional-skypeid-instead-of-cid-xxx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/15540255-return-of-traditional-skypeid-instead-of-cid-xxx</a>.
 Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description that you have provided, I understand that you have used a third party program to perform disk partition. If this issue occurred due to the EASEUS partition Manager, then it would be better to contact them for further assistance
 with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. Did you format the drive or shrink the volume?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to fix the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you do not have an Installation Media, you may try to create one from a different Windows 8.1 disk and then try the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to create an Installation Media.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after creating an Installation Media, I would suggest you to perform System Restore to restore the computer to a date before you performed disk partition and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to perform system restore using the Installation Media:</p>
<p>a. Insert the Installation&nbsp;Media such as (DVD or flash drive) and press F12 key and click on
<strong>c</strong><strong>hange default or other options </strong>which is at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>b. In the next screen click on <strong>troubleshoot option</strong>, this will display you different WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment) options to resolve issues with the computer when it is in no boot state.</p>
<p>c. Now Click on <strong>System Restore</strong>, this will open up a Wizard and restore to a point when the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>Hi Masood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've already made recoverable disks you can use them to solve the above said error,</p>
<p>Or else : ( <strong>I'm assuming your laptop came with preinstalled win8.1 </strong>
(serial key will be in BIOS for preinstalled versions) &nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1 : You can overcome that mess using <strong>EasyRE Neosmart</strong>,</p>
<p>But <strong>OKR will not work</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2 : If you have <strong>windows 8 copy install it</strong>,You can use win8 but you do not have a vaild key so you need to download&nbsp;<strong>KB 2919355</strong> manually and install it which is&nbsp;<strong>prerequisites for win8.1 update</strong> (Easy way to
 update from win 8 to win 8.1) Then in store you can find the update,Run the update wait for it to install (Serial Key will be automatically detected).You can install OKR manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 : Most of the laptops comes with Preinstalled <strong>Win 8.1 core single language</strong> version,</p>
<p>You need to get this copy and install it (Serial Key will be automatically detected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above steps helps to solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards.</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Energy options Allow wake timers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsaxobeat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Energy options Allow wake timers</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone know, why on the surface book 2 the option "Allow wake timers" is missing in the "Power Options", "Advanced Settings" , "Sleep" section?</p>
<p>Or does someone know how to make this option visible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my surface book 2 I have tasks in the task scheduler (really simple tasks calling a local batch file, no network etc.) that are never executed at the scheduled time. These are executed a few hours later or when I manually wake up the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know it is essential to enable the "allow wake timers" option to enable the task scheduler to wake up the PC from sleep mode.</p>
<p>Can someone confirm this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone managed to do this on the surface book 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The same task scheduler setup works without problem on a Lenovo Notebook (where I have the "allow wake timer" enable option) and tasks do happen at the time when they are scheduled.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mrsaxobeat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting us here in Microsoft Community! </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Allow wake timers" is not enabled by default on the Surface device because of the&nbsp;Modern Standby (previously Connected Standby). In Modern Standby, the PC uses the S0 low power idle model which has the flexibility to configure the default behavior to limit
 network activity while in the low power state. Windows&nbsp;10 reduces power consumption by the OS and only wakes from the lowest power state when absolutely necessary. With Modern Standby, the system wakes when there is real time action required, such as OS maintenance,
 or a user wakes the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we will look into this further and check for an option for you to possibly enable it. For the meantime, please provide us with the operating system, Version and OS build of the Windows running on both your Surface Book 2 and Lenovo Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for the operating system information in Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select the
<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong> button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;
<strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>
About</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Under
<strong>Device specifications</strong>, you can see if you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.
</span></span></span></span></span></li><li>Under <strong>
Windows specifications</strong>, you can find out which edition and version of Windows your device is running.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks for your replies !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally posted this in the german microsoft surface forum, but only few people seem to read the posts there and there are usually no replies...</p>
<p>So thumbs up for the english/us forum üëç</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the OS Versions and registry on both machines an they are exactly the same for the Surface Book 2 and the Lenovo ThinkPad T530:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit Version<br />
Version: 1809<br />
OS-Build: 17763.316<br />
Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\CSEnabled = 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that Connected Standby is also enabled on the Lenovo and there I see the "Allow wake timers" option in the advanced energy settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like the idea of doing registry tweaks because</p>
<p>a) Microsoft might not support me any more if I do that and</p>
<p>b) The tweaks are usually gone when you do a Windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be necessary to do Registry Tweaks to make the task scheduler function properly.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary on other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone managed to wake up the Surface Book 2 from sleep via a time scheduled task scheduler job at the scheduled time? Or am I the first one trying to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone maybe do the same test on his/her Surface Book 2 like I did: </p>
<p>Set up a task in the taskscheduler that executes a .bat script that prints date and time into a .txt file at 2:00 at every night? That would be great.</p>
<p>The .bat script does look like this:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">date /T &gt;&gt; outfile.txt<br />
time /T &gt;&gt; outfile.txt</span>This enables me to see when the task was actually executed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>Hello Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>I tried that one 2 weeks ago and did it again last night just to make sure I haven't made a mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tweak makes the "Allow wake timer" option visible in the advanced energy options but it does not lead to successful execution of the task scheduler task at the scheduled time. So unfortunately it does not help :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, the "Allow wake timer" option disappeared again when updated to the latest Windows build...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have given up on Microsoft support. Spent hours with the telephone support explaining the problem to a dozen of people (sometimes after explaining what the windiws task scheduler is), wrote emails to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, used the Feedback Hub.
</p>
<p>Worst support experience ever ! They just close support cases without giving you a chance for feedback.</p>
<p>It is like you want to get into the Microsoft castle and they are throwing rocks and boiling oil on you.</p>
<p>Seems they are not very interested to help their customers.</p>
<p>It would be a chance to prove that their products (which are not the chespest ones) do support their own OS Windows 10 as good as other far cheaper products on the market. But they don't want to.</p>
<p>So maybe this comment can help others to make the right decision when it comes to buying microsoft products or the ones of other manufacturers. For me the decision is made.&nbsp;

<p>After many many calls with Microsoft support and many hours of phone waiting music I finally got in contact with a support person with in depth knowldege.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer:</p>
<p>The surface book 2 does (only) support the new "Modern Standby" Energy management. Wake-Up is only possible by pressing the ON-key or by an external server which pushes software updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wake-Up by the Task scheduler (wake timer): Not possible</p>
<p>Wake-Up by Wake-On-LAN: Not possible</p>
<p>Wake-Up by something on the USB-Port: Not possibel</p>
<p>Wake-Up by disconnecting/connecting power: Not possible</p>
<p>Disable Modern Standby: Not possible</p>
<br />
<p>The only thing you can do to make sure that scheduled tasks are executed at the time they are scheduled is to leave the surface book on and disable all Energy saving modes.<br />
</p>
<p>Great! A 1200$ Microsoft-Windows-PC which das not support the functionality forseen by the Microsoft Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>
Thank you Microsoft!</p>

    <title>Create a script to automate copying a file based on resolution. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j rizzil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a script to automate copying a file based on resolution.</h2>
                    <p>I am new to creating scripts so I thought I would throw this out there to see if anyone can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom image that I would like to set the windows 7 lock screen to. This does not scale so I would like to detect if the machine is connected to a widescreen or fullscreen monitor and have the script copy the appropriate file over automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a .bat that I can achieve this through user interaction, but I am wondering if there is a way to automate it without any interaction.</p>
<p>Here is the one with the user prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>@echo off</em></p>
<p><em>echo Adding Registry Key for customized login screen wallpaper</em><br />
<em>regedit.exe /s C:\Utilities\OEMBackground.reg</em></p>
<p><em>echo.</em></p>
<p><em>echo Creating folders for wallpaper to be saved in</em><br />
<em>MD C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info</em><br />
<em>MD C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds</em><br />
<em>echo.</em><br />
<em>echo Adding Login Screen Wallpaper</em><br />
<em>echo.</em><br />
<em>set /p x=Is this a Widescreen monitor?[Y/N]</em><br />
<em>if /i "%x%" == "Y" goto Yes</em><br />
<em>if /i "%x%" == "N" goto No</em><br />
<br />
<em>:Yes</em><br />
<em>echo Copying login screen background for widescreen monitors</em><br />
<em>xcopy "C:\Wallpapers\Widescreen\backgroundDefault.jpg" C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds</em><br />
<em>exit</em><br />
<br />
<em>:No</em><br />
<em>echo Copying login screen background for fullscreen monitors</em><br />
<em>xcopy "C:\Wallpapers\Fullscreen\backgroundDefault.jpg" C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds</em><br />
<em>exit</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have been able to detect the resolution with this WMIC command "<em>wmic desktopmonitor get screenheight, screenwidth"&nbsp;</em>Is there any way to implement the information pulled from this command to automatically achieve what I am trying to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            the fix for this is to turn off night light and install f.lux, since microsoft cant seem to be bothered with with fixing this.

<p>It is not possible to copy and paste text from WMP but if you want to know the
<strong>total number of songs</strong> you can simply select <strong>'Music - Play All'
</strong>and you should see the it at the foot of the now playing list when you scroll down - (I have never used Vista but that is what I see in W7 and W10). - R.</p>

<p>I'm not using vista. I have windows 10. That's what I've been using since it came out. I went straight from xp to 10. I never had any vista or any other versions. Only xp &amp; then straight to 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have itunes.&nbsp; I have to buy music from itunes &amp; then copy &amp; paste in to windows media. Itunes gives me check boxes unlike windows media. Itunes won't let me delete ONLY from library. It only deletes from computer too unlike windows media it asks if
 you want it deleted from library only or deleted from computer too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems I'm saving when I add to playlist but I want to be sure. When I drag the music over to the pane &amp; it says how many files &amp; how many hours it makes it like it's a new playlist &amp; then I name it the same as the one I already have &amp; it asks if I want
 to do an overwrite. Then it comes up &amp; says I can't because it's being playing right now although I'm not playing any music.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK - you&nbsp;originally posted in the Vista forum (see below 'question info' upper right) hence the query... I have just requested your Q is relocated accordingly... I have iTunes on W10 as my default player mainly because I have an Apple compatible streaming
 amp. I think your iTunes set-up may be a bit awry because you should not need to copy/paste items to go to WMP.</p>
<p>I don't buy items from iTunes but it is possible to delete&nbsp;only from the library with other files so perhaps your settings and folder structure need reviewing. Where is your iTunes media folder located at present?</p>

<p>C drive Program Files\iTunes</p>
<p>Where do you buy your music?&nbsp; I heard that on the other sites if you're paying a monthly fee - once you stop - you can't access that music anymore unlike itunes that you buy song/album - it's yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent 2 days ripping music from cd's &amp; I'm worried that once I try to put on mp3 it'll say it's not able too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus like I said it seems like I saved in windows media but when I drag to see how many songs I have &amp; it comes up new playlist &amp; save &amp; I go to save &amp; save under the same name &amp; do an overwrite - it won't let me. If I change the name it won't. Either way
 it'll say you're music is still playing although it's not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on the phone with itunes the other day for 1.5 hours just to get songs in my library to play. Some would &amp; some wouldn't. It kept saying I had to agree to terms although some would play. It wouldn't let me click on agree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have over 100 songs on itunes but some are doubles. That's a lot of work to go through each double to delete. I wanted to delete whole library &amp; then then put windows music back in. Windows media doesn't give you the option for click boxes. Only when ripping.
 Not when add to mp3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I posted question I didn't see the vista. I just said post a question. I see it now &amp; it doesn't give me the option to switch to 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi - sorry I didn't pick up your reply yesterday. Don't worry about posting in the wrong place... this site isn't the best for user-friendliness! It's just we need to be sure what we're dealing with hence my initial query. Your post is in the right section
 now (partly why I missed the reply!)</p>
<p>I subscribe to Spotify premium and you are right that you can download content but not for keeps, so if you end or downgrade the subscription you lose those downloads (and they cannot be copied to disc).</p>
<p>However for the cost of a mid-price CD per month I can access all the music I could ever want as well as uploading my own files if they are not on the Spotify platform, so I doubt I shall ever cancel (except if they hit me with an outrageous price hike!)</p>
<p>You omitted to mention the present location of your iTunes folder. Duplicates can arise because iTunes is not set up correctly. Also did you look at the youtube video for hints on playlists? I realize it's for W8.1 but that has the same version of WMP....
 Cheers, R.</p>

<p>Hi - sorry I didn't&nbsp;spot the location because it is not where iTunes Media should be... only the program files should be in that folder. The Media folder should be in the main music folder by default as shown below... it may be that the duplication is occurring
 as a result. How long have you been using iTunes? It may be worth uninstalling and reinstalling the program but if you want to try, use this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a></strong> for how to do&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;because if not&nbsp;carried

<h2>            Extremely disappointed with Microsoft quality, Microsoft customer service &#38; the Microsoft Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>I was one of the people who bought in to the Surface Book hype &amp; ordered one almost immediately after seeing the unveiling.&nbsp; I work in visual effects, motion graphics &amp; commercial film and it was exciting to finally have a device that would equal what Apple
 puts out in terms of quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book eventually started to develop the rainbow staining along the edges of the screen due to the graphics chips overheating.&nbsp; Now, my entire screen has developed a bow to it &amp; in the middle is actually bulging out.&nbsp; The first thing that comes
 to mind for me is, exploding cell phones &amp; HP battery fires.&nbsp; Lithium batteries bulge before they catch on fire or explode &amp; this sure does look similar to that type of situation.&nbsp; But, my warranty has expired and as far as I can tell from MS support, the
 only option I have is to pay $79 to just have them answer my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize when something is out of warranty, that's it.&nbsp; But when I compare how MS handles things to how Apple handled things when my iPhone had an issue out of warranty, it's night and day.&nbsp; When I contacted Apple support, they barely questioned me - but
 when they determined the issue they simply asked if I could wait a week for a replacement or if I'd be ok with paying $12 for a replacement phone to be sent to me overnight.&nbsp; It was refurbished, but it meant I'd be back up and running in under 12 hours.&nbsp; Even
 though the phone was no longer under warranty, they took care of it immediately.&nbsp; So guess who has a very long-term customer?&nbsp; Guess who recommends their product to everyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But MS, guess who has told every artist, designer, animator, etc., to avoid the Surface line?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Book isn't cheap.&nbsp; For what I paid, I expected better quality and a much longer life.&nbsp; I have an ancient 24" HP laptop that's a big creaky pile of plastic, but it still works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS wants to gain an Apple-like following, they have to start giving Apple-like customer service to people who pay a premium for devices like the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Paul</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a bulging screen which doesn¬¥t sound very good, I would recommend you to contact MS Support customer service so you can get your device exchanged (even though it¬¥s out of warranty) since a bulging screen can be dangerous. This is special circumstances
 and they will help you from what I¬¥ve experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft don¬¥t want any of their devices to explode.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So contact them by Chat (24/7 live support) which you don¬¥t have to pay for to get support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>

<p>I have a similar issue as Paul, the battery bulging has caused the screen to pop out of the housing and now i have 1 side of the screen that exposes the inside of the surface book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've tried contacting your support, they said they took down all the details and said will get back to me within 48 hours but it's been 6 days. i assume that will be more than 48 hours...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reside overseas and out of north america now and i am just sad that i cannot get any support just because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please let me know what i can do to resolve my problem...</p>

<p>
</p><p>as for contacting your 24/7 chat, i've been on the phone for almost 2hours now, and no one picked up the phone. Yes, i am currently on the phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>i called the contact number that was shown for Thailand +6622636888, navigated the menu to the tech support for surface hardware and now i'm still listening to the same "upbeat" music for the last 2 hours.</p>

            You need to find someone in the country where you purchased the Surface from to initiate the support request. Then you need to ship your Surface to that person and have them handle the exchange with Microsoft.

<p>I have the exact same problems.&nbsp; The screen is delaminating.&nbsp; The screen and frame itself is bowing and bulging. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no Microsoft Store near me.&nbsp; I have contacted MS and they did not offer any help or solutions.&nbsp; The only thing I was offered was the chance to go buy a new computer at full price.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now find myself working as a professor at a local university teaching digital media arts classes.&nbsp; The Surface Book would have been my recommendation for all students and for the school a few years ago.&nbsp; Now, there is no way on earth I would recommend
 anyone buy a Microsoft product. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The front of my Surface Book's screen is puffed out like a balloon full of air. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really can't believe MS's support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose if it explodes or burns down my house or office, Microsoft might finally pay attention.&nbsp; That's what it took for Samsung with the Galaxy phones....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error <span>0x80073cfe that started after the latest Windows update may occur in Windows Store due to corrupted package repository. For us to fix this error, we suggest that you reset the Windows Store cache and try installing apps again. To reset the Windows
 Store cache, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run </strong>window.</li><li>Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop with the result.</p>

            I've tried that again ... and I tried it before.&nbsp; So did Microsoft support, but to no avail.&nbsp; Also, there is no feedback response when I execute that command wsreset.exe&nbsp; (should there be?)<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>What was the feedback response? After performing the command, Windows Store and Command Prompt will open without any messages. It will also close once the Windows Store cache has been reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, since you still can't install any apps from Windows Store, it is better to rebuild Windows Store using Windows PowerShell to repair broken components in it. Follow these steps on how to:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Cortana </strong>search box, type <strong>windows powershell</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> from the list and select <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type this command and press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard: <strong>
Get-AppxPackage | % { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppxManifest.xml" -verbose }</strong></li><li>Restart your computer and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>

    <title>External Monitors and Ethernet connection--Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stre solutions  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Monitors and Ethernet connection--Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Any ideas on next steps?&nbsp; I'm in finger pointing "*ell...".&nbsp; My 1 year old Dell XPS12 ultrabook won't work with external monitors through a port replicator on Windows 10.&nbsp; It works intermittently and it's too late to roll back to windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried
 3 different port replicators and none work.&nbsp; Support from Microsoft got both the internet and monitors to work on Monday but after turning off the computer overnight and then reconnecting Tuesday morning the external monitors and the ethernet connection don't
 work again.&nbsp; Microsoft wasn't helpful on Tuesday or Wednesay and said it's not their problem, it's a graphics card issue, but that doesn't explain the ethernet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dell can't fix it.&nbsp; Microsoft says it's a graphics card issue, not theirs, and DisplayLink
 drivers don't help.&nbsp;But it's not just an external monitor or graphics card issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how or where to escalate this issue would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Otherwise I assume I have to buy a new computer, and that doesn't make me happy.</p>

    <title>Print Wizard Contact Sheet Problem displaying Filenames - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barbarac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Wizard Contact Sheet Problem displaying Filenames</h2>
                    In Windows XP, I could select a group of images and print a contact sheet via the Photo Printing Wizard.&nbsp; The filenames were centered under the image, and WRAPPED when the filename was long.<br />
<br />
In Windows Vista, all of the above works EXCEPT that the filenames are centered and TRUNCATED.&nbsp; This is not the desired behavior.&nbsp; Is there a fix, or workaround, or alternative?&nbsp; (Besides copying the files back to an XP machine?)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            Hello BarbaraC,<br />
<br />
Try the following link to see if this will allow you to view full file-names without truncating them.&nbsp; I don't think that the result you're looking for in Vista can be achieved.&nbsp; Everything I have read indicates that Microsoft truncates the file-names to fit
 under the thumbnail.<br />

<h2>            Error 0x800701E3 Problem</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've been trying to install things on steam and getting an error when attempting to install them onto my brand new 2TB Drive (Drive D:). Eventually when I was attempting to make a new folder for pictures on my 2TB Drive, I got error 0x800701E3:
 The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error. I also realized all the games I had installed onto that drive have disappeared since it cannot find the drive (I guess.)<br />
<br />
The drive was originally bought/installed 2-4 months ago. I Originally realized the error around 1 week ago, Not noticing it was a problem with my drive at the time.<br />
Can someone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8/4/2018<br />
After replying to Eric Ber, I also added that the drive has gone missing from my computer and is no longer listed as a drive to use. Please send me new updates to fix THIS problem alongside the drive not working.</p>

<p>Hi TheRubyChest,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code, 0x800701E3, may occur if the hard drive is failing. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the Windows key, type winver, and press the Enter key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li><li>Can you try to connect the hard drive to a different computer and check if it happens there?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the drive was originally bought 2 to 4 months ago, I would suggest that you contact the store where you purchased the drive so you can request for a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward to your reply.</p>

                    Dear MS, PLEASE PLEASE Add a button in Windows 10 to be able to control when we want it to search for and download updates. Im so freakin pissed that you folks took out this option, We can only afford DSL where we live and Ive wasted countless hours to
 get my business going while 10 takes up all the bandwidth with downloads. I cant believe I allowed you to suck us in to a new OS that slows us down so much and is cooking my HP laptop on top of it.&nbsp; If these are'nt addressed soon, we are switching over to

            <p>‚ÄãHi,</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Do you face the issue only when you are working on a specific program? </li><li>What is the make and model of the mouse?</li><li>Do you recall any changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
 If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean
 boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After troubleshooting, make
 sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 from the above provided KB article.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>

            Hi gggz,
<br />
<br />My name is Roger W, an independent advisor trying to help. Let's try with the following suggestions, please:
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Adobe Reader and click on Edit option available on the menu.
<br />
<br />Click on the Preference in the Edit menu.
<br />
<br />Select Security Enhances under ‚ÄòCategories‚Äô  in the new Preference window.
<br />
<br />Disable  the ‚ÄúProtected Mode at startup‚Äù by unticking the box under the Sandbox Protection
<br />
<br />Adobe Reader not working in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Check the ‚ÄúEnable Enhanced Security ‚Äù option and Close
<br />
<br />
<br />Let us know if the solution above works for you.

            <p>I had this issue on Windows 10. Downloading and installing the Microsoft Core XML Services x86 version fixed my issue.</p>
<p>Ensure you use the x86 version as the Dymo print utility seems to still call win32 process (My computer has the 64bit version of windows)</p>
