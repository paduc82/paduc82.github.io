    <title>Is my XBox console new&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is my XBox console new&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got an XBox One X Metro Exodus bundle yesterday. There are two packing tapes on the outer bundle box, one in each side but the packing tape on the inside box was cut open. I am not sure if there was any issue or it was a return piece that was sold to me.
 I got it from Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The console looked new and the codes for the games were not used. When setting up, I saw few flickering shots on the sceen but that went away after few seconds. I did not yet play any games on the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The consile was setup and I did register the console to check on the warrenty which was given as 8/4/2020. I thought the warrenty was only for an year and should have been valid only till 3/12/2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>Hello Umak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. You can register the device and check the warranty on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a>. Warranty starts the day you purchased it and you get 1 year. If the warranty is anything other than that you can request a call from support to file a warranty dispute, this will adjust the warranty to your purchase date.</p>

            Sounds like when you purchased the Xbox One X there were seal stickers on the sides. As long as these seals do not appear to be tampered with and the bundle did not specifically say refurbished, I would expect your console was new. The flickering shots
 you mentioned were likely the initial setup process for picture formatting. You've also mentioned you were able to register the console and were given a warranty date. All seems well to me! Congrats on the purchase and enjoy!<br />

            Hi James Giovannini,
<br />
<br />I would like to share one thing that if you want to setup OneDrive on External Hard Drive the External HDD should be connected to the Computer because if you disconnect and again connect it to the computer , it will prompt you to again setup OneDrive where you initially did the setup. Because to sync OneDrive you cannot have the both locations,as i hope you knew that the location or path can be one only.
<br />
<br />For further details, I would suggest you to read the below mentioned article, I am hopeful you will get it.
<br />

<p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>Extracts from a Windows support page:<br />
</p>
<p>You can make the text (and other things like icons) larger without changing the screen resolution of your monitor or laptop screen. That way, you can make text easier to see and still keep your monitor or laptop set to the best possible resolution.</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Screen Resolution by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<span>Search</span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<span>Search</span>), entering <span>Display</span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking <span>Display</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Smaller - 100% (default)</span>. This keeps text and other items at normal size.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Medium - 125%</span>. This sets text and other items to 125% of normal size.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Larger - 150%</span>. This sets text and other items to 150% of normal size. This option appears only if your monitor supports a resolution of at least 1200 x 900 pixels.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Apply</span>. </p>
<p>To see the new text size, close all of your apps, and then sign out of <span>Windows</span>. The change will take effect the next time you sign in.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Also, you can change the text size for specific items in <span>Windows</span>, like window title bars or tooltips, without changing the size of anything else on the screen.
</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Screen Resolution by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<span>Search</span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<span>Search</span>), entering <span>Display</span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking <span>Display</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>Change only the text size</span>, choose the item you'd like to change and pick a text size. If you want the text to be bold, select the
<span>Bold</span> check box. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Apply</span>. </p>
<p>You'll see the change the next time you sign in to <span>Windows</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>You can also make text appear larger or smaller by changing your screen resolution, but if you're using an LCD monitor or laptop, it's a good idea to set your screen to its native resolution to avoid blurry text. This is the resolution that a monitor or
 laptop screen was designed to display based on its size. For more info, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get the best display on your monitor</a>. </p>
<p>If you have a 1080p touchscreen device, you might need to adjust the size of the items on your screen to make sure touch works correctly. By default, some 1080p touchscreen devices show text and other items at 150%, and some of your apps might not work at
 that size. To fix the problem, follow these steps:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Screen Resolution by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<span>Search</span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<span>Search</span>), entering <span>Display</span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking <span>Display</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Smaller - 100% (default)</span>. Then tap or click <span>Apply</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>To see the new text size, close all of your apps, and then sign out of <span>Windows</span>. The change will take effect the next time you sign in.
</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can't change the default font or font color used for items in <span>Windows</span> (like window title bars, menus, or tooltips). But you can change the color of your window borders and taskbar, or use a High Contrast Theme to make the items on your screen
 easier to see. For more info, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/get-started-with-themes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>So you bought the console in Quebec but now the console is in Columbia? Or are you still in Canada? IF you are in Columbia then you should be able to change your region from your Account on xbox.com. Just select My Account in the upper right hand corner
 under your gamertag and you can change Region to any available region from the selections. Also, bare in mind some content may not be available in one region when purchased in another.</p>

<h2>            problems communicating with one contact</h2>
                    Hi - I have one contact that from yesterday I cannot communicate with. I can send him a message which he receives and he can send one in reply but I don't receive it at my end. my status is set to green with a white tick but he sees me as green with a
 white circle which possibly means my Skype is asleep? I don't seem to have this problem with anybody else and communications with others seem fine and I am marked as green with a white tick - any bright ideas would be highly appreciated

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that we have an ongoing issue with signing in to Skype and this issue seems to be affecting some functionality in Skype like, appearing as offline, contacts showing as offline and etc. This might be the reason why you cannot receive messages.
 Do not worry, our engineers are actively working to fix the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we recommend to try signing in using a different account or use Skype for Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for updates and news, we will keep you posted. You can check the Skype status change from time to time:

            Hi Kendrick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here's how to manage People app:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/use-manage-people-app-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/use-manage-people...</a>

            Did you try Edit?  
<br />
<br />Some providers may want their content edited in the online account only.  They may not let those settings be synched from Windows 10.  Same for almost all providers' Spam filters which cannot be not synched in Mail app.  Mail is only a sync service and subject to the Mail Provider's policy.

    <title>GTA IV&#58; Episodes from Liberty City, Rockstar Social Club &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hellz bellz 500  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA IV&#58; Episodes from Liberty City, Rockstar Social Club &#38; Games for Windows LIVE or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate the DRM</h2>
                    Me and my sister - the aforementioned Hellz Bellz 500 - have a problem. Before I go any further I would like to state that all of the mentioned games and services in the title work on my - the brother's - PC, which is hooked up to the same router with
 the same settings and a similar system set up. Okay so now the problems.
<div><br />
<div>So the problems first came to light when attempting to play the Steam version of GTA IV: EFLC. When starting the game we get to the R* Social Club log in screen, which flatly states that "Social Club unavailable. Play Offline or try again." When checking
 on my own PC the SC is available and I can log in no problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So when we play offline, GFWL pops down and asks us to log in. We dutifully do so and it asks for the CD Key. We type that in and it attempts to download my sisters profile. It's at this point it throws us the connection error message and refuses to log
 in. When checking the network connection we get this:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69df9c92-f435-44c6-b9c6-b5d482a9f185" /></div>
<div>However not only does my own computer have an internet IP address, it also says the UPnP is signed in. And when we check the Router settings we can also see that the UPnP is enabled. At first we thought the problem unique to GTA IV: EFLC, but as the Steam
 Sale progressed we bought more and more games that came with GFWL and the problem persists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is also strange that the problem only seems to affect GFWL and the R* SC, since my sister and I are still capable of playing other games such as L4D, TF2 etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To close this post I shall list off everything we have tried so far to get this to work to no success, if you feel you can help, but need even more information then please ask and I shall try to answer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>GTA IV: EFLC:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Install the latest patch from R* website - Unsuccessful</li><li>Verify integrity of cache from Steam properties - 5 files missing and re-downloaded</li><li>Run as Administrator - both right click and setting as default in compatibility settings</li><li>Add as a profile in windows firewall</li></ol>
<div>R* SC:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Change system time to 22/10/2011 - An old fix recommended by R*</li></ol>
<div>GFWL:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Install latest patch from Microsoft website - unsuccessful connection problems again</li><li>Add as a profile in windows firewall</li></ol>
<div>Windows 7:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Disable firewall</li><li>CMD - ipconfig /flushdns</li><li>Remove and Renew the IP address via CMD</li></ol>
<div>Router:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Port forward the required ports for GFWL</li><li>Enable "Game Mode"</li><li>Plug Ethernet cable into a different port</li></ol>
<div>Anyone got any other ideas?</div>

    <title>Eliminating password to log on computer with Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knudbartels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eliminating password to log on computer with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 did enter my computer from Windows 7 without having&nbsp;asked for &nbsp;my consent&nbsp;? !&nbsp;Windows 10 has been set to request my password whenever there is a start up and this - on top - has been set at minimum time i. e. 1 min .&nbsp; The reset procedure did not
 respond to any and to frequent request for change within 1 min and 5 hours frame . This response is a total and still lasting nuisance . The&nbsp;associated problem&nbsp;solution&nbsp;was &nbsp;to look for elimination of need for&nbsp;password to log onto my computer at all . And
 yes ,&nbsp;I learned about a&nbsp;"secret"&nbsp; MS advice , i.e. "Eliminating need for password&nbsp;to .............." &nbsp;In following said advice I was blocked off the procedure in learning that I was supposed to proceed via advanced user accounts control which on top demanded
 the administrator power , which I am lacking of. I tried to realize a procedure to gain administrator honours and failed again. Well at present I am forced to restart my computer a tenth or even a hundred times a day and every time I am calling "Windows 10
 curses on you" . By the way , I tried to return to Windows 7 as offered and you might guess it , it also failed &nbsp;(as expected) . From my point of view Windows 10 is a disaster .&nbsp;Another by the way , I am 82 years of age and I am still enjoying my computer
 but Windows 10 is about to spoil it for me finally !&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Search index is not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seabottom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search index is not working properly</h2>
                    <p>When I press the windows key and type in something, the search function won't find anything that is not in my documents folder.</p>
<p>It's pissing me off. Usually when I need a program I'd just type in the first 3 or 4 letters but now I actually have to browse the C drive to find programs and the other drives to find movies and stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, the indexing has been completed, there were 388.000 files, and then later I checked the windows folder and now the file count is going up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my settings for the search indexing and I checked literally everything to make sure I would find my stuff</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59eb9e9f-1662-476f-bf98-78a3f86c0f0e" /></p>
<p>Also it does say that it is preparing the search thing but it's been saying that for the past 2 days!</p>

If you go in to the indexing options does it actually say "Indexing complete"?

<p>I don't know if its because Cortana isn't working on non-english pc's or how they programmed the search function but I can tell you with absolute certainty that it's not working at all.</p>

            <p>No unfortunately not. I just went into my C drive and right clicked the programs that I wanted to be on my start menu instead. It's a work-around for now until MS fixes it.</p>
<p>Not being able to search is the utmost worst thing. It's not the index thats something wrong with, it's the search function it self.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, search works fine when in folders, but not in the start menu.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message you receive when you attempt to install Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Office?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Manually download the update from the download link below and then
 try to install it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Description of Office 2003 Service Pack 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923618</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Save the update on the desktop</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable the security software present on the computer temporarily</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Right on the security software icon on the notification area on the taskbar and disable it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; If this option is not available you may want to check the documentation supplied by your anti-virus program manufacturer for disabling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable
 the <strong>security software</strong> back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to install the update saved on the desktop, let me know if it works or you need further assistance.<br />

<p><span>Hi Alex Berm,</span></p>
<p><span>You may change the default to external speaker from the Control Panel or from Notification area.<br />
<br />
1. &nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click on speaker icon and select <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>playback devices.</strong>&nbsp; A new window titled<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>sound
</strong>should open up. </span></p>

<h2>            Problems logging on to internet</h2>
                    Hi, I have a HP15-f272wm laptop and I recently installed a new Samsung EVO850 500gb ssd hard drive. I have a Realtec 8188ee wireless adapter and I cannot log onto the internet or when I do it is so slow it takes forever. It was slow before but did log
 on. I also just installed the Win 10 fall creators download. I used the Samsung software to clone the drive. Any ideas what to try/ I've goggled everything and tried everything I can think of. Thanks, Mike

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update blue screen flickering&#33;</h2>
                    I had to update my windows to 8.1 from windows 8 two days ago and ever since then I am not able to use my start desktop. My normal desktop works fine but whenever I try to use the start desktop it constantly flickers between a blue screen and the desktop.
 This is highly frustrating because I can't even refresh my pc due to it needing to go through the pc settings app. Please help I really want my computer functioning again, Thanks!

<div>-Also when playing a game I get a blue screen error saying something about Memory management error....<br />

            If you restarted the machine, would it still be there on the " list " ?<br />
<br />
That said, you have not been clear in you post.<br />
<br />
" on the list "..... what list ?<br />
Where&nbsp;can that list be found ?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Critical Kernel Power error 41 &#40;63&#41;&#160;- &#40;12 to be exact&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Thanks everybody&nbsp;for all your posts and helpful hints.&nbsp; I'm really just posting&nbsp;so if&nbsp;Microsoft checks this board, they'll see the Critical Kernel Power error 41 (63)&nbsp;is still "alive and kicking", almost two years since the first post. &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husband bought this brand new HP desktop in Sept 2016.&nbsp; It came with Win 10 preinstalled.&nbsp; Since he was the one who purchased it, I have no idea where the&nbsp;paperwork is, and no&nbsp;clue as to the model #.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's what I can find:</p>
<p>AMD A10-8750 Radeon R7 processor<br />
12 Compute Cores 4C&nbsp;+ 8G<br />
12.0 GB, 360 GHz</p>
<p>64 bit OS, x64-based processor</p>
<p>OS:&nbsp; Windows 10, Ver. 1607 (OS Build 14393.576)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The first Critical Kernel Power error 41 (63)&nbsp;occurred on 9/28/16, and there have been&nbsp;12 total unwanted reboots, the last one was&nbsp;today, 12/15/2016 12:51:52 AM.&nbsp; You gamers sound like you're running roughshod on your PCs!&nbsp;&nbsp;LOL&nbsp; I was only playing Pretty Good
 Solitaire, and nothing else was open, and wasn't&nbsp;on the internet at the time.&nbsp; We're livin' large over here!&nbsp; haha<br />
<br />
I read through all six pages of posts, and decided to try one fix at a time.&nbsp; For those of you who followed up on a supposed fix that didn't end up fixing the problem, thank you!&nbsp;&nbsp; Saved us all some time.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I updated my sound card's driver.&nbsp; (Most of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Microsoft
 drivers that HP used in this computer are&nbsp;dated 2006. &nbsp;I&nbsp;checked for updates on just a few, and that's the most up-to-date available.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are such old drivers even compatible with Win10?&nbsp; Except for these kernel power errors generated after the computer shuts itself down, then reboots, the computer runs fine, and it's fast.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your input, folks, it is&nbsp;much appreciated.&nbsp; MICROSOFT!&nbsp; This problem has gone on long enough.&nbsp; It's time to solve the problem and include the fix&nbsp;in the next update.&nbsp; Yeah, I said "next update"!&nbsp; ;)</p>
