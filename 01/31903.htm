<h2>            Where are the documents saved in Win Vista</h2>
                    In Win XP, &nbsp;documents are saved in My document folder. In Vista is it 'document' under desktop folder where all documents are saved? I understand a sub folder needs to be created to save respective doc in the respective files.

<h2>            Run Doom95.exe  &#34;Unable to initialize &#39;doomlnch.dll&#39; error</h2>
                    I recently tried running The Ultimate Doom for Windows 95, since the disc was sitting in my library for so long without being played. I installed it, but when I tried to run Doom95.exe I was given the error "The ordinal 2 could not be located in the dynamic
 link library C:\Program File\Ultimate Doom for Windows 95\doomlnch.dll." and after I click OK, another window opens with "Unable to initialize 'doomlnch.dll'." I'm currently running Windows 10. Is there a fix for this?

            <p>&nbsp;Ultimate Doom is a DOS based game, so you will need to run it in DOS BOX.</p>
<p><em>D-Fend Reloaded </em>is a UI that helps make using DOS BOX a bit easier. DOS BOX is included in the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">D-Fend Reloaded: Overview</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded DOS BOX years ago but never go around to learning how to use it. </p>
<p>I do have a number of DOS based games from Good Old Games though. The GOG versions installs with</p>
<p>DOS BOX... Too easy ! ;) </p>
<br />
<p>- You should be able to pick the game up for $3- USD or less when GOG has a sale</p>

<p>Well... Get kills, get stuns.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>
<p>Now, for real help.</p>
<p>The best abillities you'll want to use at the beginning will probably be like smoke bomb and disguise, but use morph as soon as you get it. &nbsp;Remember, this is a stealth game: &nbsp;Be stealthy. &nbsp;Focus stealth kills over stuns, as they're worth a lot more points.
 &nbsp;If you know your pursuer is right there, but your target is as well, then go for the target. &nbsp;If you're lucky, you might get a stun in as well.</p>
<p>Really, that's a lot of what you need to know. &nbsp;Remember, though, have fun. &nbsp;Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play some AC: B.</p>

<p>Firstly, don't do what half the idiots do on this game..... And that's run around like a headless chicken! If you do, your target will see you a mile off with you having a red triangle above your head!</p>
<p>Secondly, keep off the roofs as much as possible! Your hunters will also spot you a mile off, and will probably take the lame excuse for 100xp and shoot you!</p>
<p>Third, use your surrounding like crowds. If you're waiting for your abilities to restore, enter a crowd with your persona in! This way you can increase your chances of surviving and getting some lure points.... Also handy too if your targets walks by for
 your "Hidden" bonuses!</p>
<p>Last of all, pick your abilities wisely! Personally, I'd go for both defensive abilities like Smoke Bombs and Charge. Pointless using a Hidden Gun due to lack of points and the time it takes to restore..... Plus, there's nothing more annoying than getting
 shot in the back from someone cowarding back on a roof!</p>
<p>I'll post a link of a vid on YouTube that will help you improve your skills.....</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I'm new as well, and I was wondering why you can assassinate some people by pressing the "X" button, while some others you can't?</p>
<p>I'll see people running around and are obviously human players, so I go by them and press "X," but nothing happens. Sometimes it works though, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>You are probably playing in Wanted. In that mode you are assigned one target who you have to kill. You can only kill that person, but you can stun anyone who is chasing you (a.k.a you are their target). Other game modes allow you to kill everyone in the
 opposing team (depending your team's function for that round)</p>

<p>To the OP, this game is not that hard to get used to tbh. I started playing 2 weeks ago and I got the hang of things fairly quickly. &nbsp;Stealth and observation work best for this game. If you are looking for your target in a crowed area or in a group that
 look all the same, watch closely (but don't make it obvious) for any human actions. I've managed to kill many people that are blended in a group just by observing actions that only human players do i.e moving around, standing in the center of the group, etc.
 One more thing, smoke bombs are excellent for defense AND offense. Learn to time your attacks and you are good to go</p>

    <title>Blue Screen from Specific Wi-Fi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sivanbh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen from Specific Wi-Fi</h2>
                    <p>A disclaimer: I have already asked this question before, and was asked to upload some files to help with troubleshooting. Unfortunately, a few weeks later when I went to reproduce the problem, I couldn't. I think the reason is that the load on the network
 is the cause of the crash, and since I tried this between semesters the load was not as heavy as usual. Now the new semester has started and, indeed, the laptop crashed within minutes of connecting to the network. Since it took so long to get these files,
 the question has been locked, so I have to post anew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS 9350 running Windows 10.</p>
<p>There's a specific location where connecting to the Wi-Fi results in a BSOD within about a minute or so. I emphasize this seems to be geographically isolated - the network I connect to is a university network and causes no issues in most of the campus, but
 in this location I have been getting BSODs consistently over the past couple of years. Other networks have caused no trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked to update drivers, BIOS, even revert the system. About a month ago I formatted the laptop (with not connection to this issue), reinstalled Windows 10 and then updated all drivers and firmware, so I think those steps can be marked as already taken.</p>
<p>As for crash files (dmp and nfo), they can be found here:</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P4PYoigXLYpUqHw7C7omI3xPY0YxGQDs</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />Recommendation
<br />1. Uninstall Avast and Enable Defender
<br />2. Go to computer manufacturer's website and update Broadcom wifi driver. Your driver date is 2016 which is very old. You can go to your Device Manager and find this driver &gt; Right click and disable it.
<br />
<br />I can see two wifi drivers for this model. You should install one of them first and if things don't work, then install second one.

            Probably Avast caused the crash. In my opinion, no need to reinstall wifi drivers ATM. Uninstalling Avast temporarily should suffice. Post back how that goes.

<p>I don't see how it can be Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before formatting the laptop I used to have AVG, but I had the issue back then as well.</p>
<p>Also, if it were Avast's fault, why does it only happen in this location? Using the same network but somewhere else on campus there's no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last experiment of mine pushes me to believe the issue is a result of network load&nbsp; messing up something on my computer, but I don't see how this "something" can be an anti-virus program.</p>

            Certain hardware configurations and Windows updates can break something and it takes a while to fix it. For example, like what is happening in your case. You can consider reinstalling it to eliminate the possible case of corruption, but more good results can be found by Uninstalling.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstalling my AV is a bit aggressive, don't you think? I trust it more than I trust Defender, and anyway, I had the issue before I had Avast (used to have AVG). I will, however, try to turn it off for a while, see if it really is related somehow.</p>
<p>2. This is really weird, that you say the wifi driver is out of date, since I really did update all my drivers about a month ago. Specifically, I checked my wifi driver in devmgmt and it says:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11f2da2d-528e-4ba2-9b69-020872a28e91?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11f2da2d-528e-4ba2-9b69-020872a28e91?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>so 2017. How is it that you see a different date?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I went on Dell's website and installed the two drivers you marked. After installing the first one, the wifi driver appears the same as before (which makes sense considering the dates) so I installed the second one but that didn't change anything
 either.</p>

<h2>            Windows Security Center service stops</h2>
                    I'm running windows 8 and my Windows Security Center service (Windows Defender) stopped automatically. I turned it on and it stopped again. This happens every time I turn on my windows so every time I have to turn it on again and again. I've performed
 a complete computer scan with Windows Defender and removed all viruses but the problems remains the same.

            Hi Pierhh, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Have a look at this Microsoft Support article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028678/windows-10-change-notification-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402867...</a>
<br />
<br />It shows you how to disable notifications on the lock screen.
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+I to open Settings
<br />- Go to System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions
<br />- Here you can disable notifications on the lock screen.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this resolves the issue! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

<h2>            Dymo Labelwriter 450 - prints to a file not USB001 Virtual Printer Port as it should</h2>
                    Yesterday I purchased a Dymo LabelWriter 450.<br />
<br />
Installed using latest driver (Support Win7 and Win8) and software package direct from Dymo as instructed.&nbsp; I was unable to print.<br />
<br />
Using their troubleshooting and support section I followed a step-by-step removal and reinstallation.&nbsp; Same issue.&nbsp; Today I spent nearly two hours in the online support chat system and was sent another copy of the drivers to install to try.&nbsp; Same issue.<br />
<br />
Here is the general behaviour:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I send a label print job to the printer - it shows in the window (spooling) and the port is correct - USB001.&nbsp; After spooling is complete (it is set to print after spooling) status changes to printing page x/70 (seventy label print job).&nbsp; What I DO find, which
 I think is odd, is a file appears in "My Documents" called USB001 and depending on the print job I send - the file resets to 0kb while spooling, and different sizes during "printing".<br />
<br />
This tells me to output bound for the USB Printing subsystem is ending up being written to the disk in my documents library.;&nbsp; Again I have verified the port is "USB001 Virtual Port" and not "FILE:" in the properties.&nbsp; This explains the lack of errors - to
 windows and the spooler it seems to print fine.&nbsp; However, clearly the output is not being directed to the printer via USB but to my disk.&nbsp; Even the Windows Print Test Page!<br />
<br />
Now I am at a complete loss as to why this is happening.&nbsp; This is the only directly connected printer with this computer - all other USB devices work on either of the two plugs, the printer does the same silly behaviour on both as well but is properly recognized.&nbsp;
 This is a newer laptop with two USB2.0 ports.<br />
<br />
The printer troubleshooter finds no issues, the "fix-it" tool finds no issues and the computer can see when I remove the USB and reattach after a few mins and recognizes is no problem.&nbsp; Dymo says it's a Windows issue so I don't know what else to try without
 some further guidance.<br />
<br />
Thank you to anyone who may be able to help.<br />

            <p>The folder c:\windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when using the command prompt I could not "cd PRINTERS" without using the cmd prompt window as administrator.&nbsp; Is that normal or is there a permissions / ownership issue going on there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted as well that as I originally stated - the output is being seemingly redirected into a file in "My Documents" named USB0001.</p>

    <title>Windows 10, Windows Media Player&#39;s video freazes and locks up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gl fox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, Windows Media Player&#39;s video freazes and locks up.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10, and Windows Media Player. I am also using an Intel i7-8700K CPU, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, on an Alienware Aurora R7 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never had this happen before on any other PC, but on my new PC, at times when going full-screen in Windows Media Player, the video image locks up. The sound is still playing, so the video is still running, but the video image is frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it locks me out of my PC and I can't get out of full-screen or do anything with my PC but look at the frozen video image wile I hear the video still playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get out of this by putting my PC to sleep with the power button, and hitting the mouse to wake it back up, but it can happen again at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video itself does not seem to matter, for if I play the same video again in full screen, it sometimes works, or if I use a video that worked many times before, will lock up too. So it is not any given video causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY PC is also fully up to date with the latest drivers, so it should not be a driver issue. I have had this PC for near a year now, and it has always had this issue with going full-screen in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what topics to add this to, for I don't see one that fits this very issue, so I added it to Performance &amp; system failures, as it seems to me to be the best fit out of all the given options I could find.</p>

            Hi GL
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It is likely related to your display driver. You might need to rollback to an older display driver to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />If its custom built, what is the make and model of the motherboard?
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you are not yet on the latest Windows 10 Feature Update, I recommend you update to it:
<br />
<br />Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a>

<p>I think the prob is with me having too many tabs open in my web browser when I try to play a video in full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though, if it is playing at all, I don't know why it would effect a full screen playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the system info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows 10 Home<br />
Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0.17134 Build 17134<br />
Other OS Description &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Available<br />
OS Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Corporation<br />
System Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DESKTOP-BUHJE8K<br />
System Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alienware<br />
System Model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alienware Aurora R7<br />
System Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x64-based PC<br />
System SKU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0858<br />
Processor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz, 3696 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)<br />
BIOS Version/Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alienware 1.0.18, 1/17/2019<br />
SMBIOS Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1<br />
Embedded Controller Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255.255<br />
BIOS Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UEFI<br />
BaseBoard Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alienware</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try restarting my graphics driver by pressing Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B if it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I will see if having my web browser closed will make a difference before I try to rollback drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens randomly, and not very often, so I will not know when it will happen again, and possibly not anytime soon, if it does again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will comment here again if it does happen again, and if any of the fixes you suggested seems to work.</p>

<h2>            How do I share documents in one Microsoft Account with another Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I want to duplicate some documents I have in one Microsoft account and put them in another. I'm not sure how to share between two accounts, but since both accounts are mine&nbsp; do I have to officially "share"? Can I find a way to open both accounts on my computer
 and manually copy one document from&nbsp;Account A&nbsp;onto Account B?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Yes, When ever you delete anything from OneDrive folder of the Window Explorer, same changes will sync to OneDrive website as well.</p>

Hi Leonard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Reader App on the screen perform the following.</p>
<p>Press the WinKey+C to display the Charms Bar.</p>
<p>Select the Devices Icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;can select from&nbsp;the installed printers there.</p>

    <title>checkdisk nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stravinskykof  say:</h3>
<h2>            checkdisk nightmare</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell windows 8.1 PC which crashed for some reason a couple of times yesterday. &nbsp;I had KERNAL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR message come up, and when I restarted I noticed that Microsoft\fsavailux was using a lot of memeory ..... but that's not the actual issue
 I face at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to do a disc check but when I tried I was told the disc was in use, would I like to have it run next time I start up. Of course I chose yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it started it stuck on 11% overnight, about 9 hours</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cancelled and ran it from the command prompt this morning ... It took 6 hours and all was well, no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the PC and again and the chkdsk starts. again &nbsp;Tells me to press any key within 1 second to stop it, but it doesn't stop when I do. &nbsp;So I'm stuck with a PC that automatically goes to check disk on startup, but never stops checking the disc and
 I cant stop it doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which means I can access my PC at all to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do or enter at the command prompt to stop it happening please? &nbsp;I have seen one suggestion elsewhere, but didnt work</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CHKDSK process can't be stopped once it started unless doing a hard reset. We don't recommend that you do a hard reset during the process because it may lead to file system corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you let it finish and once done, you can cancel the schedule for the CHKDSK process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further help.</p>

            <p>I just got a reminder regarding this as its still open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my remark would be thanks, but that wasnt the question I was asking. &nbsp;I would have let checkdsk run out, but it was not doing so at startup, and the last time it was up to 15 hours I left it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually solved it by running chkdsk from the dos prompt again and it seemed to run that way and finish in a short time</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what caused the original error problem, but chkdsk eventually seemed to repair the issue</p>

<h2>             Unable to open multiple files at once from Windows Explorer</h2>
                    I used to be able to select multiple files (.jpg, .doc) in Windows Explorer and then open them all at once. Now I can only open them one at a time. How do I fix that?

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Did you make any software/hardware changes on your computer, prior to this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;What exactly happens when you try to open multiple files?</div>
<div>4. How exactly do you open multiple files at a time?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check if the issue persists in safe mode (<strong>Step 1</strong>). If the issue does not persist in safe mode then, perform clean boot (<strong>Step 2</strong>) on your computer.<br />
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start the computer in safe mode. <br />
Refer: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."<br />
<div>Follow the steps provide in the below article to perform clean boot. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Umesh,</p>
<p>I've been putting up with this issue for several months. I've tried finding a fix via Google but no cigar. At first it seemed to be just jpeg's in Paint Shop but later I find that I have to open Word and Excel documents one at a time too. I used to be able
 to select multiple files in Explorer with a &lt;shift&gt; click or &lt;ctrl&gt; click and then click OPEN from the context menu and all the files would open; now nothing happens at all if I select more than one file at a time. The issue persists in safe mode.</p>

    <title>Program cannot send email using smtp, gmail and port 587 and TLS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyg45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program cannot send email using smtp, gmail and port 587 and TLS</h2>
                    <p>Until recently my backup program Acronis True Image 2015 was able to send email notifications via Gmail when my PC backups completed. &nbsp;The emails stopped when Google stopped supporting port 465 and SSL. &nbsp;Acronis told me to change the port to 587 and use
 TLS. &nbsp;On my Windows 7 PC it worked fine, but on all of my Windows 10 PCs, including one with a clean installation of Windows 10, the email fails with a Network Error and error code: 0x0064022B+0x0000FFF0+0x80070003. &nbsp;I have tried a number of suggestions from
 Acronis and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened an issue with Google, and they say the error code indicates a Windows update error. &nbsp;They think there may be a configuration issue and suggested I open an issue on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Control Panel &gt;Troubleshooting and found no errors checking Incoming Connections. &nbsp;I also ran sfc /scannow on the Windows 10 PCs, and no problems were found. &nbsp;My Windows 7 PC is on the same home network as the Windows 10 PCs and is connected
 to the same Comcast modem/router. &nbsp;I'm using the same security product on the Windows 7 PC and two of the Windows 10 PCs. &nbsp;It is Norton Security Suite from Comcast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that something in Windows 10 is preventing the use of port 587 and/or TLS, but it could some other configuration that is incorrect. &nbsp;Does anyone know how I can determine what is causing the error?</p>
<p>

            <p>Bruce,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply. &nbsp;I didn't see an option to open this issue in an email forum. &nbsp;If there is one, could someone move it to that forum? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program I'm using for mail is Gmail. &nbsp;Acronis True Image has a notification section where I supply the following information. &nbsp;Check the "Send email notifications about the operation state" box, enter my Gmail address in the To field, enter the outgoing
 mail server(SMTP) in the Outgoing Mail Server(SMTP) field, set the port to 587, select TLS, check the box for SMTP Authentication, and provide my username and password. &nbsp;When I click on Send a Test email, it fails with the Network Error on the Windows 10 PCs
 and sends an email on the Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen both Google documents previously. &nbsp;I do have both IMAP and POP enabled. &nbsp;I'm not certain why, but I do have POP3 setup for an old unused Yahoo email account, and an unused Comcast email account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have made Chrome the default browser, and when I go to Chrome's settings, it says Chrome is the default browser. &nbsp;When I go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Default Apps under Choose default apps, for Email it shows Google Chrome. &nbsp;Have I made an incorrect assumption
 that Gmail is my default email app? I couldn't find a Gmail app in the Microsoft App Store. &nbsp;Is this the cause of my problem(Gmail isn't the default email app)? If so, how do I correct it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 10 I don't use my nameATcomcast.net account for sending/receiving emails. &nbsp;I have Gmail setup as follows. &nbsp;In Gmail Settings&gt;Accounts and Import &nbsp;"Check mail from other accounts(using POP3)" lists nameATcomcast.net. &nbsp;Therefore whatever email goes

<h3> ariannarenee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer wont start up past Toshiba logo.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My laptop is the Toshiba Satellite L75-C7250</p>
<p>Over a month ago my laptop was working just fine except everytime i would go to turn it on it would take longer and linger to boot up every time.</p>
<p>Eventually one day i went to turn it on and it wouldnt boot up past the "Toshiba Leading Innovation &gt;&gt;&gt;" screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking about trying to see a tech pro and see if they cpuld fix it but my warrenty is up. I read that the Microsoft april 2018 update messed up a lot of peoples compiters and thought maybe that was the problem for me. I tried every way possible trying
 to boot my computer in the BIOS menu and try and get it to some kind of menu but nothing i do works. Ive tried reseting my computer 3 times by holding the off button for at least 5 seconds each time. Doesnt work. Ive tried all the F keys the delete key shift
 key, everything! Every possible way by holing it down before and after starting my laptop and repeatedly pressing the buttons.. Nothing. Im guessing my laptop is in like ultra fast boot or something.. I can have my laptop sit in for hours and it will still
 be stuck on the toshiba company logo. It will not go to the windows logo nor load anything past the toshiba logo.</p>
<p>I read online about downloading windows 10 on a USB flash drive and connecting it to my computer and get windows 10 back on my laptop if thats the case if windows wiped itself off my laptop. Just 30 minutes ago i put in the USB that i just freshly put the
 windows 10 on and nothing happened. Its STILL ON THE TOSHIBA LOGO and ive done everything ive said before plus putting the USB in before and after turning my laptop on.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution for this? All i can find online anywhere is people have only one or 2 of my problems and no matter what i do, what instructions i follow, nothing works..</p>
<p>Sorry for any spelling errors my phone doesnt like to autocorrect even though its on the highest autocorrect setting..</p>

            ok, so you put windows 10 on the usb drive, now you have to make you computer boot from the usb drive not you hard drive.  You'll have to press one of the function keys so that computer looks at the usb drive before it looks at the hard drive.  usually like f8-12.  Did you use the iso creation tool to make the usb drive that may also be a part of you problem you computer has to recognize the usb is a bootable device.   
<br />
<br />this video shows you how to make the usb

            Hi Arianna.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup using this key <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>  to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />1) Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> gatortribe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t remove viruses with BitDefender</h2>
                    I have two&nbsp;antivirus's&nbsp;(BitDefender Total Security 2011 &amp; Avira AntiVir Free) and because of that, my Bootcamp partition is useless (Avira won't show up in Programs and Features, so I can't remove it?). I have removed the viruses through Mac OS X (I used
 Sophos Anti-Virus to remove it [I use NTFS 3G, so don't tell me editing NTFS is not posible on Mac]) which is painfully slow. Does anyone know how to remove Avira AntiVir? It doesn't show up in Programs and Files, and I can't kill the task through the command
 prompt (using taskkill) or the task manager, as both tell me "Access Denied" even though I start with Administrator&nbsp;privileges. Can I edit the registry and remove Avira from the Mac partition if I have to? I know there has to be a folder where the registry
 is located. Thank you oh so very much.&nbsp;

 Batteries Several Times, I could`nt even use the God Button so the only way I could turn it off was by taking out a battery or Turning of the Console, This has been happening Constantly and since 4 Jan 2015 Mid Afternoon it stopped responding for good, Due
 to some Research I may not be the only one with this frustrating and annoying Problem, Very unhappy Customer here unable to use the Xbox One with a Controller :`(</p>

<h2>            Fallout 4 BSOD Windows 10</h2>
                    I have recently installed Fallout 4 and while I was playing I blue screened. I got this error msg clock_watchdog_timeout. So I just restarted and played a little more and blue screened again and again and again with every time being a different error msg.
 Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I am also willing to give more info If the need arises.

            Your cpu hardlocked big time and triggered blue screen. I'm 99.9% certain that's where your problem lies without even looking at a dump. That error code always refers to cpu interrupts not being handled properly, ie hard locked and non responsive.<br />
<br />
Are you overclocking your cpu by chance? Are the voltages correct? Is it overheating? Might not be actual failure but iffy settings. Fallout 4 is seriously heavy on cpu and memory in ways windows and most games aren't. It would expose weaknesses that other
 things wouldn't and those weaknesses don't always mean failure. Sometimes&nbsp;a few settings just need addressed.<br />
<br />
You could try going into your bios and reseting to default/clearing the cmos. Test everything at default settings only and see how that goes. Oh and don't just test with fallout 4. Also use prime 95 and strain it for a day constantly. See if it blue screens
 again at safety defaults. That should tell you if your cpu is gubbed or not. <br />
<br />

Edit: I doubt it's memory. It's possible that the motherboard is failing or psu but I'm pretty certain your cpu is either failing,&nbsp;badly set, badly slotted, badly overclocked or being overcooked. You see those multiple error messages? I've seen that before
 on a system I diagnosed. Turned out&nbsp;it needed the vcore&nbsp;turned&nbsp;down a notch and the&nbsp;cooler reworked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

====================================================</p>
<strong><br />
1.</strong> Suspect hardware - maybe video or memory however that is not a sure bet.
<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the cards memory and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies and clear the vents. Ensure the fans are working. Try adding a small fan blowing into the intake
 to reduce the effects of heat. (Heat related does not always mean excessive heat as a component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat.) Check the processor, heat sink, and the compound between them.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Check the memory very thoroughly. Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all errors such as the tiny speed differences between memory modules that appear to be identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different
 combinations and patterns. (See memory test methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>3</strong>. Check with your video card/device maker's support and forums - update drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> In needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> As needed use ALL the other methods in the troubleshooter below.<br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Main likely culprits are&nbsp;hardware, major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault.<br />

<p>==================================================<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with others playing Fallout4 to see if this is a known issue.<br />
<br />
Set it to factory specs until it is running right. <br />
<br />
It may not help however post the minidump so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
(Heat related does not always mean excessive heat as a component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat.) Check the processor, heat sink, and the compound between them.<br />
<br />
Check the fans and even add extra to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Video card along with memory can be in play here.<br />

<h2>            Regedit long path crash while searching the registry on Windows 10.0.10586</h2>
                    <p>Regedit long path crash while searching the registry on Windows 10.0.10586</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:<br />
1. Start regedit and search Computer for some text&nbsp;that will not be found, e.g. “sssssssss”.<br />
Or to reproduce it faster, first navigate to the problematic path:<br />
<br />
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1205654841-424901404-837385954-1001\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.6868.41111.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once regedit reaches the path above, the search will never end.<br />
Note: On older versions of Windows, it will just ignore this,<br />
continue and finish the search.<br />
<br />
2. Wait between 5-10 minutes. Otherwise the issue will not be reproduced.<br />
3. If regedit is still searching, cancel the search.<br />
4. regedit will crash and restart.<br />
</p>
Operating system affected:<br />
Windows 10.0.10586<br />
<p>
</p><p>Operating system not affected:</p>
<p>Windows 10 build 10240</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a System file check on the operating system which is affected .It is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System file check works on Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1, and win 10&nbsp;<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided,&nbsp;in the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</p>

</p><p>SFC didn't help. Unfortunately the system file checker can only resolve corrupted files and settings, it cannot resolve bugs in the Windows design. Microsoft should look at them and resolve them. This is clearly such an issue and I can reproduce it on any
 computer running Windows&nbsp;10.0.10586.318. I'm confident you can reproduce it too if you have that same build which is currently the latest. Please do that!</p>

            Hi all, Thought i'd post an update. As MadsDad stated, yes there is a new BIOS that fixes this issue. I finally got a hold of an Engineer at Lenovo and we worked together to build the new BIOS. This update also fixes sporadic Freezing issues that some
 models also experienced. Its here<br />

<p><span>Do you have a

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Reinstall the flash player</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam Edition, problems with gps and other SHIFT&#43; items</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, I actually know nothing about why this has ever happened but when I try to open GPS with shift+3, the gps comes for a milisecond that it can ony be seen by the frame of it then it disappears immediately after and it never comes back no matter
 how much you click shift+3. I checked the files of the game via steam and they all are just fine, I don't know why this happens, also I couldn't see the shift+3 key binding in controls settings, none of the GPS sections were keyed for something, other than
 that it might be a chance that this glitch happened after I set resolution to an upper setting (that's more accurate about how I remember when it occured, I'm not sure but GPS may have stopped working after I set up the resolution, I'll try that one again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your attention, I'll be waiting for the answers.</p>

and<br />
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\FSX-SE<br />
Don't forget to backup prior to remove.

<div>It would be logical to assume the new RAM is to blame, no?</div>

We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the contents of that folder<br />
* Please upload them to a file sharing service like "Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
