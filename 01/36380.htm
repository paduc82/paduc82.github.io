<h2>            My LG drive cannot read certain cdrs &#40;dvds reads fine&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Problem started after upgraded to Windows 7, it worked just fine on xp.<br />
The unreadble cd's can be read from my laptop using windows xp.<br />
<br />
my drive i'm having problem with is<br />
LG &nbsp;model: HL-DT-ST DVD-RAM GSA-H55N<br />
It's internal dvd burner driver that supports both CD/CDR DVD/DVDR &amp; DL cd's.<br />
<br />
Device manager showing it's installed correctly without any problem or conflict.<br />
Firmware version is 1.05 (it's already latest version. I've&nbsp;purchased from store with it, haven't touched it).<br />
<br />
Also problem seems to affect cdr burning as well, which fails.</p>

            The burner drive was already purchased with latest firmware rev (1.05) available under LG website.<br />
Drive was&nbsp;brand new product&nbsp;(i saw as it was taken out of retail box) - purchased along with&nbsp;the pc.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;eventually "gave up" &amp; purchased another burner drive&nbsp;(ASUS brand this time, as i figured i'll aim for other product that will not suffer same fate as the other drive).<br />
I was just too long without a&nbsp;working drive and i needed it working asap, left with no choice but to buy another.<br />
(i still left the other one, should this resolved in future)<br />
<br />
I couldnt find solution for my&nbsp;problem&nbsp;anywhere (either here or over other internet forums). I can say i've came across similar problems, also on LG drives &amp; windows 7, but none of them had any actual solution that worked for me. It was mostly support aimed
 at "did you make sure cd not scratched or dirty",&nbsp; etc. ...<br />
True, I cannot rule out any "hardware problem" that result with faulty drive that is not working properly.&nbsp;<br />
However, it&nbsp;seems too strange to be a coincidence, that a perfectly good drive stopped working properly after upgrading to windows 7 (plus the fact the dvdr reading &amp; burning works fine, and it's just the CDR burning/reading that not working properly)...<br />
<br />
wanted to thank you for your support efforts.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Idan.

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 10 to new drive after the old drive &#40;upgraded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon philiptalastas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 to new drive after the old drive &#40;upgraded Windows 10 from Windows 7 upgrade&#41; was corrupted</h2>
                    <p>I was forced to reinstall my Windows 10 to a new boot drive since my old OS Drive was corrupted and unbootable. Upon the knowledge that I only upgraded my Windows 7 OS to Windows 10 a few years back, I was confident enough to properly reinstall Windows to
 a new boot drive. Well, I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was typing my Windows 7 product key that is found on the back of my laptop. That key was not accepted. Upon researching, I saw that it Windows provides a new product key with upgraded Windows 10. Not sure if I am fully right here.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Anyone here knows how to get the upgraded Windows 10 key? Or I can use my old Windows 7 key? Or are there any other ways to reinstall Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. Hope I can resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Make sure you Reinstalled the correct edition of windows 10 on your device. (<strong>Home / PRO</strong>)</p>

            <p>Alright, that makes it a little harder to find, but definitely not impossible. &nbsp;There's a few ways I can think of. &nbsp;First, try just pressing&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl-Shift-Escape</strong> to open the task manager, and see if that dialog is listed as a 'running program'.
 &nbsp;If it is, you can right-click it in the list and choose "go to process" to find what program is actually responsible for showing that dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails to help, there's a more direct method. &nbsp;Microsoft makes a tool called
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Process Explorer</a> that can help. &nbsp;Run that program, and on the toolbar is a "bulls eye" crosshair that you can drag-drop onto the unknown dialog, and it will tell you what process is creating
 that dialog.</p>

            Thanks for getting back. Went into Task Manager, there was an App. running called ' Setup/uninstall (32'bit)' I Right clicked on it and went to'go to details and it is a AF.tmp System File!!! How do I deal with that? Thanks in anticipation.

            <p>I don't recognize that file by name, but let's try to find out what it is.&nbsp; In that details list, you can right-click the process name again and this time, choose "open file location" to find out where that file is stored.&nbsp; This might help identify what
 it is, where it came from, or at least help us remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to remove it, I recommend putting it in the Recycle Bin so that we can get it back if we absolutely need to (unlikely, but better to be safe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we need to find out where the instruction is that is telling the computer to run that file.&nbsp; Most likely, it's inside your Startup folder, or inside the registry entry that controls auto-start programs that typically run in the background.&nbsp;
 To remove it from there, the easiest way is to use the Startup tab in Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc) (or MSCONFIG for Windows 7 or earlier).</p>

            <p>Thanks for your continuing support. In 'Details' I have right clicked on AF.Temp and then 'Open file location' this opens a page titled 'is-805UM.tmp' and showing AF.tmp as a TMP File, when I Right click on this and attempt 'delete' a message saying 'File
 in use' The action can't be completed because the file is open in AF.tmp. Close file and try again and options 'Try again and Cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to Task Manager and attempted to end the running AF.tmp file and got a message - Do you want to end AF.tmp? - If an open program is associated with this process, it will close and you will lose any unsaved data. If you end a system process it
 may result in system instability. Are you sure you want to continue? with options End process and Cancel.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Greetings and I apologize for the delay.&nbsp; I was travelling for much of the day yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open the file location, can you check the address bar and see where it is running from? As a temp file, it is likely running from your temporary internet files location or another similar folder.&nbsp; I'd like to know where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it should be safe to end the process and delete the file (and, depending on where it is stored, also the entire folder the file is in), that'd be my recommendation.</p>

            Hi Avi
<br />
<br />When you have problems with partitioning jobs in Windows, it is best t use a 3rd party application, because Windows is very limited in its partitioning capability
<br />
<br />The free version of AOMEI Partition Assistant is as good as it gets, it is fully featured, easy to use and will do the jobs Windows will refuse to do . . .

            Hi  moreRless 
<br />
<br />Are you referring to the Windows Spotlight images on the Lock screen or images used for screen savers?
<br />
<br />There is no option to modify what images will show up as spotlight images. 
<br />
<br />If you are referring to your Desktop Slideshow, you will have to put the images you want to display in a folder and choose that specific folder.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Background
<br />Click in the Background listbox
<br />Choose Slide Show
<br />
<br />Browse then select a folder containing just the images you want to be used for the desktop slide show.

<p>I have been having issues with BF4 online, I have been getting real jittery/choppy game play online and I can't seem to figure out why this is, I really need some help.&nbsp; It is not my internet, I am hardwired with 85/35 MB speeds. I have tried adjusting the
 network smoothing but it does not change anything. It's just not smooth at all. </p>
<p>I had the same issues on my ps4, the game will run good sometimes but 80% of the time it runs like crap. does anyone have any idea what might be causing this to happen.

<p>the funny think is that all the people I played with all say the game is running fine for them having me thinking I am crazy. I have taken my Xbox and PS4 to my job and hardwired to their network which is double the speed I have at home and still experience
 the same stuttering especially on the conquest modes.</p>

<p>I haven't had any major issues with it online.&nbsp; However, it does use EA's own servers.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is either the severs you are trying to join may not be located in your country.&nbsp; If you joined a European game for example, and you are
 located in the U.S, this would cause some pretty bad latency issues.</p>

<p>it doesn't matter what region I join. I usually join US/EAST with low pings. I did notice when I used to play on my PS4, I got a more stable connection on European servers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem with mine, disc and digital. I have 50 down and 15 up speed. But I usually get around 55-58 down and almost 20 up. I have a fantastic router, and modem. I have tried hard wiring it, and have the exact same luck as when wireless. I
 have no restrictions on my router, I am out of ideas. Some days are better then others for me. But luckily I only play it about once a week, I have other games that I enjoy more at the moment.

<p>I have come to understand it's the game servers. I confirmed this by taking my Xbox/PS4 to my job and to a few friends house and played BF. I get the same thing at those locations. Please note that I have tried this with about 3 others Xbox ones and about
 2 PS4 so I know it's not an issue with the consoles.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is that all my friends that I play with on either consoles says they are NOT having issues....</p>

<h2>            Programs appear on the taskbar, but they won&#39;t open &#40;or maximize&#41; &#40;Windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I just got my new Acer Aspire V3 running Windows 8.1 and I'm happy with it until recently. Programs have been acting strangely because they appear on the task bar but no matter how many times i click on them they don't open. They still work
 in the background but I can't see what's going on. This video might help clarify my point. I restarted my PC numerous times to no avail. Would love if somebody would tell me how to go around this problem. Thanks :)</p>
<p>Edit: Here's the video: <del>http://videobam.com/qzdy</del>a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; does not work, sorry!</p>

            <p>Hi Robert.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know what was wrong! Apparently my apps wouldn't show was because I tried plugging in another monitor and it somehow messed up the programs. I followed another tutorial which said to go to
<em>Multiple Displays&nbsp;</em>and select <em>Remove this display. </em>and it worked.</p>

<h3> martinb.90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuum over DisplayPort - No signal</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought the HD-500 display dock for my Lumia 950. Now I have encountered an issue with connecting the phone to native DisplayPort screen (1920x1080). When connected, the phone recognizes the display including model number and starts the Continuum
 application. However there is no signal going to the display. I tried to connect it to other display (same model) with no result. Both displays were connected to phone using standard DP &gt;DP cables and are working well with laptop over same DP connection. The
 dock is working correctly over HDMI even with same displays via HDMI &gt;DVI adapter as the displays have both DP and DVI connectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using HDMI instead of DP will not solve my problem because of the setup I have and I want to know why the DP connection isn't working anyway because it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestion</p>
<p>Martin</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Where do you want to create shortcuts?</span></p>
<p><span>For which apps you want to do this?</span></p>
<p><span>What do you mean "</span>How do you run an App" from your description?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By simple drag and drop you can able to create shortcut for Windows apps. Say for example, if you want to create a shortcut to
<strong>Mail app</strong>, then click <strong>Start, </strong>drag the<strong> Mail app</strong>&nbsp;from the Start Menu screen to desktop screen. This action will create a shortcut for
<strong>Mail app </strong>on desktop screen. Later you can move these shortcuts to any location and can able to launch them from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can perform the same action for other Windows apps to create shortcuts. Moreover you can also
<strong>Pin </strong>app to taskbar. Just right-click on the app when it is opened on taskbar and select
<strong>Pin to taskbar.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t deselect file name extensions and hidden items</h2>
                    Good day
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 8 Pro. I have noticed that the file name extensions of all my files&nbsp;</div>
<div>are visible so I went to the View panel in my folder and under Show/Hide I saw that "File Name Extensions" are checked&nbsp;</div>
<div>and "Hidden Items"&nbsp;unchecked.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then tried to uncheck "File Name Extensions" but nothing happens. The check mark just&nbsp;reappears and I can't remove</div>
<div>the file name extensions so to speak. Also I can't view my Hidden Items because when I check this box it displays a check mark</div>
<div>for a split second and then it's unchecked again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also went to Folder Options in Control Panel clicked on "Show hidden files, folders and drives" and I checked&nbsp;</div>
<div>the "Hide extensions for known file types" applied it but nothing happens. When I reopen the Folder Options both of them</div>
<div>are unchecked again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can&nbsp;assist&nbsp;me in this matter it will&nbsp;gratefully&nbsp;be&nbsp;appreciated.</div>

    <title>No Sound after downloading drivers and reformatting computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladymartel4000  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sound after downloading drivers and reformatting computer.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a really big problem with my computer.<br />
This computer used to belong to a friend of mine but she got a new one and gave&nbsp;the old one&nbsp;to me. According to her and my cousin, they reformatted so it would be as good as new.
<br />
<br />
Sure, the computer was all good except one thing was and still is missing. No sound.
<br />
I searched all over the net for drivers, forums, error messages etc etc. Ran through the sound troubleshooter-what feels like a million times which hasn't helped me at all! I've got speakers but they still don't seem to work with the computer, so I've figured
 out that it is some driver problem. Funny thing is, my friend said that she originally did have sound.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After about five&nbsp;months later my dad went through the computer and said that the computer was actually missing some files. He also did say that I mentioned that my friend had her computers&nbsp;all linked up, my two computers however are not. So he thought that
 maybe the computer was waiting for something. Waiting for a signal from 'another computer'. I then though, 'ok, I'll reformat it'. I put the stuff I wanted to keep on my 8GB USB and reformatted it. While I was putting the stuff from my&nbsp;computer onto the USB
 however,&nbsp;a message&nbsp;came up saying that my mp4&nbsp;that was linked&nbsp;to my computer had malfunctioned. No, it's not broken, my computer thinks it is but it still charges and works perfectly fine.
<br />
Anyway-reformatted it-thought maybe sound will start playing...<br />
<br />
....No, I'm still getting the same THREE MIXED MESSAGES FROM THE COMPUTER!<br />
And on top of that my mp4 has still 'malfunctioned' as well as my USB. My USB works perfectly fine on the normal school computers! I've gone through Windows Update-it says that there is nothing left for me to download. There is no more security updates etc
 etc. What I did notice though that it downloaded a PCI SoftV92 Speakerphone Modem. Not sure if it has any connections to sound but thought I should mention it. I DO however have a question/exclaimation mark on Multimedia Audio Controller-just like before I
 reformatted the computer. It says that: 'The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28) To reinstall the drivers for this device, click Reinstall Driver.' Did that but it says that the wizard can not find the software. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled
 it but still nothing. My computer keeps bugging me with a message&nbsp;'found new hardware' if it isn't installed which is starting to really annoy me.&nbsp;I do have Audio Codecs, Legacy Audio Drivers, Media Control Devices, Standard Game Port, Unimodem&nbsp;Half-Duplex
 Audio Device and Video Codecs installed and are&nbsp;working 'fine'&nbsp;according&nbsp;to the computer. The computer does make those little 'beep' noisea when I'm closing something off but it isn't coming from the speakers.
<br />
<br />
The mixed messages that I'm getting from the computer are:<br />
<br />
From Windows Media Player 11: Windows Media Player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device. There might not be a sound device installed on your computer, it might be in use by another program, or it might not be functioning properly.<br />
<br />
From Sounds and Audio Properities: <br />
Volume Tab:&nbsp;No Audio Device. <br />
Audio Tab: Sound Playback:&nbsp;Default Device: Modem #0 Line Playback; Sound Recording Default Device: Modem #0 Line
<br />
Record.<br />
Voice Tab: Voice Playback: Modem #0 Line Playback;&nbsp;Voice Recording: Modem #0 Line
<br />
Record.<br />
<br />
Advanced Volume Controls: No mixer available (a message comes up but that's just the summary of it)<br />
<br />
Sound Record: Another application is recording audio. Stop recording with this other application and then try to record with Sound Recorder again.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I think I've covered everything, if you need more information, please&nbsp;let me know. If you also&nbsp;have any ideas on how to fix my 'malfunctioned' mp4/USB please let me know. I'll also state that my friend gave me no CDs inregarding to installing ANY devices/drivers.
 She is really hopeless when it comes to computers.<br />
Thanks~</p>

<h2>            Downgrade from Windows 10 to Compatible with Dell Inspiron</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I did the free Windows 10 upgrade on my Dell Inspiron, not realizing it was not compatible with my computer. &nbsp;I need to downgrade my software however, my computer came with XP, which is no longer an option apparently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been doing the free software upgrades as they have been offered to me to keep things current. &nbsp;I don't recall if I was using XP prior to the shift to 10 or if I had upgraded to 7 or 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the latest 8.1 to use that but its asking me for the code on the box, which I don't have, as that is not the software I purchased with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do get my computer downloaded back to a software that works with my computer? &nbsp;The graphics display issue causes issues with working almost every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the advice. &nbsp;Its past the 30 days so I have to do some kind of restore. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like I was using windows 7 prior to the upgrade. &nbsp;This would have been an automatic upgrade from XP when they discontinued that - so I don't have a product key to use to restore 7, as I didnt pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a place to get a key for 7 since it was an automatic upgrade from XP?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar issue has recently appeared on the Insider Previews...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a fix, but a workaround might help temporarily...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try opening Windows Media Player, and leave it open...</p>
<p>Then run your program and see if you get both video and sound...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Windows Media player are you using? WMP plays .mp4's just fine on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, here is the info on the WMP that is on my system:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a18333b-cc72-4b33-a35d-762bc367f500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a18333b-cc72-4b33-a35d-762bc367f500" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/691df6d9-a2ce-4722-8772-1ccf66a70ba2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/691df6d9-a2ce-4722-8772-1ccf66a70ba2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, as a workaround you could try this:</p>
<p>Download and install <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
7-zip</a> then after it is installed right-click on the said .exe file&nbsp;&gt;7zip &gt;extract here, this will create a new folder&nbsp;that contains the extracted components of the .exe file. You should then be able to select and play the .mp4 in the&nbsp;media player of your
 choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can help you, at least in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard&nbsp;</p>

<p>5) Hit "Apply"</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Close out of all of the open windows and start over with the Advanced button...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) select "ADD" near the bottom</p>
<p>2) select "Select A Principal" at the top...</p>

<p>5) Select User from list...Your user name, or any you want to add.</p>
<p>6) Give the new user\owner full permissions... </p>
<p>7) Do Not check the box "Include Inheritable Permissions From This Object's Parent""</p>
<p>8) Select "Apply"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now right click on the file and select "Rename"... I just add a + to the beginning of the name...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be denied when attempting this because the file is open... So...</p>

                    <p>Where is start menu properties tab under taskbar and start menu properties?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "start menu" properties tab under "taskbar and start menu properties" is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to name the&nbsp; "taskbar and start menu properties" if the start menu is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this this is a crucial feature for people who have impaired vision or just want to enhance the start menu settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only preset settings for color/size of fonts are available under start settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring back the The "start menu" properties tab under "taskbar and start menu properties".</p>

            Yes I've noticed it on two different computers (both of which are 'high spec' - 7700k/8700k cpu and 16GB RAM).&nbsp; I find the game almost unplayable at the moment - I regard myself as a bit of a Freecell 'expert' (sad I know).&nbsp; But after the latest upgrade
 I find that I keep on clicking on a card to move it and find that I've 'missed'.&nbsp; Also on one of these PCs the cards seem to be blurred part of the time.&nbsp; Hard to explain, but play it and you'll find out.

</p><p>Badly....&nbsp; I have been playing Microsoft Solitaire for years and as a premium user now find it irritating to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Spring 1803 update, moving cards is now slow and laboured,&nbsp; It's like trying to wade through treacle....&nbsp; ( not that I have )</p>
<p><br />
It's not resources, these are fully optimised, and the processor is an i7.&nbsp; I have also tried resetting to no avail.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I certainly will not be renewing my Solitaire subscription unless this is corrected.<br />

<p>Agreed, the update is terrible. Much less responsive. On the plus side, it's giving me back some of my time, since I won't play now.</p>

<p>I have been having the same problems.&nbsp; Everything seems to lag while playing any of the Solitaire games and it started immediately after the update.&nbsp; My system is a high end gaming system and other graphic intensive games run just fine so I'm confident it's
 not my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a small issue but before the update, when you finish a game of FreeCell, clicking a couple cards up would speed up the rest of the cards to finish the game.&nbsp; I could probably turn auto finish off and finish the game faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been a premium user for a while and feel that some sort of compensation needs to be offered once fixed.&nbsp; If not fixed, I will definitely not be renewing my subscription.</p>

            Just after the spring update I noticed my times on Klondike were around 30% faster and I repeatedly broke my personal best times. On June 7th it suddenly returned to normal. I wish now I had captured a few games so I could see if the clock's speed was
 running slow or if the program was just responding better.&nbsp;

                    I have had this trouble before and after I reset it worked for a short while then stopped.&nbsp; Now if I go to reset it deletes the skype button and I have to reload. &nbsp; When is this problem going to be sorted once and for all.&nbsp; It is most annoying that people
 have to send a text message to my mobile when they wish to contact me, otherwise I have to sit in front of the computer.

<h2>            AMD Radeon graphics card disabled after update to windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have dell inspiron 15R 5521 with AMD Radeon HD 8730M graphics card. </p>
<p>After upgrading to windows 8.1 single language my graphics card has stopped working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have done the following - </p>
<p>1. Installed a new version of Catalyst Control Center with HydraVision</p>
<p>2. installed driver from dell.com and then my computer crashed ( I had to bring back my PC into normal state by restoring it to a previous point in time)</p>
<p>3. Installed new driver from dell for windows 8.1 but it is of no use</p>
<p>4. tried removing it and then reinstalling ( this idea failed too)</p>
<p>5. searched AMD for drivers but all I get are links for CCC</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I bring back my AMD graphics? I use programs like Blender 3D (animation software) and MineCraft which are heavy process softwares.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From where exactly are you trying to install the driver? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue normally occurs when there is any third party program conflicts with the driver software that you are installing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. <font color="#000000">I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check the results.

                    We have a user who upgraded to Windows 10 less than a week ago and isn't happy. &nbsp;Whenever I log in as administrator to revert her O/S back to Windows 7 and click the "Get Started" button, literally nothing happens. &nbsp;No error message, no response, no hourglass/waiting
 cursor. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;I've tried doing a fresh reboot and immediately going to the recovery options screen before loading anything else, and still no response from the button.

            <p>In our case, we found that the button would not work if we logged in as the Domain Administrator account or the local Administrator account. Don't ask me why, but if the logged in user is named "administrator" then the roll back button does nothing. Go figure.
 When we logged in as another user that was in the administrator group (but was not named administrator) on the machine, then clicking on the "Get started" button began the rollback wizard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hit another problem after that. It said that we needed to remove a new user account that was created after the upgrade to Windows 10 before it would allow us to rollback. In our case it was a domain user account. We removed it by going to System control
 panel | Advanced Settings | User Profiles. After removing the new domain user profile from the computer we were able to do a successful rollback. I wish these things were documented. I hope this helps others.<br />
