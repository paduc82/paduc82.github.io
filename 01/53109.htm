<h2>            Window update error &#34;80070005&#34; Various Causes &#38; Solutions</h2>
                    <p>There are several ''fixes'' posted on various threads.&nbsp; For some, these fixes work well.&nbsp; For others, not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself have had this same problem on several Windows 7 computers.&nbsp; Most have been resolved by using the Microsoft utility titled:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, one of my computers could not be repaired no matter how many ''fixes'' I have attempted.&nbsp; I had finally reached the point where I was about to do a complete re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; However, I was hesitant to do so because that has _also_
 failed to help me in the past.&nbsp; It seems as if every time I install Windows Update Sp1 for Windows 7, the result is the same error (80070005) after the update is applied... At which point the ''WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diacab'' fails to make the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that reason, I repeated a ''fix'' that I had done in the past, only this time I tried something different, which finally worked.&nbsp; I did as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) System Restore: Use the ''Restore Point'' date when Windows Sp1 update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) After restart, and after system is up and running again, _THEN_ use the ''WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab''</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The fix was _then_ able to repair my ''80070005'' error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Restart computer (just to be sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Run Windows Update to install the Sp1 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) After reboot, and after system is up and running again, then _once again_ run the ''WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab''</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) If the diagnostic utility says all is well, you're done.&nbsp; If not, it is at this point where other posted ''fix'' remedies can be tried with (perhaps) better success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: With regard to other ''fixes'' involving the installation of ''subinacl.exe'', please be aware that the file can wind up being installed in locations that will not allow the ''reset.bat'' file to work.&nbsp; The most common installation location
 is: Program Files\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\subinacl.exe.&nbsp; The _easiest_ remedy for this ''incorrect location'' problem is to perform a search for the ''subinacl.exe'' file (without the quotes), and then once you have located it, open the location and copy
 the file ''subinacl.exe'' and then ''paste'' it to the System32 folder of _any_ version of Windows 7 (both x86 _and_ 64bit).&nbsp; Then, the ''reset.bat'' file will perform correctly for you.&nbsp; (In other words, there is no need to alter the commands in the ''reset.bat''
 file, if you simply copy and paste the ''subinacl.exe'' to the System32 Folder of _any_ Windows 7 version).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- The ''Important Note'' tip above, by itself,&nbsp; can solve the ''80070005'' for many people who have been unable to _apply_ the ''subinacl.exe'' fix. --</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for myself, I intend to run the ''WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab'' before and after any ''major'' update and/or when Windows Update is seeking to install a large quantity of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personal Note:&nbsp; I no longer run Windows Update in ''Automatic'' mode.&nbsp; I now have it set to ''Check for updates but let me to choose whether to download and install them.''&nbsp; This gives me the opportunity to choose whether or not run ''WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab''
 before downloading and installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My Explanation:&nbsp; Apparently, on some systems, the ''80070005 error'' actually exists _prior_ to installing the Sp1 update.&nbsp; For some reason Windows Update will install the Sp1 update even though the ''80070005 error'' already exists in the system _prior_
 to the update.&nbsp; Then, after the Sp1 update is installed, it then becomes utterly impossible to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other systems, the installation of the Sp1 update _itself_ will always result in the ''80070005'' error.&nbsp; For those users, the ''subinacl.exe fix'' (used along with with the ''reset.bat'' file), will very likely repair the problem; (if done as I explained
 above in my ''Important Note'' tip).</p>
<p>
</p><p>CAVAET:&nbsp; It has been my experience that no single fix works for everyone, and for many there does come a point where the _only_ solution is a totally clean re-installation of Windows.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please note that sometimes you will get this error (and/or possibly a different coded error) simply because a particular update has already _previously_ been installed.&nbsp; If your Windows Update refuses (''failure'') to install _particular_ updates,
 but is capable of installing other updates, the solution is very simple. Just ''hide'' the offending updates so that Windows Update will no longer attempt to install them.</p>

    <title>File association problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daddyo007  say:</h3>
<h2>            File association problem</h2>
                    
<p><span>I wanted to see if windows explorer could preview winrar files (.RAR file extension) like it does with winzip (.ZIP file extension) files. So I right clicked on a winrar file and
 clicked on "open with." This opened up the "open with" box which says, "choose the program you want to open this file:" There was a check mark in the box marked "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file." I then browsed to the windows directory
 and chose "explorer.exe" and then clicked on OK in the&nbsp; "open with" box. I started seeing the spinning circle but nothing happened. The spinning circle would not stop so I rebooted. After the reboot, I noticed that all the RAR file icons now looked like the
 windows explorer icon. </span></p>
<p><span>The first thing I tried to was going through the same process as before to set the file association of .RAR files back to winrar. The problem was that the check mark in the box
 marked "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" was grayed out and could not be selected. Windows was blocking me from taking the association away from "windows explorer."&nbsp;I even tried it in safe mode, but that did not work either.</span></p>
<p><span>I then went in to the "default programs"&nbsp;located in the start menu. I clicked on associate a file type or protocol with a program. I started looking for the (.RAR file extension),
 but it was not in there.</span></p>
<p><span>So then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling winrar, both in and out of safe mode, but that did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I tried was running the system restore, but that failed. I'll have to look into that later, it has failed the last three times I tried because it could not find a file it
 was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I read through the post called "<span> Problems with "File Association" in Windows 7 64-b</span>it"</span><span>
 on this site, but did not find an answer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I did see something about "To fix the corrupted user profile you may refer the link below:" I followed the link and did the stuff it suggested. I made
 a new user and copied all of my "user files" to the newly created user. When I logged in, the file association problem was gone, but now I have to reload all of my programs, set up all of my settings, wallpapers, icons, DPI setting. More than I want to do
 if I can save my other user account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please help!</span></span></p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sometimes there is a delay in the boot process.
<br />
<br />You noted you are able to see the boot logo.
<br />
<br />How long did you wait?
<br />
<br />Could you leave it for a few hours to see if it boots?
<br />
<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment

<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue

            Hi JohnLinn 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Steps B &amp; C  (Restore and Reset) can also be performed from Media creation tool if they can't be done as above. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section "Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />E. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<p>I agree and second Morton Redner's post, being in the same situation, ie. I do not have a microphone problem at all, my problem is that all the Skype contacts on my list disappeared when I up-dated my Skype.&nbsp; How can I retrieve the full list?</p>

<h2>            Unable to detangle SKYPE&#47;MICROSOFT name&#47;e-mail address&#47;password mess</h2>
                    My wife simply wanted to sign in to SKYPE for a family talk and we are now deep into a tangle where Microsoft's 'system' rejects anything and everything we try to set.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; It all started when Microsoft indicated that her SKYPE information
 was from more than 12 years ago with a different address.&nbsp; She has been using SKYPE all these years but the most recent update in WIN10 Home seems to have knocked that off.&nbsp; How does she/we start over with current information without being told any confirmation
 will be sent to an email address abandoned a decade ago and when the 'system' now does not even accept her name as accurate?

<p>Sorry to have been offline for a while.&nbsp; Medical issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife threw out --- in frustration --- the various combinations we tried for both Skype and Microsoft accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;The old Skype account was for hxxxxxxxxxxxs1 and at one point informed us that the address was one we had abandoned over a decade ago.&nbsp; We
 have tried to update her internet address to her current one, 
hxxxxxxr@xxxxxxxxm, using that as a name/address and combinations.&nbsp; Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; FYI:&nbsp; the Microsoft script for getting new accounts is not straightforward&nbsp; and I have heard from others that it is "tricky" to complete.&nbsp; I must agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; That said, she is now off Skype now.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Having spend several hours once I'm leery about&nbsp; re-creating the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>We feel for your frustration. The account recovery process is fully automated and the only way to lift the restriction of the account is to provide the correct and matching information for the account you are trying to recover.

<p>
</p><p>We suggest for you to revisit the answers provided on the form, change whatever is inaccurate; then resubmit the form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all things fail, we suggest for you to create a new account instead. </p>

            Hi Laforce,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. There is an error in System restore but code is different. However, you should try this.
<br />
<br />System Restore error 0x80070091  - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-restore-error-0x80070091/cedb6d6a-a3cf-4917-a6c0-a1544631adb6">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Otherwise use Media creation tool to perform system restore. (Refer to section - Use installation media to restore or reset your PC)
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Peace44. You safest option is to backup all files first then do a reboot 
<br />
<br />However if you select upgrade install of doing a clean install when installing it, you will not lose files. Just do not format the drive when you do it. 
<br />
<br />More info here on how to install 8.1: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15356/windows-8-install-update-kb-2919355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15356/...</a>

            The custom install itself would be the same as downgrading.

<h2>            Old account - I am not able to cancel&#47;delete the subscription</h2>
                    I have an old account that I used when I worked for a company, but I do not remember the password. I want to cancel that account to avoid to have multiple accounts. It causes problems when someone is looking for me. The form that I filled numerous times
 is not available, but I did not have the proper opportunity to fill with some information to prove that I am the owner of that old account. My picture is there and at least would be good to delete it.&nbsp;

            Thank you Danida, but I do not remember some information the system request. I should be able at least to inform more details about me, and the two pages of that form were not enough. Maybe the Microsoft has another way or even another form to help me
 to fill with my information to prove that I am the owner of that account.

            Danida, I already did that procedure more than 10 times and the systems blocked when I try again. Is there any other way to recover my account? I have so many information that I can share to prove that I am who I am. The algorithm used in the computer
 does not understand this because it is a program. I need to do this process with a human.&nbsp;

<p>The automated recovery form is based on the information found on your account. This is the only option available for users with recovering their accounts especially if they do not have access to the associated security info.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to submit a recovery form once more, however this time use a device where a previous successful sign in occurred. As long as the information you provided match the account, you will be able to recover it.</p>

            Unfortunately,&nbsp;my current computer never was used to access the Skype account. The form does not allow me to pass the first page. The company should allow me to be able to fill more information than just the first page which asks me a password that I do
 not remember (I can try some, but it will block me again). It should have a way to fix it. My picture is there for instance. If I denounce the account as fake, will you delete it?

<p>I am afraid that the only option to move forward is to pass the recovery process. Skype does not have the option to manually delete accounts from our end as all account related processes should be done on the users end.

<p>The problem is that I do not remember any password (first page). The following questions on the same first page I answered. Then the form closes and informs me that I will receive an answer. I do not move to following pages, for instance. Then the system
 sends me a message that I tried so many times that I will not be able to recover it never more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 Standard User logs on, the device is blocked once again. </p>
<p>While logged in as the Standard User, we are unable to access the User Account Control settings. If the Admin logs back in, the device works, as the UAC setting is set for the admin as Never Notify.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to turn off the UAC for a Standard User?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>

<br />
Sorry, you can't - this would defy the very purpose of UAC. Your problem is probably caused by software that is not Windows 7 compatible. I would approach the supplier of the fingerprint reader software.<br />

            <p>Hi Sharad Raghuvanshi75,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes the the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What files are there on your USB pen drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> To view the hidden files follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b> menu and click on
<b>Programs</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Accessories</b> and click on
<b>Windows Explorer</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>Tools</b> (if you cannot see tools then press Alt on your Keyboard) and click on
<b>Folder Options</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>View</b> tab and check ‘<b>Show hidden files, folders and drives</b>’</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that there is no check mark placed near ‘Hide empty drives in Computer Folder’, ‘Hide extensions for known file type’ and ‘Hide protected operating system files’.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Insert your USB flash drive and check whether you are able to see the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what files are present in the USB drive. If there is nothing very important in the USB drive, then I would suggest you to format the whole drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Format the USB drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>Before formatting the USB if there are any important files, then copy them and then format the USB drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Insert the USB drive in the system.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Once it is detected, open <b>Computer</b> by clicking on the
<b>Start</b> menu.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><b>Right click</b> on the USB drive letter (e.g. E:\) and click on
<b>format</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>If you format the USB drive, then all the files that are present in the drive will be permanently removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<h2>            Clean install of Windows 10 from ISO files activation</h2>
                    <p>I have a genuine copy of Windows 7 Professional with sp1 on my laptop. I have never installed any Windows 10 build on it. Can I perform a clean install of Windows 10 instead of an upgrade? After the installation of the Windows 10, will it recognize my product
 key for windows 7 embedded in the BIOS previously to activate my windows 10 as genuine? I don't want to do the upgrade for that machine, just want to perform a clean install with the windows 10&nbsp;ISO files and want to be sure that my Windows 10 will be activated
 by recognize my OEM product key in the&nbsp;BIOS.</p>

    <title>Creating a Wireless Hotspot from a wired connection in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a Wireless Hotspot from a wired connection in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I used to be able to do this in Windows 8. I made a batch file and created my own hotspot from my ethernet connection in the CMD prompt, and ran it as administrator whenever I wanted to open the connection. Ever since 8.1, every time I run it and open
 the network, I get a blue screen shortly after. So this makes me believe that this feature has been removed from 8.1. Anyone know a way I can do this?

            I have tried the only two third party software out there - Virtual Router and Connectify - and both fail with creating the connections. I have opened up the CMD in administrator privileges and allowed hosted networks, but still the connection in unreachable
 by many all devices. This wasn't a problem and was easily avoided in Windows 8, why have things gone backwards for Windows 8.1? This is such a basic need that NEEDS to be filled, allowing internet sharing from a wired device to wifi only devices, yet somehow
 the newest version of Windows is blocking this from all angles.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting your query.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Svchost.exe is a process on your computer that hosts, or contains, other individual services that Windows uses to perform various functions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>TASKHOST is a generic process which acts as a host for processes that run from DLLs rather than EXEs. At startup TASKHOST checks the Services portion of the Registry to construct a list of DLL-based
 services that it needs to load, and then loads them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate the steps you have performed. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps. Follow the below method.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and
 check if it helps to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to boot the system in safe mode and check if the issue still persist. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer with only basic service and functionality.
 If an existing problem doesn’t reappear when you start windows in safe mode, you can eliminate the defaults settings and basic device drivers as possible cause.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks so much for your reply Billion:&nbsp; <br />
1) Tried the first method of Microsoft Safety Scanner, with a full scan.&nbsp; <strong>
No infections detected.</strong><br />
While the scanner was running, I checked Maintenance and Reliability and there were 3 errors by
<br />
Svchost.exe -- thus the problem continues. Plus I had another issue regarding System Settings Broker as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Description</span><br />

<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">
<p>
</p><p>Faulting Application Path: C\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsBroker.exe<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem signature (Problem Event Name : AppCrash)<br />
Application Name: SystemSettingsBroker.exe (plus more detailed data if you want it)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I'm a bit skeptical about running method 2 as shown in the link.&nbsp; I have had problems with this
</p>
<p>before.&nbsp; Specifically getting locked out without access to drivers (mainly the mouse and keyboard).<br />
What about accessing system configuration by changing to "safe mode" through the run command msconfig?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            I have not marked this post as an answer, since it turns out that Norton antivirus seems to have been the culprit for such errors.&nbsp; I just uninstalled Norton and am using Windows Defender instead.&nbsp; Let me monitor any repeated computer problems or none
 at all for at least a week and I will then mark this post closed. Thanks.

            Thank you for your reply and advice.&nbsp; I had updated Norton to the most current version and still it did not help on the issues of this thread.<br />
With the help of Microsoft's Answer Desk, Norton was uninstalled.&nbsp; I have been running Windows Defender for a while and had not had a single problem.&nbsp;Thus this thread can now be closed.

<p>If you are used another partitioner, like me, I used linux to get rid of that 100MByte windows partition, and installed linux next onto another HDD, I needed to pull of the cables from the linux HDD and then using only the Win7 HDD I can install Win7 SP1.
 I hope it's a solution for your problem.</p>
<p>If you still can't install it, or the linux is on the same drive, I think there's no solution. Only to re-partition the whole HDD and use Win7 partitioner.</p>

    <title>0xc000000f after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leftofnormal  say:</h3>
<h2>            0xc000000f after reboot</h2>
                    Got the following error this morning after restarting my laptop running Windows 7 RC1:
<br />
<br />
Windows Boot Manager<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software chance miht be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings and click "Next."<br />
3. Click "repair your computer."#<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible. <br />
<br />
I rebooted and selected the Repair option but it comes right back to this screen.
<br />
<br />
I then booted from the Win7 DVD and selected the repair option, but the automatic attempt failed as well.
<br />
<br />
After giving up and deciding to uninstall, when I got to the screen to select which partition to install to, I noticed that my primary partition had approximately 80 GB more free space than it did the night before. I haven't yet gotten back into Windows to
 verify this but I have noticed that the contents of my Dropbox folders were wiped after this happened.
<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had a similar problem? I haven't run any type of hard drive scans yet to ensure it's not a hardware issue.
<br />

            Hello forum users,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your responses to the community forum.<br />
<br />
Initially from the issues experienced it may be that USB storage devices are attached to your systems, either for Readyboost or in another degree and the failure initially starts due to that cause.<br />
<br />
We are somewhat running into a number of different possible instances here and just taking the general review of the community members issues, at these points it sounds as though, since repair installation did not provide any resolve, a clean install is the
 only options.<br />
<br />
I'm not aware of issues with the .msi causing any deletion of files on hard drives, however, always be certain that any download is done from a reliable source, virus and malware may infiltrate in some instances and cause results that we do not expect.<br />
<br />
If you do need assistance moving forward with a clean installation, please post back to us to let us know.<br />
<br />
Please keep us advised of any further information we may provide for you.<br />
<br />
One other note, you may want to visit the Technet forums for further information involving the content of these issues.&nbsp;

wonder how those BIOS settings are following this thread. I think you won't get the errors when your boot sequence is set to the HDD where Windows 7 is installed only.<br />
And when Windows 7 is installed as last OS in line, containing the boot loader if you have Multi boot configs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

<h2>            I&#39;ve already switched my home xbox three times this year&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently tried to switch my home xbox to a new one however I keep getting a message saying that I've already switched it three times this year when in fact I have not. To be completely honest i don't think I've ever switched my home xbox before. Ive looked around recently and I think I've found it has something to do involving a new update but I'm not sure. Just looking for help or suggestions. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p><p><br /></p><p>Mafia II is compatible for X1, as specified in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-Us/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">list</a>. Make sure your console is properly connected to the Live service. Once you insert the disc, it will be asked you to download the compatible version. To play you will still need to keep the disc inside the console.<br /></p>

    <title>Right-clicking in OS shell causes Explorer crash and restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scuba steve in va  say:</h3>
<h2>            Right-clicking in OS shell causes Explorer crash and restart</h2>
                    I am one of the many who have an issue with explorer crashing when I right-click in the OS shell in Win 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I right-click on an item (e.g., file, folder, library, shortcut in the start menu, ...) explorer frequently crashes...displaying a message box...and then eventually displaying another message box (with a progress bar) stating that explorer is restarting.&nbsp;
 The issue is sporadic.&nbsp; It may happen consistently for some period and then it may not happen again for a little while.<br />
<br />
The issue started on my 64bit Win 7 Pro system after a clean install.&nbsp; I had also installed other software (late versions from the web...not old code).&nbsp; Thus, I started uninstalling things...and also used
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ShellExView</a> to disable every non-Microsoft contextual menu extension...and it still happened.<br />
<br />
Thus, I rebuilt my system again..from scratch...clean install...and then followed that install with only three things:<br />
<br />
1) I allowed Windows to update itself<br />
2) I added the latest version of Avast antivirus (free)<br />
3) I installed the latest version of Firefox<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...and boom...explorer crashed again the same way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Others report this issue occurring on a complete vanilla install of Win 7 with nothing else installed...including no third-party drivers.&nbsp; I have encountered dozens of folks reporting the issue.&nbsp; Here are just a handful of recent reports:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.sevenforums.com/crashes-debugging/34826-right-click-desktop-causing-explorer-exe-crash.html<br />
http://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/19169-right-click-causes-explorer-crash-fix.html<br />
http://www.sevenforums.com/crashes-debugging/22061-windows-explorer-crashing-right-click-under-x64-rtm.html<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Multiple folks have performed analysis using various profiling and dump tools and all signs indicate heap corruption...and the data looks like Explorer is stepping on itself...not a third-party component doing it...but we don't have the source code to find
 the specific problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly, there is a problem...and we would appreciate, at the very least, something that sounds like "we are aware of the issue and are looking into it"<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />
Steve

            sadly guys I gave up and reloaded but my apps will be the same in the list but I will not load anything on this machine but the basics until I am sure the issue is gone.<br />
<br />
Right now I have this installed<br />
<br />
all default drivers but one Intel AHCI drivers latest build<br />
<br />
Opera<br />
Firefox<br />
Flash<br />
Java<br />
Kaspersky Internet Security<br />
Trillian<br />
<br />
that is all I will keep till this thing is running at least 3 days or more without an Explorer crash. If it crashes again like before I am going back to Vista and not moving to Win7 until Service Pack 1 and I build my next machine. I can't spend day after day
 on this and I do not want to. If it is Windows issue (which I feel strongly it is after all of that) then it's pretty sad that something like that got behind testers.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the 32bit version would be more reliable and this is just an x64 issue??<br />
<br />
I will keep you guys posted....... thanks
