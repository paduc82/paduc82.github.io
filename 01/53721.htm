<h2>            Surface Pro &#40;LTE&#41; Battery Safety testing results or certificate</h2>
                    Hi I am trying to get hold of a safety test certificate for the batteries used in&nbsp;Surface Pro (LTE) in particular I need to know that these are tested and certified for safety on Aircraft so must meet the&nbsp;ICAO and IATA requirements. I have found this data
 sheet but require the actual certification and test report which apparently Microsoft are obliged to provide but noone can tell me how to get this data. The data sheet is
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=43388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and page 3 is the most relevant
                </div>

<p>Microsoft will probably not have that information.&nbsp; That usually comes from the manufacturer of the battery packs.&nbsp; This is the only information I could find on them:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>In regards to aviation in general, if you cannot find the information, the answer would be "NO, not certified".</p>

<p>Chances are, they are approved and the factory will have the certificates for them.&nbsp; Just about all of them go through a certification process for that approval.&nbsp; However, if the actual documentation cannot be located, it would have to be "NO" until they
 can prove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these actually get space tested because almost everything today relies on Li-ON batteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck in getting a reply, chances are, they do have on file the certification certificate.&nbsp; Generally needed for production.&nbsp; Ifixit had almost no information on them and they where the only one's with the pack listed.</p>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also working with Nick on this - thank you for your reply, that was a useful read. Our client is looking to use the Surface Pro LTEs as EFBs. I am aware that we need to obtain these certificates from the battery manufacturer as requested for by the
 CAA - though I do not know who the battery manufacturer is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do appreciate the help thank you.</p>

            When I looked on Ifixit's site, they mentioned "LitPO" but do not know if that is the maker or not.&nbsp; It was not mentioned.&nbsp; The picture of the battery packs did not display a name.&nbsp; You can look for that "LitPO" to see if a company exists of that name.&nbsp;
 No model number either for the packs.

<h2>            Tests of Surface Pro 3 on High Altitude, High Temp, and Military Grade &#43; Closure to Overheating &#38; Wifi&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Good afternoon,</span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for participating in these helpful discussions on the Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;</span></span><span>I have several items that I would like to
 ask about.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;Does Microsoft plan to continue to release updates to address the overheating and wifi issues as found in
<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/surface-pro-3-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/surface-pro-3-problems/</span></a>&nbsp;? In regards to the wifi, it appears that different users are having different issues,
 unlike the overheating which seems to be an issue that Microsoft is chipping away at and only affects some users. Should these issues deter me away from purchasing the SP3?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Has the Surface Pro 3 been tested at high altitude? How high and how does it handle it?
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Has Surface Pro 3 been tested at temperatures above 95 degrees? (India, for example)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Is the Surface Pro military grade certified?</p>
</li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you only know the answer to some of these questions, please feel free to provide the knowledge that you do have as answering any of the 4 questions will help me greatly in determining the reliability
 of this product. I am looking to deploy the SP3 to multiple employees.</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

<p><span>Kody</span></p>

            <p>im surprised nobody has found this. im trying to troubleshoot heating issues with my SP3. it currently idles at ~65c, but so does another laptop i have. i live in china, SP3 is new and has not had that much time to build up **** in it. the answers are only
 from my findings and experience</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. as far as i know the sp3 still experiences these issues. the heating issue as stated above, and also when i upgraded to win10, i started having wifi issue. i had to exchange it at bestbuy, because even they said there was nothing they could do about it.
 after a clean install, they seem to be happening much less, but still happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. i live in Xining China, bordering tibet. the altitude is ~7500ft. it funstions just fine except for the tempature issues which seem to stretch across devices. im thinking the thinner air here has something to do with it. but it does function for day to
 day actions, inc. photoshop and corel painter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. it should functin. the problem will be keepiong the device cool. usually temps level out at room tempature and if you are running it in 95 degree weather, it will run much hotter because its usiong hot air to try to cool it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. i dont think it is. i use an urban armor gear case for my sp3 which is military drop tested. their caseshave saved multiple devices of mine so its worth the investment imho</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope that helps</p>

<p><span><span>as you say you have no restore points try running a sfc /scannow command to attempt to fix any corrupted system files</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click<strong>All Programs</strong>, click
<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</li></ol>

    <title>Skype Number Not Receiving Callsh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morganstroyeck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Number Not Receiving Callsh</h2>
                    <p>On 8/15 I purchased and set up a Skype number to use for interview purposes while traveling internationally. I received a call just fine of 8/15, and it did not charge my credit as using a Skype number means I avoid that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today I hd an interview scheduled, and the interviewer was unable to reach me by calling my skype number (he tried using his office phone and Skype). I ended up having to call his mobile via Skype, and was subsequently charged for the call. I had
 a friend try to call my number, and still no call will come through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing? What would have changed in two weeks to now prevent me from receiving calls to my Skype number? Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!</p>

    <title>Using Hyper-v with a Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> .ven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Hyper-v with a Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>So, I'm using a Microsoft account on my Windows 10 PC and was trying to use Hyper-v. But whenever I try to connect to a vm, it says login failed and asks for my credentials which never works so I am unable to even install an OS on the vm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I realized that I can connect to the vm when I'm logged on with a local account no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for this to work with my current account? Or do I have to disconnect my account from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to see if disconnecting my Microsoft account and turn my profile into a local account did anything aaaannd....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get the logon failure prompt for password anymore but the connection still gets dropped and I still can't connect to the vm.</p>

<p>Thank you for inquiring. </p>
<p>I did not make any changes on my computer recently, but of course it does receive and install Windows updates every so often, which I can often see happening because they mess up my desktop icons arrangement&nbsp;(I wish they would correct this annoyance on the
 next release).</p>
<p>There was&nbsp; one recently, and when that happens I routinely run full Defender and Malwarebytes scans for peace of mind, and sometimes sfc/scannow (did it 3 days ago) but they (fortunately) always come out clear.
</p>
<p>The scanner (HP Photosmart 2610) worked fine as usual, but at on the last scan (right after one that worked well, i.e. page 1 of the same document), it could not save the newly&nbsp;scanned&nbsp; documents and generated the error 8,[8,106,0] labelled:</p>
<p>"An error has occurred saving the images to the chosen file location. Please make sure you have permission in the chosen file location".</p>
<p>Multiple attempts after rebooting the computer and the scanner yielded the same outcome.</p>
<p>After approximately 8 hours (yes eight) of research on the internet for possible solutions, (couldn't find any) and attempting several solutions on my end (running trouble shooters, updating the driver, running HP Scanner &amp; Printer Doctor, uninstalling all
 HP software and downloading &amp; reinstalling their latest versions) nothing worked.
</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk nowadays on self-driving cars and other gadgets of the sort that are about to be launched. Don't you find it very scary when we see how a simple laptop and a printer-scanner can still not&nbsp;be made to work reliably?</p>

<p>Thank you John, but as we all know, the manufacturer will not respond other than send us towards their own forum where people post many extravagant responses but seldom useful ones, sadly.
</p>
<p>In any case, for readers who may be interested, I accidentally found a solution to error 8,[8,106,0]: I discovered that the&nbsp;Defender anti-virus software on my computer had (mysteriously as always) turned on a feature named "Controlled Folder Access". Turning
 it off seems to have resolved the problem for me. ( open defender security center, go to Virus threat &amp; Protection, then virus &amp; threat protection settings, then scroll down to Controlled folder access and select off).
</p>
<p>I really wish one day Windows will finally issue a release that locks all settings unless specifically changed by the user. These sporadic and unannounced automatic changes in settings, which have plagued theses OS for decades now,&nbsp;make me and the people
 around me waste tremendous amounts of time each year, meaning big losses in productivity and health due to the frustration. Why are they built into it? It's really criminal to inflict such prejudice to people.

<span>I would be most suspicious of malware, run ADWcleaner and have a good antivirus program

</li><li>
I would remove all programs that claim to make your computer run better, safer or faster.&nbsp; The vast majority of these are in fact malware</li><li>
<span>I would remove any and all "protection" software on your computer and leave just one high quality Antivirus product -- More below...</span></li><li>
<span>I would be using my hard drive manufacturer's drive testing program to ensure it is not failing</span></li><li>
<span>I would want to be certain that none of the hard drives are more than 75% in use</span></li><li>
<span>I would check my memory using Windows 7's memory checker</span></li><li>
<span>I would install and run Autoruns to check to see what is in the start up process</span></li><li>
<span>AND, most importantly, take a close look at the applications installed.&nbsp; Some of them are notorious resource pigs that insist on running on startup.</span></li><li>
<span>I would remove programs/applications from&nbsp;startup unless I actually need them to startup</span></li></ol>

<span>Garmin Express</span></li><li>
<span>Skype</span></li><li>

<span>Some games, particularly online ones</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, this is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending
 on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I look after about 140 Windows PCs and have for over 13 years.&nbsp; Up until last September, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as
 any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Last September Symantec (owner of Norton) decided to no longer sell such a product.&nbsp; After a lot of research, I decided on Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp; I have installed it on over half those PCs so far and there
 has never been a problem.&nbsp; Actually I think it is a better product than even Norton.&nbsp; One of the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; It is also not expensive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My clients know well that if they install any "Internet Security" product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned very well the hard way that the other components in these IS products
 (other than the AV itself) caused more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; My problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS
 on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; I think the IS product is actually hiding the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Like I said.&nbsp; This is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical consumer
 Windows consumers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Something else that you should know:&nbsp; You can not fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a "removal tool" that gets the rest of
 it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and diagnose problems.</span></span></p>

    <title>Add Virtual Display for better TeamViewer resolution. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tirelantony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add Virtual Display for better TeamViewer resolution.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I need to remote into a server running Windows but with no monitor attached(no way that I can attach one). I want to be able to connect with a multi-platform remote controll software, because I'm running Linux. My problem is that TeamViewer(my software
 of choice) is running on a poor resolution and I can't change that. I did this "virtual display" trick multiple times on WIndows 7, by adding a non-existent display within control panel, but in Windows 10 I got stuck. I have Admin privilages, so I can insall
 any aditional software that you guys recommand. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Skype calls and privacy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redintifada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype calls and privacy</h2>
                    
<p>I just read this article (which now has a Microsoft response).&nbsp;http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/25/5143542/report-xbox-one-skype-upload-studio-users-banned-for-swearing</p>

<p>So can I confirm that the anti-swearing rules only apply for public communication not personal skype messages and that the people were banned due to public not private behaviour? Because that would be like getting a phone and then having your phone company
 censor your calls... it would be a breach of both privacy and customer service. Even if it is done by some bot that picks up individual words it is still a breach of privacy to have that reported somewhere else and and I wouldn't like to think that my phone
 company could just cut my phone because they don't like what I am saying.</p>

<p>Sure they have said they aren't listening in on calls. However there are other ways of doing it i.e. having bots set up... and yes sure your buddy can report you as abusive but it would be their word against yours. The message clarifies things to an extent
 but can we get confirmation that people aren't being banned for what is said in personal skype chats (regardless of if there is direct listening in or not)?</p>

<p>Pessoal o problema de perda de sincronismo ocorru comigo também. Não sei ao certo se depois de algum update mas só sei que ocorreu.</p>
<p>Após todos os tipos de testes, inclusive usando cabo USB, acionei o suporte da MS que propos a substituição do controle. Ontem recebi um controle novinho e fui correndo testar. Para minha surpresa o novo contorle não funcionou a não ser colado no aparelho.
 Portanto não se trata de defeito no controle. Deve ser algum defeito no console ou no software do One. Fogo que estou com o console parado sem poder jogar por conta disso. Precisamos de ajuda e atenção ao assunto pois muitas pessoas estao enfrentando esse
 problema. Tem um tópico no forum uol jogos com muitas páginas tratando disso.</p>

<h2>            Recently I&#39;ve been getting many BSODs and Werfault.exes popping up and closing application. Please help.</h2>
                    Recently I've been getting many WERFAULT.exes with Windows 7 which states that something or other couldn't be written to memory. This also closes applications, but it's not specific applications. From this I'm getting BSODs with relation to Kernel Power
 Event ID 41. It's stating on the BSOD "SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION" which from what I've read is related to the memory rather than for instance the drivers.<br />
Below is the link to the mini dump files and underneath that is the actual event details.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so. <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.memtest.org</span></a><br />
<br />
For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click -<br />
RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

===================================================================<br />
<br />
Norton/Symantec is known for causing strange issues and aggravating others. Best to<br />
uninstall it to test as merely disabling it will still allow pieces of it to install. Uninstall it and<br />
run the Norton Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants from being left behind.<br />
Below are recommendations to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x - Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove. <br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a> &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a> &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a><br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />

Hope this helps.

            Thanks, I already use Malwarebytes myself and after 6 or so scans with that and with ZoneAlarm and with Spybot there seems to be nothing wrong spyware/virus wise. I'm going to try the drivers solutions and memtest to see if it can detect it.

    <title>Windows 10 Computer Randomly Freezes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Computer Randomly  Freezes</h2>
                    <p>I am using a laptop that was upgraded to the free version of Windows 10. In the last couple of months, it has started freezing when using virtually any application. Here is what I know so far. When I do a shutdown (fast mode is enabled) or standby, then
 the laptop is prone to freezing after being turned back on. If a do a restart, then it is fine. The freezing usually happens several minutes after I've logged into the computer. In other words, the startup processes are finished loading well before freezing
 occurs. It also only occurs 90% of the time. There have been a few times where starting the computer after a shutdown or standby has been just fine. I can even have just one program running, and a freeze will still occur. Here are some programs that I have
 used in the past which have been halted by freezing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome</li><li>Microsoft Edge / Internet Explorer</li><li>Adobe Creative Cloud Programs</li><li>Microsoft Word 2016</li><li>Windows Explorer*</li><li>Having no programs open, but trying to open the start menu / searching in Cortana</li></ul>
<p>*Note: Windows Explorer always freezes anyways along with any other open programs, because the whole system quits responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Norton Antivirus, but that didn't help. I also only have Dell Update, Dell Audio, Dell Touchpad, and Intel Rapid Storage Technology as the startup programs. I already tried disabling all other startup processes.
 What is going on here? The only conclusion that I can come up with is that some Windows process and/or update is to blame. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this.</p>

    <title>Screensaver Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jclyens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screensaver Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
I was wondering if there is any possibility to customize screensaver a bit more than it actually is, using built-in tools. I always wanted to make a screensaver like Tony Stark had with his hot rod, but after collecting some photos I realized that Windows 10
 has no "fade" option. So there's a question:<br />
<br />
Is there any possibiliy to make this effect? Do I have to install something so I could customize by myself and save a screensaver theme as a file, what tool do you recommend?<br />
<br />
I'm glad to read a solution, because it looks really cool when you got some nice cars slideshow fading away.<br />
<br />
Have a good day!

            Thanks for useless reply.<br />
<br />
I found the solution by myself of course. The only thing you got to do is to install Windows Live Photo Gallery from Essentials by Microsoft. I'm not sure about WinSATScore DWORD value in registry but anyone who was looking after it there you go:<br />
<br />
<div style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows Live \ Photo Gallery \ Slideshow</div>
<p style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">
Right-click on the key (Slideshow) , and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value, and name it as&nbsp;<strong>WinSATScore<br />
</strong>Put there 300 or higher and close it.<br />
<br />
That should work, for me it does and it's fine.<br />

 before this happened. For example, Facebook doesn't load properly formatted in Microsoft Edge, or not at all in Chrome. Messenger opens on start up which it should not because I've had it turned off for a very long time. I've tried updating drivers, updating

            This looks like the computer is trying to boot from LAN. You might have to disable LAN booting from BIOS settings.

            Hi msuserYD, you seem to ha have 3 problems . . .
<br />
<br />1, Your system is trying to boot from a network drive (PXE Boot):
<br />   Boot your system into BIOS
<br />   Change the boot order, so your hard drive is top of the Boot Order List
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Perform a System Restore if Available:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, then Press Shift whilst clicking Restart - it will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />3. Your initial issue (dxgkrnl.sys) is caused by a bad video driver - try rolling ack your video driver if you get this error again . . .       
        </p>

            System does seem to booting from PXE. If I hit Escape two times, it skips this when booting. I have tried going in to change order but do not find a way to do this.

 do I name it, so computer will boot properly?

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
We've noticed that the post become idle while you're still working with the issue. Could you let us know if you were able to resolve it these past days?<br />
<br />
If not, and if we would base on your previous reply, it shows that you're in the right track. However, it is no longer required for you to add any boot resource. You just have to rearrange the
<strong>Boot Order</strong>. For to continue, we need to see what you can see on your BIOS/UEFI screen, the one under the Boot Tab. Please provide a screenshot.
<br />
<br />
You will not be able to use the Sniping Tool or Print screen button here. you may use your phone's camera to take a shot of it, and post it on your next reply.
<br />
<br />
