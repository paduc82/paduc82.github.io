<h2>            My Windows 10 Computer is Not Recognizing My Microphone</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Lenovo PC. I am using a BM-800 microphone. I have looked pretty much everywhere for a solution. My computer is not registering my microphone. I have scanned for devices, and done troubleshooting (I think it was the right category?) In
 fact, when I plug it in the Dolby audio pops up, so it seems that it is being recognized as headphones. This has only been a recent problem: a bit more than a week ago, I submitted an audition for a voice acting job and got in. They said my mic quality was
 superior. Now, it is not showing up on my computer, and I have lines I need to send in. (Sorry about that extra info.) When I listen to playback to see where the sound is coming from, it is the mic on my computer and not my actual mic. I have restarted my
 computer, updated my recording programs and my Windows version. I just tried my mic on my iPad, so I know it's not the actual microphone that's the problem.
</p>
<p>I looked for a driver, but couldn't find it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that it is a windows update that has messed with my devices or something?</p>
<p>Is there something else you think I can do?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>

            Hi Reyna.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi Sudarshan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've discovered that I still have access to the traditional desktop version of&nbsp;remote desktop in Windows RT. I am able to run mstcs.exe /Admin and log onto the console session the way I normally would have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not change the fact that the App version of Remote Desktop needs this option as well. For now I'll have to use&nbsp;the desktop version instead.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t start up on Vista&#59; errors 0x800705b4 &#38; 0x800106ba, can anyone help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Windows Vista Ultimate Pro and Windows Defender worked fine until Verizon had me install it's Backup Assistant. Now I can't get Windows Defender to start up. I originally received an 0x800705b4 error, but now just keep getting an 0x800106ba error
 every time I try to start it up. I went to the Internet to find a solution and this is the one I thought might work:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom McC: "I had same problem. Fixed by going to control pannel-administrative tools - services - select Windows Defender-right click for properties-choose startup options and select automatic. Restart and no problems since."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I opened&nbsp;the Control Panel, I didn't have the options&nbsp;Tom McC says. Besides that in Vista&nbsp;it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open the Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Open System &amp; Maintenance</p>
<p>3. Open Administrative Tools</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, once there, there is no option to choose Windows Defender or&nbsp;ANY of my start-up programs. Furthermore, when I tried to right-click it all I&nbsp;got was a drop-down menu that said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Explore (Which showed only Administrative Tools programs/apps)</p>
<p>2. Open (Which showed the Administrative Tools programs in the C drive tree)</p>
<p>3. Win-Zip&nbsp;(Which allows me to&nbsp;zip&nbsp;files in the Administrative Tools and/or&nbsp;those within it)</p>
<p>4. New (Which allows me&nbsp;to create a new&nbsp;Folder or Briefcase within Administrative&nbsp;Tools)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So&nbsp;that's why I've come here. I'm totally stumped and need all the help I can get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>"and Windows Defender worked fine until Verizon had me install ....."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have an Antivirus installed; which is a necessity?</p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is the advice to turn it back on.</p>
<p>Are you sure your Computer does not have any Malware, as you do not mention using an Antivirus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defender (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to now&nbsp;change Startup Programs in Vista without using Defender, use either of these Methods:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For the last two days i hit a brick wall on trying to solve out the ''error''. Every time I try to right-click a file on the desktop OR on any of the hard drives (C,E,F) i always get a short blue screen and then the desktop appears back. Can you please help
 me solve this? I really need the right-click option because of my work.</p>

            Hi. Already did method 1 and 2. The spooler needs to be working in order to install drivers, which weree never deleted. This is a Brother printer which works fine, even reinstalled the software for it.

<h2>            Upgrading Windows 8 x86 to x64</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a retail DVD of Windows 8 pro/32 bit back in January, and now I would like to&nbsp;'upgrade' to&nbsp;the 64 bit version to take advantage of my system's higher RAM capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is this: Assuming that I can access a legit 64 bit install DVD, can I use my original (x86)&nbsp;key to activate the x64 version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

As noted, if you bought a retail box copy, you should have the 64 bit copy already, if purchased it online, you will have to download the 64 bit copy.</p>

How to obtain 64 bit Windows 8 installation files.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>For Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 users</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free tool called CPU-Z</a>. You can download it here. Once you have it installed, double click it and it will scan your system. Click the CPU tab and look in the
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable.</p>
<p>If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application
 compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems. </p>
<p>Does your system meet all the requirements? Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are
 using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider upgrading and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.
</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows 8 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which should work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt
 try fixing it might just apply in this case. </p>
<p><strong>Backup, Backup, Backup</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 8 64 bit. Yes,
 that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.
</p>
<p>The best way to handle some of the migration chores is by using the built in Windows Easy Transfer utility (specifically) for Windows 7 users. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows XP, make sure you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the free Windows Easy Transfer utility</a>, install it and create a backup of your personal files and settings. Lets take a look at doing that.</p>

</p>
<p>You have a few options to choose from, the best one would be an external hard disk which is excellent for storing large amounts of information. If you don‚Äôt have an external hard disk, you can save your backup to a network share if one is available.

<p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>

<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>
<p><strong>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</strong></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a retail DVD of Windows 8 pro/32 bit back in January, and now I would like to&nbsp;'upgrade' to&nbsp;the 64 bit version to take advantage of my system's higher RAM capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is this: Assuming that I can access a legit 64 bit install DVD, can I use my original (x86)&nbsp;key to activate the x64 version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<b>Don't forget that all retail disks with windows 8 are upgrade disks. The only full win 8 version is the OEM System Builder version only available from some online retailers. You have to reinstall your original windows first to upgrade to the 64 bit version
 using the 64 bit upgrade dvd. You might consider staying with the 32 bit version.</b>

            Thanks for the input,<br />
<br />
Apparently, I've got the OEM version with just one DVD. I originally 'upgraded' from XP to 8, so this is definitely a full version DVD.<br />
<br />
I know about the system requirements, and that it will require a complete re-install, including my programs. I'm actually a student (BS-I.T. with full access to dreamspark), and want to upgrade to x64 to take advantage of my Phenom II x6 CPU and my mobo's 16Gb
 RAM capacity to set up a couple of VM's for class labs, so in my case I think the effort would pay off in the end.<br />
<br />
I can download Windows 8 pro from dreamspark, but I'm not sure if I would get the x64 version, since I'm currently running an x86 OS. I'm also not sure if I could use my original key with that download - or if it would matter. I've heard that the downloads
 from dreamspark 'expire' after a couple of years, so I'm hesitant to install that as my production OS.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>Hi my dell 6410 laptop was scheduled to upgrade last night. After 2 hours I checked on it and the window "Hi Welcome back" was up. A "Next" button was available, but i had no curser and keyboard wouldn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to restart with the on button but now the laptop won't start at all, it's just stuck in a loop not launching windows. I can't select safe mood or anything since it's not starting for me. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you upgrade to Windows 10 - Windows Update or with Media Creation tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that&nbsp;your system is stuck in a loop. In this case, I would suggest you to hard reboot the system by pressing and holding the power button until the system shuts down. Power on the system after 3-4 minutes and check if you are able to boot
 successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then you might have to boot from the installation media and run a Startup repair.
<span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page to create media:

            <p>Hi again,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your answer. I have managed to create an installation Usb stick and have tried your suggestion above, but it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i upgraded from my free download from previously running windows 7 pre installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried all options in the advanced settings on the reboot menu, but none work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my windows 10 was never successfully up and running after my first attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am currently trying to "Go back to the previous build" since it was the only thing I could do in reboot menu, hoping my old windows 7 will work again. It's been spinning on "restarting..." for 6 hours so far. How long should this take? &nbsp;<br />

<p>************** JIT Debugging **************</p>
<p>To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this</p>
<p>application or computer (machine.config) must have the</p>
<p>jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.</p>
<p>The application must also be compiled with debugging</p>
<p>enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>

    <title>8.1 Alarms app has no alarm sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            8.1 Alarms app has no alarm sound</h2>
                    I previously used the alarm app and it worked fine.&nbsp; I tried to use it again and there's no alarm sound&nbsp;and there's no&nbsp;red&nbsp;popup in the upper right corner of the desktop.&nbsp; It set up okay and played the sound when choosing which one to use.&nbsp; I retested
 by choosing the alarm to come on ONCE.&nbsp; I checked the alarm&nbsp;set up after it was supposed to go off.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was OFF because it pasted the time I set it for.&nbsp; There's a notice at the top of the set up screen&nbsp;saying&nbsp;"Notifications will only show if PC is awake".&nbsp;
 The computer isn't set on sleep.&nbsp; When I go to the Start screen to log out&nbsp;the Power Options are&nbsp;SLEEP, SHUT DOWN, or RESTART.&nbsp; I never put it on&nbsp;SLEEP and all the settings for SLEEP are set to Never.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us more about your concern. You said that it worked before, when was the last that you were able to use the alarm? What changes have been made to your device since then? We are also quite lost with your experiment. Can you set up an alarm in 2 or 3
 minutes from now and observe if it will work? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification on the Alarm app was just a reminder that if your device was put to sleep, the alarm will not work. This is likely to be caused by your device not supporting InstantGo. As long as your device is turned on by the time your alarm is about
 to go off. It should be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

            There has been no changes made to the computer except for Windows updates.&nbsp; I used it last maybe a year ago.&nbsp; When I set it up yesterday I had set it up to go off everyday.&nbsp; I noticed the time I set it up for went past and no alarm went off.&nbsp; My experiment
 was to check to see if the function was working but just not the sound.&nbsp; When you set the "Occurrence" for every day the setting stays "On", that's the little circle at the bottom of the set up.&nbsp; So I set the alarm to be used "Once" so I could see it if the
 setting went to "Off" after it reached the time I set it for because it was not a recurring setting.&nbsp; It did.&nbsp; Which tells me the actual function of the of the app is working but not the sound.&nbsp; Your request of setting up an alarm to go off in 2 or 3 minutes
 I did several times before I put this post up.

<p>I&nbsp;turned the computer&nbsp;on today and set an alarm again and it works!&nbsp; Maybe the program didn't load correctly before.&nbsp; I don't think I did anything different.&nbsp; Thanks for your advice.&nbsp; I think the commands you have here may come in handy for other problems
 that may pop up.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not to mention they're ¬£500 million in debt.&nbsp; I dunno how they keep managing to spend money in the transfer market especially since they don't sell much.<br />

<p>Hi Rushi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver issues can be one of the reasons why you're having issues with adjusting the brightness. To isolate your concern, we would like to ask for the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes or updates installed on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest starting your computer in<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> safe mode</a>.
 This will start Windows using a limited set of drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post back, and we'll assist you further.</p>

<h3> rival-rivera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Sysprep.exe &#34;Generalized Out of Box Expierance&#34; Re-validate my Licence of Windows 7 on the original motherboard</h2>
                    I had bought my self a new motherboard to replace the prebuilt one I have<br />
<br />
and had to use the Sysprep.exe to get it to boot on the new motherboard<br />
<br />
However I didn't know this will cause my Windows&nbsp;licence&nbsp;to become invalid<br />
To avoid buying a new Licence, can I use Sysprep.exe to Resintall the HDD back on to the old board and will it ReValidate Windows&nbsp;Licence.
<div>The old board will be using a&nbsp;different&nbsp;CPU however</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Point being is I'm using the old parts of the&nbsp;original&nbsp;computer and others to build a computer for my girlfriend<br />
<br />
if she is going to have the&nbsp;original&nbsp;board, Can I just Give this HDD and buy my self a new Copy of Windows for my self</div>
<div>because i think that would be the cheaper route then buying Her a copy of windows and my Self a new&nbsp;licence<br />
<br />
Or do I have to now buy a Licence for this copy of windows now that I did the Sysprep.exe OOBE?<br />

You can give the old hard disk to your girl friend(Note: She has to activate the operating system again). However, you need to make sure that the same product key is not used in another computer. If it is in use, you will get a message that you are a victim
 of software counterfeit. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            Hi IanCollier2,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />That's how it should be, the white dot inside the green circle means that they were recently active and not they're active at that moment. 
<br />
<br />Please take a look at this to know more about it.

    <title>Unable to print PDFs in windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giraffe 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to print PDFs in windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for help to solve why My Hp Stream 13 a 32GB netbook with windows 8.1 has suddenly stopped printing PDFs files? The printer is recognised and when I press print the o icon starts but then disappears. The printer icon appears in the task bar
 but the associated window states no documents to print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot think of anything I may have done recently to change any relevant settings. My printer is an Epson wifi type. I can print other documents ok. I also have a Toshiba Laptop from which PDFs can be printed through the same wifi printer no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone reading this who may have some idea what could be the problem, if so I will be pleased to here from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p><strong>Question: How do I disable the Auto Sync feature in my software????</strong></p>
