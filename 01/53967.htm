            <p>It depends, if you have a full Windows 10 Pro retail license yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had originally upgraded from a retail Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to the Windows 10 free upgrade, yes, you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled with your computers motherboard, what is known as a an OEM license, then you cannot.

 to Transfer your Windows 10 License to a New Computer</span></span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>More details:</p>
<p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            Periodic Kernel_Data_INPAGE_ERROR whats causing this</h2>
                    <p>We have a touch screen POS system the pc is an ELO TOUCH screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are 3 of the dmp files:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Asd-lq6BMuG6oAyaPVUo3Sqsqu2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/u/s!Asd-lq6BMuG6oAyaPVUo3Sqsqu2q</a>&nbsp;it is zipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens sporatically and the distributor says it is a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We ran windows defender, AVG anti virus, Rkill, JRT, Malware Bytes and Norton NPE which all came back with no viruses.</p>
<p>We have a support contract with them, however, they seem to claim it is not their equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is this is either the hard drive or the ram, however, this machine was installed in October 2017.&nbsp; Apparently Brand new out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a screenshot to attach but here is the error in full.</p>

<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen,<br />
restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow<br />
these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.<br />
If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer<br />
for any Windows updates you might need.<br />
<br />
If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware<br />
or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.<br />
If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart<br />
your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then<br />
select Safe Mode.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having some broken system files are the usual cause why Kernel_Data_INPAGE_ERROR occurs to a Windows computer. We appreciate you providing us a detailed information about your concern. We have read the DMP files that you've included in your post, however,
 the information that was extracted from the DMP files were incomplete. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to specifically determine if a hardware or software error is causing the issue, we would need you to reproduce the DMP file. You can use this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/bsod-finding-and-fixing-them/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">link</a></strong> as a reference on how to find and upload DMP files. We suggest following the steps under
 How to find and upload the files to us for analysis and The procedure for finding and uploading the DMP files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p><span>We appreciate your response. Upon reading your logs, it shows that your computer has multiple concerns like an infection on the system, which has corrupted system files. To further troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you&nbsp;create a test user profile.
 Follow these steps </span><span>to create a test user profile</span><span>: </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Using Cortana search, type Settings and then hit the Enter key. </span>
</li><li><span>In the Settings window, select Accounts. </span></li><li><span>Select Family &amp; other people. </span></li><li><span>Choose Add someone else to this PC. </span></li><li><span>Click I don't have this person's sign-in information. </span></li><li><span>Click Add a user without a Microsoft account. </span></li><li><span>Name the user as TEST and then provide a password. </span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Using the test user account, that is where you'll be removing the infection on your computer. With the scanners to run, you can refer to this
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning-windows_other/list-of-malware-removal-tools/d824b9af-ebd8-4c47-94e2-8ee6c544c100"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">article</span></strong></a><span>. After removing
 the malware infection, it will be best to perform a repair upgrade. Doing so can repair the damaged system files. This
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">article</span></strong></a><span> published
 by Andre Da Costa provides further information on how to perform a Repair Upgrade Using the Windows 10 ISO file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us updated about the status of your concern.</span></p>

<p>Is your system an Elo All-in-One or is it a Posiflex PS-3315 or something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is the distributor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything in particular you can do to make the system crash and if so what would that be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your crash dump from 10/27 implicates:<br />
</p>
<p>ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) 0xc000000e - A device which does not exist was specified.<br />
</p>
<p>DISK_HARDWARE_ERROR: There was error with disk hardware<br />
BUGCHECK_STR:&nbsp; 0x7a_c000000e</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your crash dump from 12/10 implicates:</p>
<p>ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) 0xc000000e - A device which does not exist was specified.<br />
DISK_HARDWARE_ERROR: There was error with disk hardware<br />
BUGCHECK_STR:&nbsp; 0x7a_c000000e<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your crash dump from 12/28 implicates:</p>
<p>ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) 0xc000000e - A device which does not exist was specified.<br />
DISK_HARDWARE_ERROR: There was error with disk hardware<br />
BUGCHECK_STR:&nbsp; 0x7a_c000000e<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see a pattern?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I live on the planet called Earth and on my planet Windows Embedded does not come with Cortana so I don't know how far you will be getting with those instructions from the Microsoft engaged "expert".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And hopefully the Microsoft engaged "expert" will tell us how to detect and repair "some broken system files".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I don't see how from the crash dump files the Microsoft engaged "expert" can determine that there are "multiple concerns like an infection on the system which has corrupted system files".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my planet I'm pretty sure that creating a new user profile will not magically cure a system infection or magically uncorrupt system files (but I am not an "expert").</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not hurt to run some malware scans so you could go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And on my planet you can't use a Windows 10 ISO to repair a Windows Embedded system but you can sure try and let us know how that works out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system is still under warranty you could tell the distributor that your crash dump files were analyzed and they all indicate a problem with the disk hardware or it's subsystem and if they don't know how to read crash dump files they need to find and
 hire somebody that can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this knowledge of the crash dump file analysis the distributor may want to run some non destructive diagnostics on your system or maybe just swap out the hard drive or entire system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also ask your distributor if the are so sure the problem is a virus what virus removal tools do they suggest you run to remove it and if what they suggest is in the list of things you have already run, tell them about that and what do they suggest
 next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a basic check (which is not a test) of your hard drive status you can download and install the free version of Speccy from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.piriform.com/speccy</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you run Speccy there is a Storage section that will tell you the SMART status of your hard drive(s):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bb26f8f-39a0-49e3-ac61-841bb4dfd8b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bb26f8f-39a0-49e3-ac61-841bb4dfd8b3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All Green is good and if there is a single SMART error you are not going to be able to fix it - you need to replace the hard drive as it is going to fail sooner or later.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Speccy File menu you can choose Publsih Snapshot and get a link to a URL about your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a8bc5f7-3d2e-4795-9b14-7120a1996d78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a8bc5f7-3d2e-4795-9b14-7120a1996d78" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In a subsequent reply you come back and paste that link (Ctrl-V)and we can look at that and find out more about the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more recent crash dumps you can upload them for more analysis.</p>

            Thank you for your input. I checked and preformed the operations mentioned in the thread you sent. None of them did anything for me.<br />
I still get "A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting" for almost all the troubleshooting links. the error code still remains<br />
the same as mentioned above for all the troubleshooting links.<br />
Thank you again,<br />

I get this, too.&nbsp; Only when logged in as domain user.&nbsp; Local user works.&nbsp; I've looked through global policy but I nothing is configured for troubleshooting.&nbsp; Supposedly, not configured means it should work.</p>

<p>Hi! I did nothing to the computer--this happened when I went in the other room for a few minutes. When I returned there was only the ethernet icon showing. Wireless had vanished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps: network troubleshooter, reset network, ran computer updates, in device manager found Network adapters: Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller and unclicked the "allow computer to turn off this device to save power" just in case the cause
 had been related to a low battery issue, but when I restarted the computer all the other adapters previously listed were gone. So I re-clicked it, restarted, and now they have not returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hesitant to reboot the whole computer because I have loads of work on programs like MAXQDA and others and those programs will be lost. I am not sure how to do it, but there is a way roll back just to the time before this happened although that would
 mean losing all my work since then. I can try saving onto thumbdrive whatever I can first if this rollback is the best option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Did you obtain the latest version of the driver through the manufacturer's website? In this case, considering that there were no recent changes made that might have caused the issue and we've already tried the possible solutions from this

</p><p>Yes, I downloaded the proper driver and installed it. &nbsp;It does not show up under Network adapters, but I discovered through a tab to expose hidden drivers that it is indeed there; however, this message appears: Currently this hardware device is not connected

<p>Thank you for the update, Kathleen. This error occurs when Windows fails to recognize the hardware device connected to the system. Run through the recommended solutions below and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Scan and Repair Hard Disk Corruption</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box, type <strong>Command </strong>and press <strong>Ctrl </strong>
+ <strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Type <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Check Disk will begin scanning for possible hard disk corruption.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above solutions worked, you might be facing this issue because of a faulty hardware. Going to a technician and getting it repaired or replaced is recommended.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we can help you with anything else, let us know.</p>

            Hi Victoria.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are changes in Sticky Notes in Verson 1903.  Find Sticky Notes in the All Apps list in Start menu to open and move the list (now synced via OneDrive) onto the desktop.  
<br />
<br />If you're getting .dll errors then report back the exact error text so I can help you figure out which program (which is revealed by the .dll itself, e.g. Logi.dll is Logitech Updater, etc.  so that it can be reset, repaired or reinstalled. 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jeff.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options - to run System Restore to a point before the problem began.
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  This link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br /> 
<br />5) You can also run the PC's Factory Recovery from it's hotkey at boot, following the procedure for that model found in it's Manual on it's Support Downloads webpage, or by asking Google how to Factory Recover the exact make and model.  
<br />
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    My Windows Vista SP2 keeps auto minimizing my fullscreen games and when i try to maximize them, it minimizes them after like 2-3 seconds, it has become impossible to play a game. Thi does not account for all of my games, only a few games wich comes from
 entirely different producers, so I know it is a problem with my Vista.

 did it last work fine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step1</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>Update display drivers in addition to these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open<strong>&nbsp;Windows Update</strong> by clicking the&nbsp;
<strong>Start </strong>button. In the search box, type &nbsp;<strong>Update</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click &nbsp;<strong>Windows Update.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the link that tells you optional updates are available. (If you don't see this link, it means Windows Update didn't find any updates
 for your computer.)</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the driver you want to install, click<strong>&nbsp; OK,</strong> and then click &nbsp;<strong>Install updates.</strong>&nbsp; If you're prompted
 for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:<br />
</span></strong><span>If Windows Update doesn't locate an updated driver, you can search the manufacturer's support website, where companies sometimes publish new drivers before making
 them available to Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the manufacturer‚Äôs website and download the latest updated drivers for the Display Adapter and install and check.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I got answer on Japanese community.</p>
<p>When I install Japanese fonts and edit registry value of SegoeUI on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontLink\SystemLink&nbsp;</p>
<p>as below -move Japanese font name to before of Chinese font name- then could see Japanese Font Shape from Japanese Font -Meiryo.</p>

            <p>Hi, Tac.Kane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're on an English Windows 10 system and your preference for East Asian characters is to see Japanese glyphs, then you may want to include Japanese in your profile language settings (particularly if you want to be able to type in Japanese), or you may
 want to install optional Japanese fonts without changing your language settings. Either will add additional Japanese fonts and will provide the experience I think you're looking for. The following topic includes information on adding a language into your profile
 or just adding an optional font feature:</p>

<h2>            Importing and Exporting of mails from default Mail client in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am using Windows 10 and I configured an account in the default mail client provided using active sync. Since I have challenges in the server space, I want to export certain mails out of the account as well as to import back as an when required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While browsing, I got few tips, but all of them were not practical in Windows 10 mail, as I am not able to locate file menu, which had options to import and export mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As I am connecting to a domino server, I am looking for a temporary solution to move emails out of the mail box and later bring it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I don't have a VPN connectivity, to archive old files also outlook access is restricted by the server.

</p><p>Looking forward to a solution which can move the mails out of my mail box and bring it back later.</p>

<p><strong>Right now I have windows XP Professional installed on my computer. I want to switch to Windows 7, but there is no upgrade option; only clean install.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The issue is, I need to keep all my programs installed and running. I am on a school provided laptop and the programs are not accessible, therefore I cant reinstall them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If I select the "upgrade" option when installing Vista, will all my programs I have right now still be installed, and still run properly? I know if I have vista, I will be able to upgrade to 7 (again, hopefully keeping all programs installed...?)</strong></p>

 and everything, but I can't use windows for more than 5 minutes without it crashing with either a Unexpected_kernel_mode_trap error or a Irql_not_less_or_equal error. I've tried running memtest (no errors found), driver verifier (which didn't identify a driver)
 and reinstalling windows multiple times. None of these solutions helped, can anyone tell what's wrong?</span><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Link to your minidump leads to an error message at OSR. And on a new home build the issue is almost always hardware. Further indications are the re-installs did not help and that driver verifier found nothing.<br />
<br />
Finding and correcting hardware issues at home can be very challenging since there usually is limited "known good" parts to swap in and out.<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power. Then carefully remove the cards one at time and put them&nbsp; back in their slots. Do the same for the memory and then the cables. A loose or&nbsp;corroded connection point can cause strange issues.<br />
<br />
Be sure you have the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, firmware (for SSD and others), and updated major drivers. New hardware almost always comes with out-of-date firmware and drivers.<br />
<br />
Reduce the system down to as simple as possible including memory to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Just to be sure :<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible <br />
even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed <br />
in system behind slower&nbsp; memory. <strong>So it is best to also swap sticks in and out
</strong><br />
<strong>to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.</strong><br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- Use this</strong><strong> method<br />

IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)
An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.  This is usually
caused by drivers using improper addresses.
If a kernel debugger is available get the stack backtrace.
Arguments:
Arg1: 0000000000000003, memory referenced
Arg2: 00000000000000ff, IRQL
Arg3: 0000000000000000, bitfield :
	bit 0 : value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
	bit 3 : value 0 = not an execute operation, 1 = execute operation (only on chips which support this level of status)
Arg4: fffff80366d6151c, address which referenced memory

However your post of&nbsp; it and the previous description both point to hardware.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Nothing of note in the minidumps so I still think it is hardware.<br />
<br />
You are running an older version of Windows 10 though that is not likely related.<br />
Windows 10 Kernel Version 14393 MP<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 0906<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 03/22/2017<br />
SystemSKU = SKU<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = STRIX Z270E GAMING<br />
BaseBoardVersion = Rev 1.xx<br />
CPUID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7600K CPU @ 3.80GHz"<br />
MaxSpeed:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3800<br />

            Hi Paul, 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Remove any devices plugged into your system
<br />
<br />Start your System again
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this issue:
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>I tried too. I explain, I've a Xbox One and downloaded yet Dirt3 and others games of One, but i can't download Dhngeon Siege 3. I tried on Xbox store but i can't, i tired on consolle but i can't because DS3 is only bundle. What can i do? A lot of friends
 downloaded it and Microsoft support don't know why somebodies has trouble and somebodies don't have. What answer is this? The only sure thing is that I haven't DS3.
</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, I hope you can me help </p>

And they can access website through that proxy settings in windows 7. <br />
Now i installed windows 8 and joined a workstation in my domain. Setup all proxy settings like windows 7 proxy settings by local administrator.
<br />
Local administrator can access websites through proxy but domain users cannot access webite through proxy settings. Error says
<b>"website is online but not responding to connection attempts"</b>. I already disable my workstations firewall.<br />
Note that i add all domain user in local pc's administrator group.<br />
Now what can i do to access website through proxy by a domain user?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

                    What is going on? I can not enter any system folders such as system config, device manager and cmd.exe. They all give the error "Data of this type is not supported". It only happened in the last 2 weeks and it is driving me mad. The last time I used either
 or all of these was about a month ago when I do my monthly driver updates and stop startup programs etc. I can't even do a system restore.

<p>There are several ways to skin the System Restore cat. One consists using the System Repair CD (which you get a friend to burn for you) to boot the machine into Repair Mode.</p>

    <title>Desktop PC with Windows 10. Sleep and Shut-Down worked fine till - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonio ginnelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop PC with Windows 10. Sleep and Shut-Down worked fine till recently October 2015</h2>
                    <p>I was very happy with sleep mode in Windows 10. It worked well it would sleep my PC after my set 30 minutes and awaken it in seconds right back where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have a brand new PC BTW with WD Blue 1tb HDD.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now two issues have recently appeared and I cannot find how to fix them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) When my PC goes into sleep mode and I try to wake it up, the HDD starts but the system and PC wont start up. I have to turn off and on the actual power supply switch and then hit the START button and it launches.</p>
<p>(2) When I put the PC to SHUT DOWN - it shuts down OK - - -BUT it immediately restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's driving me nuts. I have been poking around issues and problem postings and I see many issues with sleep. My hassle is that it all worked well till a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hans anyone similar issues - and has anyone got a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Hi Aswin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and suggestions.</p>
<p>I did as you suggested.</p>
<p>The trouble shooter for - Power - gave the following result after the fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen saver enables - NOT FIXED (not sue what that means - I have been running a theme all along)</p>
<p>Time before HD sleeps too long - FIXED</p>
<p>Time before Display sleeps too long - FIXED</p>
<p>Time before PC sleeps too long - FIXED</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I had set 30min and 60 min respectively </p>
<p>The fix reset to 10mins and 30mins)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then manually put the PC to sleep to test . </p>
<p>
</p><p>The sleep process was different from what I had been seeing last couple of months. There appeared to be a two step process - where after initial HDD disc off - it did what I thought was going for a re-start. Finally it shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it went to sleep - all the lights on the from of the PC went off - all along the power lamp would stay flashing and the HD activity LED would stay partially lit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pressed the Power Sw to wake the PC - it woke up BUT it did as if it was a full restart. When the system was up - it was not functional - the task bar icons were missing and the system not responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did a hard power switch off and re-started and the system came back to normal - wheich is why I can now communicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All very strange?</p>

            <p>Hi again Aswin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did another manual command sleep through the "start" menu and Power = sleep .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed that as it was about to reach sleep or what I would previously have noticed as a sleep state - the HDD made an accessing sound and there was a re-spin and some activity of the HDD for a couple of seconds before it turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it left the Power light partially lit - I did a press to awaken and the HDD spun up but nothing else happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off at the Power Switch and back on and hit the power button to get a totally normal boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is totally normal activity of the HDD in all other respects - it is only a couple of months old like the rest of the PC desktop so I am not thinking faulty HDD.</p>
<p>

            <p>3rd Report - sorry for the overload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole power management seems to have gone mad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reverted to closing down all operations - and hitting the power supply switch. It seems the only way to properly power off at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The power on and startup using this way - is a full boot- up - it takes a bit longer - but there is no funny business or funny HDD activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope this is a software and settings issue and a fix can be found.</p>

            <p>Thanks Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reset the power plan later - for the moment I will just use the power supply switch as this gives me a hassle free shut down and a straightforward boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW The link you sent for Power Plans - is redundant - just refers you on to a general menu.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, I reset the power plan as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC now goes into sleep more normally - without the second kick-back by the HDD - HOWEVER, it will not awaken on the power button after it's sleep, the HDD spins up but nothing more happens - I then have to hit the power supply button off and on, followed
 by the Power Button - -&nbsp; only after that system launches back to where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me the Power Management software needs a bit of a re-write.</p>

            <p>Report 3 to Ramesh Kumar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC entered sleep. </p>
<p>It powered down and spun down HDD - then the HDD did a spin-up which lasted about 4 seconds and went to shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN the system restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said the only reliable way I have of turning on or off the PC is via the Mains switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating. I am wondering if my migration from W7 to W10 might have some conflicting software operating in the power area that got accidentally triggered at some stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feel very retro using the mains power to turn on or off the PC - not to mention annoying.</p>

            <p>Still having to use the Mains Power Switch as the only reliable **** of turning the PC off or on. When it goes into sleep I have to turn off at the mains to get a re-boot.</p>

<h2>            Tu cuenta tiene un cumplimiento activo&#63;</h2>
                    <p>El mejor sitio para verificar tu cuenta suspendida o vetada, incluso consolas, es en enforcement.xbox.com ah√≠ puedes realizar una revisi√≥n. C√≥mo hacerlo?</p><p><br /></p>¬øQu√© es la revisi√≥n de casos?

<p>De revisi√≥n de casos es una herramienta que permite a los jugadores que han recibido una acci√≥n de cumplimiento (por ejemplo, una suspensi√≥n de la cuenta o cambiar nombre de jugador forzada) para tener su aplicaci√≥n revisado por un miembro de la Pol√≠tica y Aplicaci√≥n del equipo de Xbox Live.&nbsp;Las suspensiones no son emitidos a la ligera, pero de revisi√≥n de casos permite a los miembros de Xbox Live para interactuar directamente con XBLPET y obtener una mayor comprensi√≥n de la aplicaci√≥n y por qu√© se tomaron medidas.&nbsp;En el caso muy poco frecuente que la revisi√≥n determina que se cometi√≥ un error o la aplicaci√≥n no era necesario, se tomar√°n las medidas necesarias para remediar la situaci√≥n.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

¬øQui√©n puede presentar una revisi√≥n del caso?

<p>Cualquier miembro de Xbox Live con una acci√≥n</p>

<ul><li>La duraci√≥n de la aplicaci√≥n es mayor de 24 horas de duraci√≥n</li><li>La aplicaci√≥n fue emitido en los √∫ltimos 12 meses</li></ul>

<p>S√≥lo se puede solicitar una revisi√≥n de sus propias acciones de aplicaci√≥n activos, y debe ser firmado en la cuenta de que recibi√≥ la aplicaci√≥n (o iniciar sesi√≥n en la cuenta del padre si se suspende una cuenta secundaria).&nbsp;Antes de presentar una revisi√≥n del caso, se le puede solicitar que complete una breve cuestionario dise√±ado para medir su comprensi√≥n del C√≥digo de Conducta.&nbsp;La no superaci√≥n de este cuestionario se le impide temporalmente de enviar esta rese√±a, tiempo durante el cual se recomienda que se familiarice con el C√≥digo de Conducta.</p>

<p><strong>Nota:</strong>&nbsp;En la actualidad, la prohibici√≥n de dispositivos de Xbox no son elegibles para la revisi√≥n de casos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

¬øC√≥mo env√≠o una revisi√≥n del caso?

<ol><li><strong>Inicia sesi√≥n</strong>&nbsp;para enforcement.xbox.com con la cuenta que recibe la acci√≥n de cumplimiento y seleccione la caja grande con un&nbsp;<strong>icono del martillo de naranja</strong>&nbsp;, o visite su&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Historia de Aplicaci√≥n</a>&nbsp;.</li><li>Encuentra la acci√≥n de cumplimiento que desea han revisado y seleccione&nbsp;<strong>solicitar la revisi√≥n</strong>&nbsp;.</li><li>Leer los T√©rminos de revisi√≥n de casos de uso y estoy de acuerdo marcando la casilla correspondiente y seleccionando&nbsp;<strong>acuerdo</strong>&nbsp;.</li><li>Si ya es elegible para una revisi√≥n del caso, seleccione el&nbsp;<strong>icono de la flecha verde</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Si usted a√∫n no es elegible, se le presentar√° con un breve cuestionario.&nbsp;Estas preguntas ayudan a medir su comprensi√≥n del C√≥digo de Conducta y las pol√≠ticas asociadas.&nbsp;Al completar con √©xito el cuestiona

<p>Despu√©s de la presentaci√≥n, una Pol√≠tica de Cumplimiento y agente de Xbox Live comenzar√° una revisi√≥n exhaustiva de la acci√≥n de cumplimiento.&nbsp;Esto incluye la revisi√≥n de los datos disponibles y de volver a examinar la evidencia que contribuy√≥ a la aplicaci√≥n, teniendo en cuenta los nuevos datos que ha proporcionado.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            In certain programs, the Surface Pen acts as finger touch instead of mouse click</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is regarding the Surface Pen belonging to the Surface Book 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In certain programs the pen acts as if I used my fingers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specific, if I want the equivalent of a single mouse click (left click, that is), I would either have to double tap or swipe the pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did not have this issue with Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I recently tried the Surface Book Pen on the same program (which was installed on the Surface Pro 3), and in this instance it acted as a mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've been trying to tweak the settings concerning the Surface Book pen within the settings, but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Quite a few things changed with pen behavior with the Fall Creators update. Can you tell me what build of windows both devices are running? To do this, run
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />on each Surface.
<br />
<br />Reply with OS/build number. 
<br />
<br />which apps in particular are acting differently?

            Who is the vendor? It is weird that it behaves differently on an SP3 vs SB running the same build. what happens if you pair the older pen with the SB? Same issue?

<p>Its called Desmume.&nbsp; Ive been searching their forums, but nothing specific concerning Surfaces has come up.&nbsp; I've been trying different versions as well.&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any settings concerning the pen that dictates whether a program should translate the pen inputs as touches or clicks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yeah, that's right!&nbsp; Sorry, Ive been juggling between work and sorting out problems with my new Surface.</p>
<p>My post disappeared last night (although I found it again today), but I found a earlier post in which you suggested rebooting while still plugged in.&nbsp; That solved it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will sort out my other post shortly!</p>

            There aren't any settings for single left click (but I've recommended to others that they use the Feedback Hub App to file this as a suggestion and think you should do the same). I can't visualize what you are trying to left click on. By default, if you tap a menu, it should open or if you tap a button, it should activate that button. It would be really tough in a game emulator (I would think) to use the pen to replace a mouse, depending on the game (and I'm NOT a gamer). 
<br />
<br />I really don't know where else to suggest you look for a solution - this is the first time anyone has asked about using a pen as a mouse inside a game emulator, but I'm thinking that you should post in the Desmume forums and start a conversation there on this.

<h2>            Confusion About  &#34;Intel&#34;, its Function and Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently installed the Clickfree Backup system.&nbsp; Operating System is Windows 7 64bit.&nbsp; Desktop PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since installing Clickfree, each time I start the computer I get the Intel icon in the middle of the screen which I must click on before I get the "Welcome" and Windows starts up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I cannot confirm if this happened after I installed Clickfree, however I am unable to open the Documents Folder with MS Photodraw.&nbsp; "Intel" seems to show up when I try to get to Documents.&nbsp; I can open My Pictures and My Music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for some advice on "Intel", its function and purpose, and how to get rid of it on the startup.&nbsp; Also is there any way to enable MS Photodraw to open My Documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All advice and commentary gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>SamB74</p>

            Intel makes the CPU and maybe the support chips as well. You need to describe ONE problem in detail. What does unable to open My Documents actually mean -what happened when you tried?

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry about the poorly worded problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can open documents in MS Photodraw by clicking "My Documents" on the left side of the dialog box, so that has been solved for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had taken some screen shots showing the Intel folder and ikon, just to demonstrate where it is, but am unable to finde where I can attach them here for you to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Intel is at the top of the list of folders when I click the Windows symbol at the bottom left.&nbsp; If I point at the Intel name an ikon of a light with the moon in the background shows up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When I open Windows Explorer there is an Intel Folder with all the data folders in it.&nbsp; Under Intel there is a folder "Documents" which has a couple of recordings I had made off an old LP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Under the "Libraries" folder when I click "Documents" (obviously not the same "Documents" as the one mentioned in the previous point), I get Intel and all its folders, including the "Documents" folder with recordings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When start the computer, I get a screen with that Intel ikon (light and moon)&nbsp;in the middle, which I must click before the computer will proceed to the "Welcome" screen and finish startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Clickfree which I have recently installed&nbsp;has named the computer "Intel" in its backup setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand the purpose of the Intel folder, and wonder if you know why it is there.&nbsp; It does not interfere with the use of the computer, so perhaps I should just leave it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to see the screen shots pls let me know how to get them to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>SamB74</p>
