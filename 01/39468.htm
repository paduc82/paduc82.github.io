<h2>            Network adapter not showing in network connections</h2>
                    Hi I have a problem connecting my PC to the internet via Ethernet cable. When I plug my cable into my router, the Ethernet adapter "{Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller" is present under network adapters in the device manager but doesn't show up in network
 connections. All help on how to fix this is appreciated.

<h2>            Please help&#63; ERROR 80027EFE, will not allow me to Windows Update&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Win Vista Home Premium Ver 6, Serv Pack 2 on a Dell XP 420 that is less than two years old.&nbsp; Since 06/03/2010 my computer will not update Windows Updates (and fwiw Dell PC TuneUp has stopped working as well, w/ the same error).&nbsp;System Restore
 says that the last Scheduled : System Checkpoint was made 06/02/2010 @ 12a.m. with a Windows Update to follow&nbsp;one on 06/02 @ 10:47p.m. and the other on 06/03 @ 6:00p.m. On the Update History log&nbsp;it shows that on 06/04 updates for 2007 MS Office System and
 2007 Security for MS Office System were successfully installed.&nbsp;I am not really that computer savy, but know enough to get myself around.&nbsp; I have Nortan Anti-Virus and Utilities on my pc as well as CCleaner and Malawarebytes, the two latter installed after
 this issue so&nbsp;I to check for sys/reg errors, it found a few, but they have been corrected. Could there have been issues with the Windows Update of 06/04 (*the last Checkpoint created 06/02) that have screwed up my pc and given me the new error that is stopping
 my ability for future Windows Updates? Also, all of my querying for the Windows Error 800027efe had been done at work w/ no issues. There I found several message boards discussing it and had access to all sites, but now @HOME and even directly from the Error
 Message (which says, "Get help with this error"), when googling the same sites brings me to a screen of site link options like any other google search, but when I click to read the links,will not allow me to access any of the MS sites or previous discussion
 forums for the error, but rather I am redirected to a bunch of junk fix product sites promising resolution to my error.&nbsp; How important is it that I recieve MS/Vista updates form this point further?&nbsp; Should I be as worried as I am?&nbsp; I have all of my docs/pics/tunes
 updated on to an external 500gig Toshiba hd nightly, so&nbsp;I will loose would be my OS/software (not that that is a good thing). Should I do a system update to the last good checkpoint prior to the most recent Windows Updates downloaded on 06/04? What suggestions&nbsp;are
 there to fix the 80027EFE error? Please help? Thanks. -Jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thank yor for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norton Antivirus&nbsp;expired yesterday 06/11, but I renewed 06/10 )kind of ironic that this started happening a week ago).&nbsp; Norton has been on this pc as part of my order w/ Dell (it came recommended) from the factory 05/2008.&nbsp;
 This probelm just started sometime between 06/03 &amp; 06/04. Honestly, I do not use this pc that much, maybe&nbsp; 3-4hrs a week, surf the web occasionally, but use primarily the MS Suite Office/Excel/PowerPoint)PPT) and&nbsp;the Windows Media Center.&nbsp; I do not download
 anything except the updates whether for MS/Vista apps or the virus updates (whatever those may be).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did recently download a viewer&nbsp;for PPT&nbsp;as I was trying to view a file that was created on an earlier version (old pc), did that because of a text converter
 error that I could not view, but it did not seem to work or I do not know how to use it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little use of this pc &nbsp;is why am sooo upset about th

            Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly.<br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop: 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall&nbsp;<strong>Norton AntiVirus</strong> (NAV),
<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any <strong>Norton Add-ons</strong> via <strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Do a clean install of&nbsp;NAV 2010&nbsp;using your Product ID &amp; reboot:<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE: Do not enable or install any Norton Add-ons (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.<br />

<p>Thank you again for your reply. I unfortunately have to run out for a bit, so I will not be able to attempt this operation until later. I am very nervous about this kind of thing, is there a way to reset should this not work?</p>
<p>For #1, Is not a problem, Should I disconnect from the 'net after downloading? Between steps 2-5? ...In the time it has taken for me to write this I have been notified by Norton&nbsp;8x that attacks were made to my pc and blocked.</p>
<p>For #2, I don't believe I have any open other than this IE? Can/Should I just check the Task Manager, and right click them off? or is there more to it than that?</p>
<p>For #3, will the product key for a renewal work the same as for the original software? I have the Product Key for</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>Norton Internet Security™ 2009 Subscription Renewal readily availbable, if other, it may take some time to find(I recently moved).<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>For #4, it was not on, but I turned it on just now, will it be up-to-date seeing as to it has not been updated in a week? Does it matter? NAV Smart Firewall is on as well, should I shut it off? Does it matter?</span></p>
<p>For #5, If you answer yes to disconnecting (in #1), reconnect to the 'net of #6?</p>
<span>
<p>For #7, ok</p>
<p>For #8a, will that delete my Favorites? Should I back them first? Anything else I should note or will lose? Will I lose the Malwarebytes, CCleaner and the Norton Utilities added on 06/10?</p>
<p>For #8b, is DEFAULT &amp; AGRESSIVE self explanatory once I go to the link? Anything else I should note or will lose? Will I lose the Malwarebytes, CCleaner and the Norton Utilities added on 06/10?</p>
<p>Being tied together, Windows Defender will not update either, same error code as Windows Update. My Dell PC Tune Up which monitored my pc was also giving me the error, unfortunately I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, now it cant find all of its components
 and I have a subscription til 2012 and Dell won't support it (go figure, problem for another day). These errors began prior to my Norton renewal, I first noticed it w/ the PC TuneUp not functioning but later realized it was for all Windows-related Updates.
 Have you ever seen the error 80027efe code before? If yes, was this successful in clearing it up?</p>
<p>I am not quite sure why there are different font sizes? I wrote this in WordPad all at the same size/font and copied it here. I had accidently clicked your links while writing earlier, and deleted&nbsp;this msg, so thought I would be safe this time and opted
 to write no&nbsp;directly in this thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. -Jeff</p>

<p>Don't overthink this, OK? Everything I posted is perfectly safe to do <em>if you do everything in order &amp; exactly as I've outlined.</em></p>
<p>The "Let me do it for myself" sections of KB923737 and KB971058&nbsp;both explain what the automated&nbsp;fixes will do &amp; the consequences of thereof.</p>
<p>If all of your problems started before you renewed your subscription (and the subscription had not, in fact,&nbsp;already expired when you renewed on the 10th), you may be seeing the effects of a hijackware infection. If such is the case, you may not be able
 to do&nbsp;the clean install of NAV 2010. Then again, if that's the case, NAV isn't working properly anyway now so you've really&nbsp;got nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Thanks again for you reply. I have yet to execute this operation due to work commitments, but hope to work on this week. One other idea, would another approach be to go into the System Configuration and reset the system to its last good System Checkpoint?
 Other than losing any docs/files edited since 06/03, a few attempts to clean the registry and my renewed NAV2010, nothing has been done to the pc. Would this system restore fix what ever could be giving the error? Is that essentially what your #3 response
 is saying, but w/ added IE reset and safeguards?</p>

<p>I have nothing further to add at this point except for the following.</p>
<p>If you ever think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimized (it doesn't), read<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>In other words, injudicious use of "Registry cleaners" may have caused your problem.</p>

<h2>            I keep getting Trojans in a so-called MS folder on my PC - Is it a genuine folder or can I delete it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Twice in 3 days, I have turned on my PC and AVG has secured a threat in the following folder (I have blanked out my user data):</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\Files\SO\52\</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first file it quarantined was&nbsp;Account_Verification_Form[179].pdf (Infected with PDF:UrlMal-inf [Trj]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second file it quarantined was Invoice_Receipt_283719389156273[181].pdf (infected with Other:Malware-gen [Trj]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first instinct is to delete the entire folder&nbsp;microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\Files\SO\52\</p>
<p>
</p><p>But of course, I'm wary of deleting anything containing supposed MS files. But I'm guessing it's not a genuine MS folder, as I can't see any reason why MS would send me viruses! :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just wanted to check with some people who know more about this stuff than I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete or not??</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />That's the Windows Mail appdata folder so shouldn't harm any System files if you delete it, but if so you can always reinstall Windows Mail which I'll show how.
<br />
<br />I'd also triple check with  Malwarebyes from <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a> and AdwcCleaner from <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a> which are the most powerful scanners out there right now and good tools to keep on hand.  
<br />
<br />Then I'd uninstall AVG which is not recommended by any expert in forums (where we see the most cases by the thousands) since it bloated up and started causing issues 10 years ago.  Use built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />After scans and cleaning, restart PC, then do a System File scan to repair any damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />You can reinstall the Windows 10 Mail app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Disturbing issue with XBox Wireless Controller and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joaor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disturbing issue with XBox Wireless Controller and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, guys.</p>
<p>So, I'm going through some really upsetting issue in my Windows 10. I'll explain it as much as I can:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this XBox Wireless Controller (One S edition - the one with built-in bluetooth that works on windows 10 without adapter) and an updated Windows 10 notebook from Dell (in case it matters, is this Inspiron 15 Gaming Edition - 7559).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently, I was playing games without any problems. The process, as always, was to simply turn on the XBox controller and wait for windows to connect with it. In worst case scenarios, a quick bluetooth reset or un-pairing the controller and re-pairing
 it did the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>But since yesterday I'm not being able to get the controller connected to the PC via Bluetooth - and, worst, the symptoms are getting weirder.</strong></span> So, I'll list them all here and hope really hard
 that one of you guys should be able to help me:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When I open my bluetooth settings, it shows that "Xbox Wireless Controller" is paired - but don't connect, no matter if the controller is turn on or off. [<strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JCkNhPk.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></strong>]
 (My PC is in portuguese, don't mind that)</li><li>When I remove the paired controller and try to pair it again, it just doesn't show on the list - all I get is some random "unknown devices" sometimes.&nbsp; [<strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pYPmIut.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></strong>]
 (to be clear: I put the controller in sync mode before doing this, holding the BT button for a while)</li><li>When I turn my bluetooth off and on again after&nbsp;un-pairing the controller, it ALWAYS, no matter what, seems to reinstall and configure the device all over again. Picture this: You unpair the controller and perform a full power off/on to the computer. As
 soon as windows boots, the message "We're configuring 'XBox Wireless Controller'" appears [<strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mZss5be.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></strong>], and soon after it reads "'XBox Wireless Controller' is ready
 for use" [<strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Wn2AIz5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></strong>]. This message pops up no matter if I tried to pair it, if it's on in sync mode, if it's off, etc. It always reinstalls this specific device. ALWAYS.
<ul>
<li>I tried unpairing my bluetooth phones and doing the same process and nothing unusual happens. Then, I pair my phones normally without issues.</li></ul>
</li><li>When I run my bluetooth troubleshoot, no issues are detected and my other BT accessories pair and connect normally.</li><li>When I try to pair my Xbox Controller with my girlfriend's notebook, IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY as it should, so I believe the problem is not in my controller.</li><li>I have tried to update each and every driver, from the bluetooth/wifi board to the wired controller update via XBox Accessories windows 10 app. All uptated, no drive errors, and still the problem persists.</li><li>If I connect the controller through an USB cable it works (just while wired) and is shown simply as "Controller", under "Other devices". [<strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/sev1qhm.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></strong>]</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TL;DR</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>So, in conclusion</strong>, I'm probably missing something but I don't remember updating my PC or anything else in the last few days, and since yesterday I'm not being able connect my XBox Controller via bluetooth. However, other bluetooth devices
 connect normally to my PC and my controller connects normally via bluetooth to other PCs. Also, every time I reset my bluetooth, it seems to reinstall and reconfigure the controller (even when the controller is turned off). I already did check the drivers,
 the troubleshoots and the most popular help pages - without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of you guys know something that might be useful to me? Any insights?</p>
<p>As a last resource, if nothing works I should restore my windows (wich would be tiresome due to gigantic reinstalls and reconfigurations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and have a great day! :)</p>

            Hi Joao.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See troubleshooting here for wireless bluetooth Xbox Controller problems:
<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-and-troubleshoot-xbox-one-bluetooth-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/...</a>

<br />
<br />I'll give all other possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br /> See Fixes here which are all working:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-windows-10-recognize-bluetooth-dongle-as-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-wi...</a>
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />If this is a mic or headset right click Volume icon in System Tray to Open Sound Settings,  make sure the correct device is selected for input or output in the dropdown menu.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi, Greg.</p>
<p>So, I went through several of your links and tips and nothing worked.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm getting pretty upset over here and what is driving me nuts and I believe is the cause of it all is the following:</p>
<p><strong>Every single time I remove the XBox Wireless Controller from my bluetooth devices, my windows automatically reinstalls it as soon as it gets the chance, even if I never tried to pair it again, even if the controller is on or off, even if I'm pairing
 a whole different BT device (I tried re-pairing my phones and windows did it right, but also started to configure the controller).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the device (it always comes back).</p>
<p>I tried deleting the BT card itself and reboot windows so it reinstalls, and <strong>
the moment it reinstall, it also reinstalls de xbox controller as well.</strong></p>
<p>I tried rolling back my drivers and, no matter driver version, the moment BT becomes online, it starts configuring the controller.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Again: All of this just ignores the controller itself. It might be turned on in my hands or turned off in other city.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what more to do that isn't a full system restore.</p>
<p>Any additional light on the subject?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />
</p>
<p><br />

Next is a BlackScreen with the Options_&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>When i select F9 / BootDeviceOptions, then i see that there are 2 different OS-Startup options.&nbsp;I guess first is pre-selected and causes the Error Message.<br />
The seccond Option "OS boot Manager" -works, i can boot normal into Windows 10.<br />

</p><p>But the next Statup is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---&gt; How can i edit this StartupOption from BootManager?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to delete the false preselected "OS Boot Manager" (1st Option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did also allready look in BIOS, but there are no such Options, i can select different Devices, but there is only 1 "OS Startup" -Option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>---&gt; Where do i find the Boot Manager running Windows 10? With which Program can i edit the Options?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hello Manuel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't boot your PC and it shows that error, it can can possibly be repaired by using
<strong>System Diagnostics</strong>. To get there, boot your PC and continuously press ECS, until you reach the
<strong>Startup menu</strong>. You can refer to your first and second screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>From <strong>Startup menu</strong>, press <strong>F2</strong> (or whatever the designated key is)
<strong>for System Diagnostics.</strong></li><li>Use arrow keys to navigate and choose <strong>Hard Drive Check</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Extensive Check.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Let it finish and it will fix the corrupted files automatically. </p>

<p>
</p><p>One that you're able to boot successfully, now we can Funnel down the issue; let's check
<strong>msconfig</strong> if the suspected Failed-OS can be deleted from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Start search section</strong>, type-in <strong>msconfig</strong>, hit
<strong>Enter</strong> then go to <strong>Boot</strong> tab. From there you'll immediately see the available OS's that you have. Select/Highlight the failed OS (the one that is not labeled as "Current OS"), and click on
<strong>"Delete"</strong> button. Once done, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>
restart the PC</strong> (Important). </p>

<p><strong><em>In this image, the delete button will show grayed-out; I only have 1 OS in my hard drive.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have it there, that must be in your BIOS. On your second screenshot, you have the option to press F10, that will lead you to the BIOS setup. From there, we're not certain about the interface, but that should have at least a Tab for Boot, boot
 manager, or Advanced boot settings/options. From there, you can look for a possible option to disable the Failed-OS from being one of the boot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version of BIOS do you have? To check it, go to <strong>CMD (Command prompt)</strong> and enter this command (you can use copy paste):

<h2>            Windows 7 problems with nVidia nForce3 Ultra SATA</h2>
                    When I was installing Windows 7 on my GA-K8NS Ultra-939 motherboard, the setup was not detecting non of the SATA disk drives.<br />
I have ended-up installing Windows 7 on ATA disk.<br />
After booting in Windows 7, the Device Manager shows problem with Mass Storage Controller, but has seem to have all SATA drivers properly installed.<br />
However it does not see any of the SATA drives connected to the nVIDIA nForce3 controller. The other SATA controller on the board (Sil3512) works ok.<br />
Rebooting Windows XP shows no problems with nVIDIA nForce3 SATA.<br />
I have downloaded and re-installed drivers from http://www.gigabyte.us/Support/Motherboard/Driver_Model.aspx?ProductID=1881 but that did not help. I reverted back to Microsoft version of nVidia parallel and serial ATA - they are newere then GIGABYTEs. Same
 problem persist on Windows 7.<br />

            If Device Manager is seeing the controller, the diskmgmt.msc should be able to help you with the SATA drives attached to it. Rightclick any of those drive letters for info. I would also look for a report in the Control Panel/Action Center.&nbsp;

            Hi fourcand,<br />
<br />
By default any program you install goes to the C drive unless you change it to a different location. In your case it seems to be on C drive.<br />
<br />
How many partitions do you have on your External hard drive?<br />
<br />
On your external HArd Drive, itune image backup would be stored in the first partition of the external hard drive unless you changed it to a different preferred location. It is usually listed as "E" or whatever letter you have given to the first partitioned
 drive . Search in that drive.<br />
<br />

    <title>Laptop Stopped Working After Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop Stopped Working After Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>My Laptop &nbsp;which worked flawlessly with Windows 7 Home Premier edition has not functioned in any useful way since the Upgrade to Windows 10. The Laptop will show the startup window, allow me to login and then a Blue screen with a flash of icons (only once
 after login) and then nothing. I can do a crt/alt/delete. From there I can use the task manager, but there are no apps running and other than shutting down and changing the Wireless network, I can do nothing with this Laptop. I need help to either reinstall
 Windows 10 or revert back to Windows 7 Premium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - I am writing this from my Desktop that did successfully upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 so I know it can work....it's just frustrating to see my laptop rendered useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Laptop is a HP Pavilion dm4 - As mentioned previously this machine performed flawlessly and now is useless. I can't seem to find a way to get MS help so any advise would be helpful at this point.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to do a startup repair using the Windows 10 installation media and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is the link to create Windows 10 ISO:<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use installation or recovery media to get to startup settings: <br />
1.&nbsp;Insert the USB drive or DVD and restart your PC. If you’re using recovery media, skip the next step.<br />
2.&nbsp;On the Install Windows page, select Repair your computer. (If you’re not seeing this page, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check out info from your PC manufacturer on how to change boot order and then try again.)<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Repair. Follow the onscreen instructions and if you can boot the computer to desktop.<br />
For more information on recovery options in Windows 10, refer to the link.<br />

 and my computer altogether just froze. I had to force shut it down by holding the power button and when I restarted it there were a ton of graphical issues on the monitor and the resolution was at 640x480 and I can't change it. &nbsp;Any help with this?</p>

<p>Hi dummydon,</p>
<p>When troubleshooting system-wide issues with iTunes, there are a few different suggestions to try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <strong>Check for viruses</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows viruses can interfere with a variety of computer functions including iTunes. Make sure that you have current anti-virus software installed with updated virus definitions and use it to scan your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <strong>Check for anti-virus and/or Internet security software</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Security software itself can sometimes cause iTunes to quit unexpectedly. Try disabling the Internet Security software temporarily or exempting iTunes from any active scanning done by such software. If this resolves the issue, check with the
 maker of the software for an update to the software or its virus definitions.</p>
<p>First I suggest you to uninstall the iTunes by following the steps given in this link and then re-install the latest version of iTunes.</p>
<p><strong>Removing and reinstalling iTunes, QuickTime, and other software components for Windows Vista or Windows 7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923</strong></a><br />

<p>Hi ClareS12,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question! This may be caused by an incorrect keyboard layout configuration.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select <strong>Start</strong>, choose <strong>Settings</strong>, select <strong>
Time &amp; Language</strong> and then choose <strong>Region and Language</strong> on the left. Confirm that the correct language pack is installed. For example,
<strong>English (United States) </strong>is the default selection for devices sold in the US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If the language is not correct:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Add a language</strong></li><li>Select the preferred language from the list</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If the language is correct: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the language</li><li>Choose <strong>Options</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Add a keyboard</strong></li><li>Select the preferred keyboard layout from the list</li><li>Remove any unwanted keyboard layouts</li></ol>

<h2>            My VPN crashes constantly, task manager shows CPU red-lining when it happens</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am required to use my company's VPN in order to work. &nbsp;My VPN will crash constantly, sometimes many times in a short period, then it will go for a while without crashing. &nbsp;I have been leaving the Task Manager open, and when I hear the tone from my computer
 telling me the VPN has crashed and is attempting to reconnect, the Task Manager CPU usage is red-lining up to 100%. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed all extraneous anti-virus programs and their components, and have run all scans including Microsoft Safety Scanner. &nbsp;I use only Windows Defender, but even turning it off behind the VPN firewall does not help this situation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all the processes, and there is nothing I can see that is not necessary. &nbsp;The problem seems worse after my employer forced me to upgrade my internet service from DSL to cable. &nbsp;I have spoken to my ISP (Time Warner) extensively, and made many
 alterations to the router settings (**** DG860), and they wished me to setup a Virtual Server port 500. &nbsp;My employer's IT department does not recognize this setup, and cannot provide the information it would require. &nbsp;I really don't think that the router
 is the problem, however. &nbsp; I think the problem is Windows 8, since the CPU usage seems to be causing the crashes from some internal process, which is difficult to identify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! &nbsp;<br />

            <p>There's a few, one from Microsoft called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> comes to mind, which I think will let you log over a time frame so you can review it without missing it as it flies past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be something mundane, the spike in CPU may be the crash handler logging the fault as the program crashes. Or it might be the program itself getting into&nbsp;a race condition where it itself is the cause of the CPU usage.&nbsp; That'd make sense, since the
 program is locked in the race condition and can't respond to your input, so you have to force the program to end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: is this VPN program working well on other Windows 8 machines that you know of?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same issue and just got off the phone with Microsoft - The svchost.reg file didn't fix my issue. However, this fixed my issue maybe it'll fix yours.</p>
<p>Set Cryptsvc as DependOnService on HTTP driver.</p>
<p>HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Serivces\HTTP and create following value.</p>
<p>Name: DependOnService Value: reg_multi_sz (this is a multi string)</p>
<p>Click DependOnService Set CryptSvc on the value.</p>
<p>Reboot the server</p>

<h2>            possible microsoft telephone scam</h2>
                    <p>hello - I have been receiving daily telephone calls from 'No Caller ID' from people claiming to work for Microsoft in relation to hacking of my account. All of the callers have had an Indian accent and some have hung up when I've asked for a number to call
 back on until today.</p>
<p>An Indian lady gave me her details and asked me to call her back on:</p>
<p>Microsoft, Thames Valley Park, Reading</p>
<p>Employee ID 1721</p>
<p>Amanda Parker</p>
<p>0118 328 2346</p>
<p>still sounds dodgy and I will not be calling her back, as 'Amanda Parker' does not sound of Indian decent?
</p>
<p>is this normal procedure for Microsoft to be calling me via phone without previous initiation from myself?</p>
<p>I recently lost a laptop so am curious it could be something to do with this? </p>
<p>please help?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>paul.</p>

<h2>            Dialog &#47; Popup boxes not displaying content fully&#63;</h2>
                    I have a problem with pop up dialog boxes on Windows 10 not displaying the content fully. Its rather frustrating as I can not see most of the text or the buttons to click on. I have changed my resolutions to different ones and also display size but the
 problem still persists. It only seems to do this with pop up dialog boxes, such as software installation boxes. My display is a 48" Samsung 4K TV rung HDMI from a Nvidia GTX 980Ti GPU. Does anyone have a fix for this?

            Guru, thanks for your reply. Sadly this did not work. Yes it changed the size of the font in the message box but it still did not display fully in the box.

 resolutions on this TV&nbsp;but the problem is still there. The TV that it DID work on straight away way my 26" Samsung TV.

<p>again thanks for your replies. OK, I have tried this and I have the latest download for my graphics card. See below 2 pictures of a message box that I have taken. the first picture is how the box SHOULD look like. The second picture is what it looks like
 on my 48" TV. I have tried to maximise the box and it just stays the same apart from re-locating to the bottom right of my TV! I have also tried to enlarge the box but it wont allow me to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it should look like:</p>

    <title>Synaptics Touchpad V7.5 driver failure after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evanstubbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad V7.5 driver failure after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. Upon completing the update, I now have issues with my Synaptics Touchpad mouse driver (V7.5). Before the update, I did not have any issues with the mouse driver but now it is not recognized after each
 time I power cycle my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mouse still recognizes movement/clicking, however, the additional functions, such as two finger scrolling, become disabled after a power cycle. When I go into the mouse settings, it says "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Unable to
 connect to the Synaptics Pointing Device Driver.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you have installed another PS/2 Pointing Device Driver please uninstall the Synaptics driver by clicking on the Yes button. You then need to reinstall
 your pointing device driver for your external device again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you want to uninstall the Synaptics driver now?"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, power cycling computer, completely removing drivers and downloading the latest versions, but none of these have given me an actual solution to this. If I'm lucky, sometimes the driver
 will eventually start working and I'll have the extra functionality of the mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is this a common issue exclusively with Windows 8.1? Is there any known remedy to resolve this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Siging in using True Key Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Siging in using True Key Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 10's Picture Password for more than a year now.&nbsp; Sometime in the 3rd week of December of 2018 this option is no longer showing, and cannot log into Windows and all of my files.&nbsp; I am not sure if this somehow related to to True Key,
 but the True Key option is showing now, even if I have not set it up.&nbsp; I have created a Microsoft account, but have not sync / configured this as my log-in account in Windows, as I assumed that the picture password is reliable.&nbsp; I have seen related topics
 that have resolution using Microsoft Account's log-in details, but this is not applicable to me.&nbsp; I have not also created a USB for password reset (which I understand can only be set-up once one is already in Windows),&nbsp; so this option is also not applicable
 to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please HELP.&nbsp; I do not want to reset my laptop, as I have numerous important files in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi Francis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how difficult it could be. We will look into this for you. This issue may be due to True Key being enabled on your system and True Key is by McAfee which eliminates the hassle of remembering passwords.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow steps mentioned below to uninstall True Key standalone program and check if it resolves your issue.</span></p>

<p>Thanks, Manjunath H</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to do the steps you recommended, as I can't enter windows to begin with.&nbsp; Picture password option was missing, and that was part of my problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now able to enter Windows by using a USB Bootable USB, and reset by PC to the latest update.&nbsp; It worked...the picture password option showed, and I was able to enter Windows.&nbsp; I noticed though that TrueKey was there even prior to the latest update,
 so now I'm not sure if that is indeed the cause of the problem (Picture Password option is missing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other problem still remains though.&nbsp; I have a local windows password which I have forgotten, and so I cannot change or update it, even if I want to.&nbsp; I can enter Windows now using Picture Password, but I am now receiving a notification from windows for
 Updates Available, which I'm scared that part may have screwed up my picture password option (not showing), and might do the same now when I install the recommended Windows Updates.&nbsp; I'm delaying the updates until I can reset my local password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp; How can I update my password, if I have forgotten the current password?&nbsp; It is required for updating, even for setting / updating &nbsp; I want to set things right now by recording my password in a safe place, possibly using a USB reset password
 tool, linking into a Microsoft Account, creating a Hint, and other recommended actions I have seen online to prevent the previous mishap happening again.&nbsp; I can only do these If I can reset my alph / numeric password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, in advance.</p>
<p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Al_Swearengen,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Do you have Visual Studio or Visual C++ installed on your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If you have Visual studio or any other such application you may check if you have the latest updates installed for
 the application.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may check if re-registering the msvcrt.dll file assists you resolve the issue -</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click on Start and then click on Run.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Now you can type the below command (without quotes)&nbsp;-<br />
“Regsvr32 C:\Windows\System32\msvcrt.dll”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Once the command is input into the Run field correctly, press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Once the DLL has been registered, you should receive a confirmation in the form of a pop up box. This message will list your newly registered
 DLL file and confirm that is was successfully registered into the registry. </span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover the files if needed –<strong>Follow the
 below steps to</strong> <strong>p</strong></span><strong><span>erform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>,
 click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I understand the issue, you are unable to upgrade Windows XP to Windows 8 and receive error message 'This Platform Is Not Supported'. Please let me know if this is not correct.</div>
<div><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong></div>
<div>1. How are you trying to upgrade Windows XP to Windows 8?</div>
<div>2. To which edition of Windows 8 you are trying to upgrade?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.&nbsp; Are you trying to install 32bit or 64bit Windows 8?</div>
<div>Let's first check if your computer meets minimum System Requirements for Windows 8 or not.</div>
<div>I would suggest you to run <strong>Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant</strong> to check if your computer is ready to install Windows 8 or not.</div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you are currently running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can only perform an upgrade to another 32-bit version of Windows. Similarly, if you are running a 64-bit version of Windows, you can only perform an upgrade to another 64-bit
 version of Windows. </p>
<div><strong>Also&nbsp;refer Upgrading section from this link for additional information:
</strong></div>

Hope this information helps. Reply with the required information to help you to fix the issue.</p>

            Hello Geethu B,<br />
<br />
I am also having the same problem as foolman123. Hopefully I'm not cutting in where I shouldn't be but I thought I'd ride this thread with the hopes of getting some answers.<br />
<br />
I'll answer your questions in the order that they appeared.<br />
<br />
1. I'm trying to see if it is possible to upgrade through Microsoft's website as a digital download. The error that foolman123 mentioned is the same I am getting when I run the "Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant."<br />
<br />
2. I'm currently running Windows XP Pro 64bit and would like to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro 64bit.<br />
<br />
3. The error "This platform is not supported" only appears in the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant.<br />
<br />
My PC currently exceeds the listed System Requirements for Windows 8.<br />
<br />
Seeing as the Assistant is giving me this error I have not attempted to buy or download Windows 8 to see if that would also give me the same error.<br />

It is because there is no upgrade path for XP to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
You need to do a clean install of Windows 8. The above links are for purchasing full versions of Windows 8 Pro (OEM) provided by

<div>Hey,</div>
<div>What i did in the end was create a iso image and boot it and do a clean install and the key worked still. I also rang microsoft and they said Microsoft should be releasing a iso for everyone to download today or tomorrow.</div>
<div>I created the iso from another computer. I went all the way after entering your product key and the download, after that it requests if you want to do a bootable cd and make that into a iso.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That was everything mate</div>

            Thank you for the prompt replies, fellas!<br />
<br />
Right now the biggest barrier for me is the price (and the possible work involved in figuring out what, if anything, will transfer). I'd prefer to not have to buy the full price, full version at triple the price of the upgrade if I can get away with it. I may
 attempt foolman123's suggestion after Microsoft releases their iso.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

            but on their web you can see this'
<p>Yes, but you can't do this using Upgrade Assistant. If your PC has a 64-bit capable processor (CPU) but is currently running a 32-bit version of
<span>Windows</span>, you can install a 64-bit version of <span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, but you'll need to buy
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> as a DVD.' I bough the dvd but I can not install that.</p>

            Are you saying that the platform referred to in the error message is Windows XP, and not a hardware platform?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'm using XP Professional SP3, and I also got the "platform not supported" message when I tried to run the Upgrade Assistant on my computer. I read about the processor requirements (PAE, NX, SSE2) on a couple of threads in this forum. I checked it out,
 and my CPU has those things enabled. So, at this point, the only explanation for the error message that makes sense is the fact that XP can't actually be upgraded to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8- just replaced by it.</div>

<h2>            Redeeming Xbox Gift Cards from Different Regions</h2>
                    Hi. I live in Australia and I have a friend from the US who wants to send me a $5 USD Gift card. I was wondering if it is still possible to redeem it and if it will be automatically turned into AUD or if that's not possible. Thank you :)

            Gift cards are region locked and so is not possible to redeem them in a different region. Your friend will need to send you a gift card in your currency.

            Unfortunately, your friend would need to send you the gift outside of the Xbox gifting feature. Gifts are region locked and you would not be able to redeem the passcode.

            This is not possible as Xbox doesn't "convert" currency across regions. However, if he wanted to say gift you a game or DLC or something purchased in the Xbox store, that should be possible.

            Probably easier to paypal you $5 and use it to buy a local card. Alternatively they could gift you something.&nbsp;

<p>No, gift cards need to be done in region.&nbsp; You could move your location region to the US and use the giftcard then. but you can not cross region use gift cards.</p>
