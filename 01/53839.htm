<h2>            Halo Had Lost It&#39;s Way Without Master Chief According To Microsoft.</h2>
                    

<p>When Halo 3: ODST and then Halo Reach came out without starting Master Chief after Halo 3 (Halo Wars does not count) the fans were asking a few questions about him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now after an interview OXM UK, Spencer said the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The key question for me in managing the studio and the creatives is 'what is Halo?,' making sure Halo lives up to what I think gamers fell in love with [playing Combat Evolved]... What does that mean? Playing Master Chief. We kind
 of lost our way a little bit, I’ll say. And that’s why I wanted to make sure that at the unveiling of Halo 4, you knew you were playing Master Chief, that John was back. Because Master Chief is the John Wayne character of that universe, and that’s who you
 want to play."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now since the company is refocusing the Halo Series for the fans, do you think that Halo CE Anniversary Edition and Halo 4 will live up the hype as well as Master Chief starting again on both games? Is playing as Master Chief even
 necessary for the franchise to thrive?</p>

<p>Reach was my favorite. It actually had more emotion than the emotionless super soldier. ODST while short had a really interesting story.</p>

<p>I think what i hated the most about reach where the Loadouts in MP they should have never put them in from the start . The Singleplayer for all halo games were always pretty average imo, except for CE.</p>

<p>Halo 3 ODST and Reach lost Halo's way because Bungie made it! Halo Wars didn't have Master Chief, but since M$ studio's made it. It didn't. Halo Wars rocked and is more Halo than Reach/ODST, even though it's an RTS!</p>

<p>It was cool seeing Master Chief return in Halo2 but that should've been the end of it. There's only so many times he can be super man before it becomes really boring and predictable. Now MS is gonna milk it for the fanboys and further alienate the rest of
 us. Have fun with that I'm probably done with the series unless it does something that's impossible to resist, which is pretty doubtful.</p>

<p>Judging by some of the comments here I must be the only person who actually likes Halo: Reach. Only thin I dislike is Armour Lock spam, but other than that I don't really have any issue against the game. It offers everything I look for in a game so is good
 value for money which just can't be said for alot of games nowadays.</p>

<p>For me ODST was the best, followed by Reach</p>
<p>MC is the real pansy, He relies on all these supersoldier upgrades to get the job done. The ODST guys are the real deal. They are normal Humans with Spec Forces training.</p>
<p>And the Noble team, well they are in the middle, because, with the exception of Jorge, they are all cheap copies of the original Spartans. &nbsp;Yet they do the job as good as if not better than MC. Seems to me MC isn't pulling his weight if he has all the upgrades
 and these Normal Humans and Knock off Spartans can do the job just as well.</p>
<p>I still enjoy ODST and am trying to convince a friend of mine who is on the fence to get it. He's not a Halo fan because he doesn't like the idea of MC being a super soldier, but he likes the idea of ODST because they are normal humans with superiro training.</p>
<p>Halo didn't lose it's way with ODST or Reach, because while these stories don't feature MC, they do take place in the Halo Universe and add to it with new stories and points of view we would not get just playing as MC. I think they Compliment the Halo Universe
 quite well.</p>

<p>Hey Cobra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite a few retailers carry the Ultimate Edition. Since it is such a popular game, you might have a hard time finding it at your local game/electronics shops. Last time I checked,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forza-Horizon-4-Ultimate-Xbox-One/dp/B07DJXXFCP?th=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Amazon</a> had it. Good luck on your hunt! This is one of those few games were the steelbook is worth it.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't know if you're still having problems, but according to Acer's website, Windows 10 is not compatible with some of their laptops, and the V3-551-8469 is on that list. &nbsp;I have the same model, and I can't even install Windows 10 at all on mine.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I actually replied to this thread because I was having the same issue however it was on my desktop. I resolved my issue with a windows re-install. was the only way I found to resolve it.</p>

<h2>            Ace Combat 6 won&#39;t download from disc.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, I have recently bought AC7 and have used the code for the digital download of AC6, however I still have the 360 disc and would like to use that to download the game as I have satellite internet.&nbsp; Every other game has downloaded off
 the disc when used except for AC6.&nbsp; This is especially important since, as previously stated I have poor internet - it's literally been stuck on 16kb of 5.7 GB for ten minutes now...&nbsp; Is there a way to get it to download from the disc or should I just stop
 buying Microsoft products altogether(the online 24/7 and digital downloading of everything requirements makes the xbox not much more than a frustration inducing paper weight which I, at this point, flat out regret buying)? &nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The xbox service alert going down has NOT fixed the problem.<br />

    <title>Trying to return my controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessyvdrn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to return my controller</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to contact Microsoft support for the past 4 days. Its either problems with the site, offices closed or as today.. authentication problems or some sort. My right stick is slowly drifting upwards and it is making it very hard to play any video
 game without staring at the sky. I would highly appreciate some extra help as my controller is 4 months old and it is not giving me the return option in my purchase history.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any e-mail address i can contact about this issue as it has been impossible to reach out to any support team so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Jessy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question on returning a controller. Typically there is a 90 day warranty on accessories like controllers. The only two ways to do a repair are either on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a> or requesting a call from support.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>When you go to
</span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Contact
 Us,</span></span></a><span><span>follow these steps to request a call from support:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 2 ----select see other options then subscription changes</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 3-----select show contact options</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>Step
 4 ----select request call from support</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to
 help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It didn't show any error codes and I did install it through the Windows Store. After that it said the apps ere installed. Also, while installing it asked me to uninstall WindowsBlinds and that's what I want back.</p>

<h2>            New Dell Latitude 3540 with Windows 7 Professional which shuts down without warning.</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 7 shuts down without warning I have to reboot even though the system protection is checked for automatic restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reboot I get the black screen asking if I want to start in safe mode because Windows didn't shut down correctly. &nbsp;I usually start it in normal mode and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on average about once every three to four weeks and can be at any time ie I could be in Outlook, Word or surfing the net etc. &nbsp;I don not do any gaming.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various reasons which can lead to random shut down of the computer. Heating,hardware issues and outdated version of BIOS are some of the major culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to check if the computer is getting overheated while it turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for the hardware issues, I would recommend that you run Dell&nbsp;Hardware Diagnostic Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on Dell&nbsp;Hardware Diagnostic Tool, please refer the link provided below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Outdated BIOS can also cause computer to shut down randomly, based on the version of Windows installed on the computer, please download and install the latest BIOS firmware from the link provided below.</p>

Dear Gerry, <br />
My computer is not branded, and its a Gigabyte motherboard. I have a Windows 7 Ultimate with Service Pack 1 installed 32 Bit. I too disabled Ccleaner from removing the temporary files.&nbsp; I typed the "system information" you told and here you can see the file:

The name of the file is "Desktop". Thanks.<br />

            <p>Update the BIOS to version F9 dated 21 June 2010</p>
<p>http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#bios</p>
<p>Use the Windows based BIOS live update utility:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>http://www.gigabyte.com/webpage/20/HowToReflashBIOS.html</p>
<p>Download and read carefully the PDF User Guide before attempting to update and follow the instructions carefully as updating the BIOS is not without risk.</p>
<p>On the Gigabyte web site is a link to Driver Agent:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#driver</a></p>
<p>http://www.driveragent.com/gigabytepromo.php</p>
<p>If you download and run the Driver Agent software it highlights out of date drivers. It is important at this point to appreciate that this service is provided with the intention
 of persuading you to pay for third party drivers they claim you need. However, you should take advantage of this service as it helps you get a picture of what is out of date or might be out of date. You do not have to pay for a report. Payment is only required
 for the second category of drivers described below. Study the notes carefully. You can distinguish in the report produced which drivers are current and which are out of date. Out of date drivers break down into two categories:</p>
<p>1. Free files –if you click on these they are easily updated. It works.</p>
<p>2. Files they want you to pay for. I suggest you make a list of these and post the details here. What it says about AMD drivers could be helpful.</p>
<p>My computer has a Gigabyte motherboard and I have used this service in the way described.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can manually update drivers here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#driver</a></p>
<p>Driver Agent does not offer Gigabyte Utility updates. I sugesst you update Easy Tune6 to version B11.0823.1 dated 23 August 2011. Please remove current/ earlier version of
 EasyTune6 and GWUM Tools before installing this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3261#utility</a></p>

            Thanks a lot Gerry but I don't want tp update the BIOS. I've updated&nbsp; all drivers and are u sure its a BIOS problem? Because my BIOS is running smoothly and since I dont have any problems i dont feel like flashing it. I aint an engineer u know, im 14!
 I dont know all this stuff. And also if i update bios i dont know how to set up again its just sooo risky!! :(<br />

    <title>Win10 unusable due to lags on both mouse and keyboard &#40;USB&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> batga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 unusable due to lags on both mouse and keyboard &#40;USB&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I know I'm hardly the first to report these kind of issues, which makes searching for answers a nightmare. (I've wasted two solid days already.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; Dell Precision M3800 laptop, windows7 pro, DELL Keyboard (USB) , Logitech M705 Mouse (WiFi/USB) ==&gt; All fine and happy</p>
<p>-&gt; Dell Precision 7530 laptop, <strong>windows10 pro</strong>, same Keyboard, same mouse ==&gt; regularly
<strong>impossible to use</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Issues I'm seeing: </p>
<p>- The mouse "freezes/lags" every few seconds for 0.3 - 5 sec before continuing to move</p>
<p>- The keyboard lags in similar frequency, sometimes loosing keystrokes and sometimes - on recovery - sending the last pressed letter 20+ times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried without success:</p>
<p>- Using different USB ports. (USB 3) for both mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>- Using a different mouse (generic no-name)</p>
<p>- Smashing my fist into the screen. (No, not really. But I want to.)</p>
<p>- Ensuring all drivers are update. Both via device manager, Windows Update, Dell Update</p>
<p>- Following various online instructions on disabling/removing things</p>
<p>- Screaming, cursing and crying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this "new laptop" has cost me two full working days already, my employer is
<em>really, really</em> unhappy with me and my productivity due to this issue is &lt;10% normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much like some advise on how to systematically investigate what software or hardware issue is causing this.</p>
<p>In particular the "lost keystrokes" and "repeated keystrokes" must be something that is hopefully log-able somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I found the solution. See my own long post below. </p>
<p>EDIT2: But I might have spoken too soon.... At least I have a culprit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>[TL;DR] --&gt; The <span><em>Dell USB3.0 dock D3100</em> <del>did not have the proper drivers &amp; software installed.</del></span></p>
<p><span>is causing the issue, whenever the Ethernet cable is also connected.</span></p>

            Hi BatGa 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi,BatGa
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running.
<br />1.	Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC.
<br />2.	In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />1.	Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages:
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually.
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems.
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

            Thanks for the suggestion, but I doubt it's that. This system is virtually "brand new" - win10 was installed from scratch last week. In any case, I've performed the sfc scan suggested by

<p>Hi, and thanks for the suggestions. </p>
<p>Regarding the DELL updates: The BIOS update was provided by the <strong>DELL Command | Update</strong> software - I did perform those updates yesterday but it didn't make a difference. i.e. the problem was there before, but also afterwards it persisted.</p>
<p>I will try the chip-set driver update as well. As I prefer links to the webpage instead of files directly (for security reasons), I used that one:
<a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=691vf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=691vf">
ChipSet driver (DELL webpage)</a>&nbsp; - but it is the same you've mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report if this fixes the issues (I'm not all too hopeful, though.)</p>
<p>

            Microsoft is starting to roll out the next version of Windows 10, version 1903. You can try upgrading to that release over the next few weeks and see if it offers any improvement.

<p><strong>I think I finally found the culprit of the problem and a solution. (Finger crossed. But at least the last 60min seemed without that issue.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm typing this here so follow-readers with the same or similar problem might benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> When I migrated from my "old" Dell Precision M3800 laptop to my "new" Dell Precision 7530 laptop, I was so taken by the simply plug&amp;play setup of win10 that I just
<em>assumed</em> my docking station (or rather USB 3.0 dock) would work as well. And why not?</p>
<p>If i just put in the USB 3 port, all seemed to work: I could run multiple monitors, have my LAN go through the port as well as my mouse and keyboard - exactly as with my old M3800.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I WAS WRONG.</strong></em></p>
<p>It turns out, that DELL even has a little page on the issue, which I luckily discovered today:
<a href="http://dell.to/2l3vK5S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dell.to/2l3vK5S</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: I had to make sure that the following steps are followed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the<span> <em>Dell USB3.0 dock D3100</em> is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> connected to the laptop</span></p>
<p><span>- all according drivers and software are uninstalled ( - I hadn't any installed - )</span></p>
<p><span>- all other DELL drivers are up-to-date (which they were for me), in particular:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span><span>system BIOS </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - USB 3 drivers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - chipset drivers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span><span>video drivers</span></p>
<p><span>- Windows itself was full up-to-date (which it was for me)</span></p>
<p><span>Then (still not connected) I downloaded and installed the drivers for the&nbsp;
</span><span><em>Dell USB3.0 dock D3100</em>.</span></p>
<p>And only afterwards I connected the D3100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And wonder over wonder (or just tech?) - everything worked fine. I have my mouse/keyboard connected via the DisplayLink dock (<span><em>Dell USB3.0 dock D3100</em>), and now nothing stutters or freezes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Important lesson learnt:</strong></p>
<p>I might have found that issue earlier, if it wouldn't have been for the misleading fact that - as long as the DisplayLink was connected -
<em>it didn't make a difference whether or not the keyboard&amp;mouse where connected directly to the laptop (on a free USB 3) or via the dock</em>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words: Having that dock connected <em>always</em> produced the stutter also on other USB 3 connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In retrospect, I should have tested the mouse/keyboard lag with <em>nothing else connected at all</em> - but one is always wiser afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: Unfortunately, it's not only the drivers.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>While it certainly didn't hurt to get these things in order, the issues reoccurred a little bit later. Doing a bit more experiments with the docking station, it
<em>seems</em> that the problem is always occurring when the Ethernet cable is also connected to the link. Might it just be a bandwidth issue?
</p>
<p>Strangely, I never noticed this under win7 on my old laptop. Maybe win10 is just way more often calling over the network than win7 did?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, luckily, the <em>Dell Precision 7530</em> has a separate LAN connector slot, so I don't need to plug-in via the DisplayLink. (I had to, for the M3800) If I connect the Ethernet via that plug, and the keyboard/mouse/monitors(2) via the DisplayLink,
 I seem to be fine and without lags.</p>
<p>I can live with that, although it would have been nice to run all via the DisplayLink (and then have a USB 3 switch between various machines.)</p>

    <title>Audio Feedback On Mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fourpart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Feedback On Mic</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I plug in the Mic I get screeching Audio Feedback.</p>
<p>When I was using XP &amp; earlier this problem was easily solved by checking Mute on the Mic option in the Volume Mixer.&nbsp; However, the Windows 7 version doesn't seem to work in the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep hearing the 'solutions' to turn down the speakers when using the mic, but these are not&nbsp;solutions, just workarounds, like fixing a hole in a bucket by not putting water in it.</p>
<p>I want to be able to use my mic together with webcam on voice conference programs such as Live Messenger &amp; PalTalk, but the feedback makes this impossible.</p>
