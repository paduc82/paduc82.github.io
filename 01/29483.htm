<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire IOS Freecell Bug</h2>
                    <p>I installed the IOS version of Solitaire and have been trying to play the daily challenges, but I keep running into a bug while playing Freecell games.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know all cards have to be placed sequentially and red on black and black on red, but there are time when the game won't let me move a stack onto another one, so for example, I had Q(R)-J(B)-10(R)-9(B)-8(R)-7(B)-6(R)-5(B) and wanted to move it onto a black
 King, which should be valid as the Queen was red, but the game insisted it wasn't a valid move and forced me to return them.&nbsp; This is making completing games really tricky as if a move is deemed&nbsp;as invalid, it can&nbsp;make progression impossible.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Casual games community is just other players like yourself since I don't think there is any&nbsp;technical support on that site anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft usually patches bug's in their casual games pretty fast so just make sure the app is updated from your app store. You can always uninstall the app and re-install to make sure you have the latest version.</p>

<p>To add on, even though there is no official&nbsp;support there. It's a great place to get community support so might not be a bad idea to head on over there.</p>

<p>Actually that is how Freecell works, you can move a number of card based on the free cells you have available. In the screen you provide you have one free cell on top right (unless you got the pile from there) and one free cell in the four single slots on
 top. This means you can actually move 3 (2) cards maximum at a time. Since you have 8 in the pile, that is not a valid move. No bugs there.</p>
<p>What you're trying to do would be valid in games like klondike or spider where there's no limit to the stack.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 boots to Windows Recovery Environment</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> Automatic repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus TP300L. I started out with WIN8 and upgraded to WIN 10 2 months ago. Just yesterday I had problems starting up my computer after I did an upgrade and shut down. I have tried to restart multiple times with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Know when I turn on the computer it goes directly to automatic repair. I go to advanced options and now I'm in the choose an option part. I have 4 options, first option is, continue - exit and continue to Windows 8.1 ????? I have been using Windows 10 so
 I don't understand that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next option is, use a device. I can only use the usb drive or internet connection. My computer did not come with a usb drive for recovery. And Internet is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next is trouble shoot. I tried to refresh my PC and that does not work. And I can't reset my computer. I need data that is on this computer. And advanced options has been tried with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final is turn off PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am am lost and confused. Main reason is that I have downloaded and have been working with Windows 10 for a couple months. But now it is saying continue to Windows 8.1. I'm guessing this is the problem but I have no idea how to resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many help please.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the delayed response.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform Startup Repair by creating a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Media Creation Tool</span></span></span></span></strong></a><span><span>.
 Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the below mentioned steps.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startup Repair</strong> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem, and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and then start the computer.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Press a key when you are prompted. </p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Click the operating system that you want to repair and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options &gt; Startup Repair</strong></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 64-Bit - Problems with Windows Update errors &#40;800703F1 and 8007371C&#41; and Windows Update Agent failure</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a Gateway NE56R47U which came with
<strong>Windows 8 - 64bit</strong> pre-installed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve had a problem downloading and installing window updates for this laptop since
<strong>December 2013, </strong>along<strong> </strong>with subsequent <strong>800703F1</strong> and
<strong>8007371C</strong> errors<strong>.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>I want to get all the Windows 8 updates downloaded, so I can upgrade to
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> – then ultimately upgrade to <strong>Windows 10.</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span>In the past week I've tried numerous attempts to run the <em>sfc scan</em>,
<em>dism tool</em> and <em>windows update (fixit)</em> <em>troubleshooter </em>to correct the automatic downloading of windows updates with limited success.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reviewing the windows update log, it states the '<strong>Windows Update Agent 7.8.9200.1694 failed'
</strong><span>message at least 8 times.</span> This has produced the two separate errors
<strong>(800703F1</strong> and <strong>8007371C)</strong>, from all subsequent tries.<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>How do I get these errors resolved?</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>In an attempt to fix the
<em>winupdt agent</em> issue, I was directed to update to <strong><em>‘the latest version of the windows</em>
<em>update agent’</em> – <em>KB2937636</em>’</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This update installation
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">failed</span></strong> – <em>without any application error code.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking at my
<em>wuaueng.dll</em> file, it states the <em>‘product version and file version’</em> is
<strong>7.8. 9200.16731’ </strong>was<strong> </strong>created on <em>10/8/2013</em>. &nbsp;I find it had to believe this is the most current version for this file.<span>&nbsp; I</span>s this a viable stand-alone downloadable option?<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is <em>the latest WU Agent file for Windows 8 – 64 bit?</em><span>&nbsp; </span>
Most importantly, how do I get this fixed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then attempted to download the winupdts again, and received the error message
<strong>800703F1</strong>, and clicked the <em>‘try again’</em> button.<span>&nbsp; </span>
<em>This time the updates began downloading <strong>83 important</strong> <strong>
updates.</strong> </em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After they downloaded and began the installation at around 13%, I received the message
<strong><em>‘Failure configuring Windows updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Reverting changes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Do not turn off your computer.’ <span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>When I reviewed the update history, all
<strong><em>83 important updates</em></strong> <strong><em>had failed.</em></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span>There was one error code of <strong>8007041D</strong>, the rest were split evenly between the same
<strong>800703F1</strong>, <strong>8007371C</strong> error codes.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong> I read&nbsp;in the community (MS MVP) support - the prerequisites for Windows&nbsp;are
<strong>KB2917499, KB2871389, KB2885699 </strong>and<strong> KB2871777</strong>.&nbsp; They were not included in these updates.&nbsp; I'm assuming they will be in other updates after this problem is fixed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I re-ran&nbsp;the
<strong><em>sfc scan</em></strong>, <strong><em>dism tool</em></strong>, both came back clean. I re-ran the
<strong><em>windows update (fixit) trouble</em></strong> <strong><em>shooter, </em>
</strong>which reported three separate problems with the<strong><em>‘Service registration is missing or corrupt’, ‘Windows Update error 0x80070057(2015-03-04-T-10_55_38P)’ and ‘Problems installing recent updates’.
</em></strong>The troubleshooter stated it ‘fixed’ all of these problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then turned off
<strong><em>‘automatic downloading and installation’</em></strong> of windows updates and rebooted the pc.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At some point, another batch of <em>83 important updates</em> again were downloaded to my pc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have held off installing them again.<span>&nbsp; </span>As I wanted to inform the community for assistance with my findings, with the hope of getting as much corrective measures with this scenario, the group comes up with.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then install the 83 updates, with the hopes of them installing correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your assistance …………..</span></p>

<h2>            Installed windows 10, sound suddenly not working.</h2>
                    <p>Once I upgraded to windows 10, I was eager to get started, but I realized, there was absolutely no audio from my speakers. I have tried it in both rear speaker jacks, and front headphone jacks, using both my speaker, and my headphones. I have uninstalled

            <p>in device manager, I've got Nvidia audio, but that's never been an issue before, as Realtek has been what's been installed, and I've been using it without an issue, so that's the one I'll be posting first, but I'll attach an image at the end of this post
 showing the two other sound controllers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to hardware compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and check if they have any compatible drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you don't find any compatible drivers for Windows 10, download drivers for Windows 8/8.1 and then install it using compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about compatibility, refer to the below article, which will help you to install programs and launch it&nbsp;using compatibility:</p>

            Thanks for the input. To make certain, I've downloaded the latest Realtek driver, and ran it as administrator, in compatibility mode for windows 8. It installed, demanded a restart. As soon as the restart was complete, it installed another realtek driver,
 and demanded another restart. (Audio was still not available then.) So I performed the second requested restart, and the issue still persists. My playback devices have a reacting bar to show that there is sound being put through, yet neither speakers nor headphones
 respond at all.

<p>"requires further installation" usually means that it needs a reboot to finish installing. Have you rebooted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, to be 100% sure on this, you should uninstall (and delete the driver files when prompted), reboot, get the drivers reinstalled, reboot, and then see if it works. A bit of a pain, I know, and most people don't need to go through it but I'd like
 to know if it works for you.</p>

            Just an update. I've tried restarting the services, removing the audio drivers, manually installing realtek, letting windows install them, changing my ports used, speaker settings, bit rates, different speakers, so on, and so forth. As far as windows can
 tell, my speakers are working fine, yet I've got nothing else coming out. I'm actually considering downgrading to 7, but if I do that, will I be able to re-upgrade for free later on when this issue might be fixed?

</p><p>That was the event log for one of the attempts. Following Vinoth's suggestion the installation was complete and I did reboot. However, the result is the same: No Audio Output Device is installed.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>No gain without pain, although the gain doesn't seem nigh. I hope that I will not have to return to Windows 7 for some problem that seems fixable. Thanks for the support :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 Product Key Reset</h2>
                    Uhm Hi._.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I was trying to activate my Office and stuff.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I found a software called KMSpico. The software activates your Office 2013 and your Windows if it isint activated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Picture BelowV</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11c04a4c-62be-4d83-a45a-dfd2c3ed32c4" /></div>
<div>So I was intending to Activate my Office 2013 not Windows, since it already was.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So i did the token backup stuff. And it somehow deactivated my Windows._.</div>
<div>The program started and it activated my Laptop again. But the key was a "Trial" type. That lasted for 30 days.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched the key up. And it was a key that was being showed as a free winsows product key. But it was only Trial.</div>
<div>So i regret this now._. and I really want my proper key now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I heard that the PC's Original key is stored into the BIOS. Would there be a way the locate it there and get it?</div>
<div>Will Refreshing my laptop change the Key to normal? or do I need to Factory Reset it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEAASSEE Help :) Since i;m studying and I dont want my Sony Vaio running with a trial key i'd rather be with an original key.</div>
<div><br />

<p>This is a programming error of the program you use.</p>
<p>The tool doesn't check the input and tries to convert the string/text "mysql_co" to a double (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.double.aspx) which is not possible!</p>

<h2>            My icons are gone and big blue boxes appear when I try to create new icons.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my wife was on my computer doing who knows what, when return to it the next day , it's like a different computer. All of my desktop icons are missing, when I try to add new ones, sometimes it adds it in the form of a large blue box with
 the icon inside, sometimes I click add desktop icon and nothing happens. Apparently the few icons that I have managed to add are in a "group" and i can rename the group if I wish. If that info helps determine the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A weird thing is, lets say I have a downloader minimized; when I go over to the task bar and hover over the minimized downloader ( or any application for that matter) the little box appears next to it as normal that displays what will pop up
 if you click it. But when I move my mouse to hover over the actual image of the small box that appeared, my old icons are back! but only while I hover over that tiny display box. when I move the mouse away, they are gone and the new layout is back... ikr !!?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another weird thing is I cannot right-click on my desktop. All that empty space with no icons and when I right click, absolutely nothing happens at all. No little menu pops up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried searching for an answer, many people have had their icons go missing but I can't find anyone else with this exact problem nor solution that works to be able to have normal icons on my desktop again. It's weird because when I see
 them for a split second when I hover over the task bar application tiny display box when i hover over an active application, it makes me think some weird setting or program is running and I just need to figure out how to disable it to have all of my old,normal
 icons reappear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm usually pretty savvy in fixing problems but this one has been stumping me for quite sometime. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It appears that these blue boxes I have with the icons in them, are "pinned to start." When I tell a program to "Pin to Start," that is when they show up where my icons used to be. When I choose "create desktop icon," nothing happens. Apparently these
 new "icons" are an extension of my Start menu, hope that helps. c:</p>

<h2>            WiFi dropping constantly because of 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with same SSIDs</h2>
                    <p>My WiFi works for a few minutes, and then I get the yellow triangle with exclamation mark.&nbsp; The only way to get back the connection is to right-click and select "Troubleshoot problems".&nbsp; Each time the connection will be back for a few minutes again, until
 I get the same symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The detailed report of the Troubleshoot shows 'excessive' switching between multiple networks.&nbsp; I have a 2.4GHz n, and 5GHZ ac/n network in my house with the same SSID.&nbsp; None of my other devices (older tablets, Android phones, W10 laptops) have any problem
 whatsoever.&nbsp; Pretty pathetic that Surface 3 is struggling with this.&nbsp; Shame on Microsoft for putting out such a pos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can set the Marvel Avastar network adapter to 5GHz only, and then I have noticed the connection stays up.&nbsp; However, signal is weak on the Surface 3.&nbsp; I still need to check if the connection stays when I limit to only 2.4GHz.&nbsp; In any case, this is not a
 real solution, as the network adapter should work as designed and select the best connection available.&nbsp; Especially when roaming, which is really where you buy a tablet for anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are up to date (windows does not find a newer one), and W10 is also up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How and when does this get fixed?</p>

            <p>It looks like you are in a semi&nbsp;business environment, as you mention handing off and load balancing (you also mention your home, but the Fortinet gear is normally used for business/soho). I suspect your issue may not occur with other routers, but when you
 say "Also, I need to restrict the 'handoff' among access points.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as&nbsp;I allow two access points (both only on channel 1) to handoff clients (for load balancing), the Surface can't deal with this and drops the connection." this looks more like a business
 configuration for roaming. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your next step is to contact Surface for Business. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows 10 High DWM.exe and CSRSS.exe GPU usage</h2>
                    Hello, I have a problem when I am gaming. Whenever I game i get a stable smooth 100 fps. But then after 5 minutes in my fps drops to about 10 - 20 so the game is unplayable. It happens with every game I play, not just one. I have researched a bit to why
 this is happening. People say I have a bitcoin virus disguised as these 2 tasks. I have run numorous anti virus programs and searched everything on malwarebytes but every anti virus including malwarebyte logs there is no virus present. Please help because
 i am unable to game what so ever. I reinstalled all GPU drivers and everything.

<p>Both&nbsp; DWM (Windows desktop management), and CRSS (Client Service Runtime Process) are important Windows functions.</p>
<p>One potential cause of your games loosing fps would be if Windows Updates is downloading something in the background while you</p>
<p>are running a game (particularly if you have not already done a large 'feature' update such as 1709 ).</p>
<p>- I haven't heard if it affects other games, but Far Cry3 will crash after 15 min if Table Mode (In Settings &gt; System).</p>
<p>- A corrupt&nbsp; (or infected) User profile can also cause issues with CRSS . </p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a bit coin malware disguising as one of these services it would likely be using a
<em>lot</em> of cpu cycles, but I would think it would be</p>
<p>more likely to use the extra resources when not gaming, so as not to give itself away.
</p>
<p>Check in <em>Task Manager &gt; Performance</em> to verify if either of these functions are using a
<em>lot</em> of resources, either with no game running,</p>
<p>or at the time a game starts to lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You may have more than one CRSS running (I have two atm). You can verify if they are legit by R/clicking on the Process and clicking on
</p>
<p><em>Open File Location.</em></p>
<p>This should take you to System32 if the process is legit, and there should be only one CRSS.exe in System32, which will be highlighted.
</p>
<p>If you are not able to open the file location (and you are logged on with an Admin account ), or you are taken to another location,</p>
<p>that particular process.CRSS.exe <em>may</em> be bogus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your games are not recently installed the problem may be due to a software conflict. Your Anti-virus, Skype, Daemon Tools, and</p>
<p>any number of other software have potential to cause conflicts.</p>
<p>Programs that have auto update functions can also cause fps drops Particularly if they do a search for an update while you have</p>
<p>the system under load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've read that a lot of 'free' download sites have begun turning machines into bit coin mining machines, but not via malware.</p>
<p>They are apparently doing this with the 'permission' of the owner (user agreement that many don't read), and installing a legit bit coin
</p>
<p>mining tool which does not get flagged as a malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

<h2>            XP Pro can&#39;t see itself in network places</h2>
                    <p>Ok, here's a good one, my XP Pro SP3&nbsp;machine doesn't show up in the workgroup (named workgroup) that consists of (2) "7" machines and (1) "98" machine and a Ubee router.&nbsp;I can't even see the XP machine listed when i'm at it (unless i type the address in
 the address bar). It's ping-able from all machines and until a few minutes ago (divine intervention i think) was getting "not authorized" error if i tried to gain access by the computer name in the address bar (windows explorer) though i can now.&nbsp;I'm running
 DHCP, F&amp;P sharing is enabled, NetBios over tcp/ip is enabled, firewall exceptions are set properly, simple file sharing is disabled&nbsp;and i installed LLTD responder. I did toy with the computer browser settings (auto, yes, no). And...</p>

            <p>Something went terribly wrong with your cut/paste of the output of some unstated "ipconfig" command on&nbsp;some unstated computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try transferrring the data via Windows Notepad to remove screen formatting and add the original command and some explanation
 for posting this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure why we have all this random TCP/IP information in a basic local Windows for Workgroups network because WFW uses NETBIOS (which is not TCP/IP). Before someone posts about NBT (Netbios over TCP/IP) I am aware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time for you to do some research into the "nbtstat" and "net" commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the Windows 98 computer is by far the lowest common denominator in your network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Have you tried the Networking Wizard on the Windows 7 computer? it can produce the configuration files for the XP computer.</p>

            <p>Methyl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of trying to show how much you know and how much i don't, try focusing on the topic, which by the way is fairly well stated, and get on with the job of trying to help. Or not.</p>
<p>The output of the "unstated" ipconfig command (ipconfig/all) seems quite legible to me and you'd have known what it was if you were indeed "all that". The problem is&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;my machine (XP Pro SP3) and it not showing up in Explorer style network map, on
 itself or the other machines. It is ping-able from all machines and can be accessed (sometimes)&nbsp;by typing the computer name in the explorer address bar. Now, let's get down to causes and conditions please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much</p>

            Despite the comments from another poster, the output from ipconfig /all looks pretty normal, EXCEPT that despite your statement that "NetBios over tcp/ip is enabled," there's no indication of that in the ipconfig output.&nbsp; There should be a line, which
 usually appears just after the DNS server addresses, that says "NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled".<br />
<br />
Note that if NetBIOS over TCP/IP is not enabled, there's no status message to that effect.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://networking.nitecruzr.net/2006/04/netbios-over-tcpip.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://networking.nitecruzr.net/2006/04/netbios-over-tcpip.html</a><br />
<br />
I suspect that this may be the cause of your problem.&nbsp; See <a href="http://networking.nitecruzr.net/2005/05/browstat-utility-from-microsoft.html#NotActive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Interestingly enough, I tried looking at "Workgroup computers" on the Windows XP Mode virtual instance on my Win 7 machine and it was blank ... but running browstat status resulted in "Browsing is not active on domain" and the Computer Browser service wouldn't
 stay started.&nbsp; I didn't dig any deeper into that.&nbsp; When I fired up my old XP Pro box, its "Workgroup computers" screen showed everything ... including the XP Mode "machine."<br />

            <p>Re-read my post and it was a bit brusque. There are lines missing or corrupted from the original "ipconfig /all"&nbsp; (notaby the "Media State" line).&nbsp;&nbsp; You also report vague error symptoms but not the exact commands typed and the exact error, or mention which
 computer in the workgroup was used at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "nbtstat" and "browstat" output is interesting. My XP SP3 doesn't have "browstat".&nbsp;Only ever&nbsp;seen&nbsp;"browstat" on Windows servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My opinion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that what you are trying to configure is a Windows for Workgroups workgroup&nbsp;called "WORKGROUP". Probably to share files and printers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that you need any reference to a Domain whatsoever in a Workgroup. In fact a Domain called "WORKGROUP" will clash with a Workgroup called "WORKGROUP".&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw this once where&nbsp;a company name had been used for both.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversely if you are trying to set up a Domain you will need a Domain Controller and control who is the Browse Master.</p>

            <p>Pa Bear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the reply. Yes, it is the same machine and it does belong to me. As stated I re-installed the OS and all is working well except this failure to be "seen". Good point, very good. It isn't a clean install, it's a "write-over" and perhaps that's
 an issue. And yes, i DO use a registry cleaner (RegistryMechanic, paid for copy) but no anti-virus except windows firewall and definately no "speed-up" programs. I have 23 processes that run when the machine is "at rest" and I'm very cognizant of what my machine
 does. Though it's a simple matter to work around this and the machine runs flawlessly, I want to solve this issue and find what I've overlooked. LemP above mentioned that since i do have NBT enabled, it should reflect that in the ipconfig/all command. Curious
 indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for your help satisfying my curiosity.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My surface uses Windows PRO x64, so I had to download the x64 PRO version of the ISO. While my others use Premium so you download the home version. Ensure you are using the correct one otherwise it asks for your key. Oh, and the official Microsoft post above

            <p>Hello EarlWhitney</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 comes in 5 different versions:</p>
<p>Home, Home Single Language, Home N, Pro, and Pro N.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Most of time, people face problems such as errors in the automated Windows 10 upgrade. So they decide to download the ISO from Microsoft, which then asks them the Product key.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a Windows Media Creation tool to download these versions, which can be found here:
</p>
<span>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Media Creation Tool">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First of all, right click on your "My Computer" or "This PC" and go to Properties. There, see which version of Windows 7, or 8 or 8.1 you're using. Look for specifics like "<strong>Home</strong>", "<strong>Home Single Language</strong>", "<strong>Pro",
 "</strong><strong>Pro VN</strong>" etc.</li><li>Let's say you use <strong><em>Windows 8 Home Single Language. Most of the branded PCs and Laptops always give preinstalled versions of Home Single Language Windows.</em></strong></li><li>Also, look for the 32-bit or 64-bit version. </li><li>And at last, look specifically for which language you're using. Mostly it's English (US) but you should cross-check.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Then, download the Media Creation Tool (32-bit or 64-bit depending on which Windows version you're using), open it, wait for it to load the interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>There, choose the Language,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;version carefully.
</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For example, if you're using Windows 8.1 in English (UK) and you choose English (US) for Windows 10, it might not work.
</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, choose the Windows 10 version pertaining to the same version of Windows you're using before. For example, For
<strong>Windows 8 Home Single Language</strong>, you must choose <strong>Windows 10 Home Single Language.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The tool will automatically download and create the <em>Windows.ISO </em>file in your Documents folder. Copy it to a USB drive or DVD. Open that drive, open the ISO file.</p>
<p>Windows 8 and 8.1 have built-in ISO mounting so you only need to double click the ISO file. In Windows 7, you may need a third-party mounting software to run the ISO file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if you did everything as I described, and you're using a genuine version of Windows, the Windows 10 Setup WILL NOT ASK FOR A PRODUCT KEY. This will update your Windows to Windows 10, if you choose, it will keep all your installed applications, accounts,
 personal files, even drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make a bootable DVD or USB from that ISO, and try to boot from that media and install Windows, it will definitely ask for a Product key, and it will NOT be an upgrade. It will only be a fresh install. You may lose all your files and installed applications
 and drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank me later.</p>

<h2>            Wireless adapter driver needs reinstalling everytime I turn computer on - Windows 8 Problem</h2>
                    I've been running Windows 8 Pro 32-bit for a few days now - my issue is that my wireless adapter driver needs reinstalling every time I turn my PC on.<br />
<br />
Firstly I suspect its simply going to be a case that the older model is not compatible with Windows 8 but I wanted to check with others before I go out and buy a new model.<br />
<br />
I'm currently using Belkin G USB adapter - model F5D7050 - I believe Belkin are no longer updating drivers for this model to bring it up to date with WIndows 8. The driver I reinstall every time is the most recent one available on the Belkin Support site.
<br />
<br />
Once I've reinstalled the driver I have to re-enter the network key again and then its works fine for hours but after a period of time it disconnects and my computer displays that no Ethernet cable is connected to the computer - prompting me to reinstall once
 again. <br />
<br />
Does any one have any ideas why this could be happening??<br />
<br />
A further issue i'm having is that the computer wont shut down fully. It used to then yesterday it acted as if shutting down but just returned to the login screen. Any help with this would be appreciated too.<br />
<br />
Happy to provide more system details if needed to solve this issue - I'd rather not have to buy new devices - frankly i'd rather have vista back.
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
Catherine<br />

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite
 what many people think, and what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems,
 they would disappear from the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner,
 running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span></p>

    <title>NAS Shares on the Network &#40;Group Policy Solutions&#41; 550 chmod - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crakdkorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            NAS Shares on the Network &#40;Group Policy Solutions&#41;  550 chmod 777 &#60;filename&#62; permission denied</h2>
                    <p>After running into a problem with Windows 10 updates disabling SAMBA version 1 (SMB1) and knowing the TP-LINK router uses SMB1 for sharing, the fix was to create the share as a "local only" ftp share on the network over port 21.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a nice solution.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Unfortunately there are restrictions.&nbsp; If a file is copied to a parent folder and there is a desire to move it to a child folder, it appears the only way around it is to copy the parent contents to my documents of desktop, save it there, then delete it from
 the NAS share, then copy it from my documents or desktop back to the sub folder.&nbsp; (Sorry, for the sound of disdain in my voice here but...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there are way to enable the NAS without all the restrictions that are normally encountered via FTP?&nbsp; Remember, this is not internet FTP.&nbsp; This is local FTP behind the NAT and behind the firewall, and protected by the domain etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist.&nbsp; Security is the top priority, but it would be nice to have security AND a working computer at the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I can go mow the grass.&nbsp; Do the Bolshevik thing and keep the neighbors happy, but I'd rather just do a copy and paste here on my domain.&nbsp; Lord knows there are war driving prowlers and if I am lucky, I can catch a glimpse while mowing the lawn and
 report them to the internet police.&nbsp; &nbsp;I promise... if I see one of those evil war drivers prowling, I will immediately speak up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the answer may be to enable it via group policy.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is difficult to follow group policy changes from the perspective of a layperson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, it is clear the FTP permissions provide Read Write and Execute to All Users, Group, and Owner.&nbsp; It isn't really making sense that the files can be copied, but not moved or deleted.&nbsp; Also, the permission to change the permission is not there.&nbsp; &nbsp;"550
 chmod 777 &lt;filename&gt; permission denied"&nbsp; I saw this but it clearly does not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20313438/changing-permissions-on-windows-for-ftp-via-xampp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20313438/changing-permissions-on-windows-for-ftp-via-xampp</a></p>

<p>How about a completely "out of the box" solution....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not purchase a cheap Network Attached Storage (NAS) box to add to your network.&nbsp; That way, you'd be able to use SMBv3 on the NAS box and not have to deal with all of the cr*p that you're dealing with now</p>

                    Are you in need of a support group after the initial trauma of realizing how horrible Windows 8 actually is? Are you traumatized every day when trying to use Windows 8? Are you trying to come to terms with the fact that you may have to endure working with
 Windows 8 for the next few years? Complain, rant or write whatever you need to do here in order to take out your frustration in a non-violent manner. Just don't throw your laptops out of Windows ;) - it's not the laptop's fault, it's Windows 8's fault. Please

Are you saying that things should be harder to operate and not easier? So we can recognize the intelligence of those who figure out how to use it?

            Sure, but a rat learns a maze. Did it make him/her smarter? Only nominally. The rat is still subject to the reality, terms, and conditions placed before it by those with no more regard for that poor rat than to make of him/her exactly what they have.

Everyone needs to take a ****. 



To make your life more pleasant - 


1) Install Start8 and ModernMix from Stardock software. 


2) Run in Desktop Mode if you do not like the Metro or Modern UI. 


3) Buy a book or download an online guide to Windows 8 and actually read it. 


4) Keep a list of keyboard shortcuts on your desk for the next few weeks. 


5) Take the time to learn the new OS. You will get out of it what you put into it. Every new interface takes time to learn but if we never changed, we would still be using the command line and DOS 1.1. 



Windows 8 is faster, more secure and more flexible than earlier versions of Windows. I have a 4 year old computer and Windows 8 runs much faster on it than the original Vista OS. If you don`t like the new UI, you don`t have to use it. The touchscreen experience is much better but once you learn the keyboard and mouse shortcuts, these work fine too. 


Breathe deep and learn.

<h2>            Windows 7 Internet connection</h2>
                    <p>My wife's Windows 7 computer has suddenly quit connecting to the internet unless my main computer is connected. Previously it connected even if it is the only computer turned on. With my machine connected everything works fine. I have made no changes to
 either machine.</p>
<p>I have no bridge installed but that is what it acts like. Ihave checked the various settings such as the gateway and see no problem.</p>
<p>I am not knowledgable on networking.</p>
<p>I just want her to be able to turn her machine on and connect to the internet as it did before.</p>
<p>I am on a wireless internet provider and it has worked well for several years. I am using a Linksys router.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be many reasons why you are unable to connect to the Internet using your wife's Windows 7 computer. One of these is due to the network's configuration settings. For us to effectively assist you in rectifying the connection issue, supply more information
 by answering these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you getting any error messages when trying to connect to the Internet?</li><li>Have you tried to directly connect to your wife's computer using a wired setup?</li><li>What steps have you taken so far to resolve the concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Your response is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. The computers are hard wired for the network. I removed all cables from the router except the wifes computer and all units turned off and her computer will not connect. It just shows "no internet connection". I can ping the router
 with hers being the only unit turned on as well as if my computer is on. The Gateway address is correct when I check it. The network map looks OK. The red X is between the network and the internet on the network and sharing map. Everything works fine when
 my machine is connected. It is only an inconvenience that she has to turn on my machine to use hers. This has been just the past several months and hers worked great before that. I made no changes so at that time I suspected a malware but all security scans
 find no malware. Just a frustrating mystery. I am not good at networking so I guess that makes it more frustrating.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>Please clarify the relationship of the following two statements:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">(a)&nbsp; I am on a wireless internet provider</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(b) The computers are hard wired for the network. </p>

</p><p>What is the model of your Linksys router as shown on the label on the back or bottom of the device?&nbsp; If there is a hardware version, please include that as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Linksys routers have 4 Ethernet (or LAN) ports and one Internet (or WAN) port.&nbsp; If your router is like this ...<br />

<p>Given that you apparently know how to look at the Gateway address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the Gateway address, and is it the same for both computers?</li><li>What is your computer's IPv4 address?</li><li>What is your wife's computer's IPv4 address?</li><li>Do the answers for your wife's computer (Gateway and IP address) change depending on whether your computer is on or off?</li></ul>

<p>What I mean is I am on a wireless internet provider which is Casair.net</p>
<p>My network is hardwired, I am not using the wireless network except for a printer/scanner. The machines are hard wired to the router.</p>
<p>The router is a Linksys Access Point Router model BEFW1154 Ver2</p>
<p>It says Etherfast Wireless AP + cable DSL router w/ 4 port switch.</p>
<p>The internet cable for the wireless internet is in the WAN port.</p>
<p>The uplink port is connected to an expansion switch by Netgear. The only ting in the expansion switch is printers.</p>
<p>I disconnected that switch and disconnected every thing except the wifes machine while trying different things.</p>
<p>No matter what I did it changed nothing.</p>
<p>My machine Gateway address is 192.168.1.1&nbsp; and the IP4 is 192.168.1.103</p>
<p>Wifes Gateway address is 192.168.1.1 IP4 is 192.168.1.106</p>
<p>The Gateway addresses do not change but the IP4 address changes to 192.168.1.104</p>
<p>I hope I answered everything.</p>

<p>It may not be your issue, but...</p>
<p>When I have a device on my home network that can connect to the network but not the internet, it's usually a problem with the DNS settings. &nbsp;You could first try to flush the DNS cache on your wife's computer by opening an Administrator Command Prompt and
 typing: ipconfig /flushDNS</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, also compare your DNS settings to your wife's. &nbsp;I've had devices' DNS settings change for no apparent reason. &nbsp;Your ISP probably provides a DNS server, but Google has some reliable ones too, at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (those are for IPV4
 protocol). &nbsp;For IPV6 you can use&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. This may continue to happen due to a conflict with the other device's network adapter since you are not encountering the same challenge on your own network and PC. For us to rectify your network concern, we suggest that you uninstall
 and reinstall the network adapter. Make sure to reboot the device before reinstalling it. This will allow us to isolate if there are any underlying issues on her computer's network adapter.</p>

<h2>            Amazon Kindle on Surface - Problem with Highlighting using Pen</h2>
                    <p>When I try to use the Surface Pro (original) pen with Amazon 80% of the time when I highlight something in a book , the Surface Pro jumps like magic to a different page.&nbsp; This problem is reproductible consistently and doesnt matter if its the app or browser
 version of Kindle.</p>
<p>Could it be my pen?&nbsp; Do I have yet another defective Surface Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing but trouble with my Surface Pro.&nbsp; This is my second.&nbsp; I wish Microsoft would just give me a replacement Surface Pro 2 instead please.</p>
<p>This one overheats and now Kindle wont work right.</p>
<p>What a nuisance having this overpriced, overheating, only partially functioning equipment is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this trouble with Kindle on Surface Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Joshua Lieder</p>

            I got a tip from a friend who has a Surface and noted the newest versions of Amazon Kindle do not work consistently with the digitizer pen.&nbsp; I downloaded&nbsp;a much earlier working version of Amazon Kindle and everything seems better.&nbsp; I am going to labor
 and struggle on with this hardware.&nbsp; I think my initially return period has now passed too anyway.&nbsp; Sigh.
