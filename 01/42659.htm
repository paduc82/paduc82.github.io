<h2>            Annoying fan noise ... and sometimes overheat.</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp; a surface book intel icore i7-6600 CPU @ 2 core</p>
<p>on windows pro 10 at version 10.0.16299 build 16299.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface book fan noise is annoying as hell. it comes in two&nbsp; flavors:</p>
<p>when the fan is not going wild, it's pitching high tone and very irritating.</p>
<p>When the fan goes wild, it is unbearable, then it's no longer so pitching high tone</p>
<p>but you can hear the full blast of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often it heats up wildly, ... in particular related to google chrome and the sites that I frequent.</p>
<p>Which include nytimes.com bloomberg.com and other sides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OFten though it heats up without any external side visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most hellish thing about this devilish advice is that I cannot open it up, nor can I actually&nbsp;</p>
<p>visit any surface book shop as they are not located in my country. What the hell is this for</p>
<p>a supporting community outreach.&nbsp; It's like 0 support. And I am very reluctant&nbsp;</p>
<p>to send the device in anywhere because of the data on it and because of the fact that I actually need</p>
<p>access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This in retrospect, makes me realize, I made a mistake buying Microsoft. Unlike Apple, there's&nbsp;</p>
<p>basically, 0 support other than a few online apologies and useless suggestions that will probably not even help.</p>

<p>Hi F0X1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hear you on this particular issue and this problem may be caused by either a software or a hardware issue. Please note that this may take several steps for us to be able to fix the actual issue so we would like to ask for your cooperation and reply to
 the thread should the issue continue to persist.<br />
<br />
Let's first get into changing the settings for your Surface Book.<br />
<br />
The fan would normally create a noise when the CPU is being exhausted by the device and the only time this happens is when there are several applications that are using your resources heavily.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first step is for you to see how many applications are running when you experience the noise. What are these specific applications? Try to minimize or close out any unnecessary application and see if the issue would persist.<br />
<br />
The second step is to try to change and modify some settings. For this, please go and look at the lower right of your screen where you can see the system tray. The system tray would display your battery icon. Here are some steps you can do:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click on the battery icon and select Power Options. You would be opening up a window where you can choose your power mode.<br />
2. Click on the highlighted option to "change plan settings" and this is where you can select what your device can do when it goes to sleep, etc.<br />
<br />
If the issues still persist after changing your power plan settings, then we would ask you to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT). To know more about this, please click on

<h2>            Grip in Xbox One Elite Controller Falling Off</h2>
                    Title says it all I suppose, but after using my elite controller for a short while the left hand grip has started to fall out.&nbsp; I am quite disappointed that, given the price point, this would happen.&nbsp; Is there anything that can be done or do I have to
 buy a new one?

<p>I have had my Elite Controller for almost three years, and use it daily. And no rubber grips or bumper buttons came off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same is true for the Elite controllers of two of my friends. Also, compared to how many Elite Controllers were sold, and how "few" people complain about these issues, I don't think it's a manufacturing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what I imagine is, since the rubber grips add more grip and friction, I sometimes see my guests (especially new players) gripping the controllers harder than necessary, and twisting their hands around the grip, as if they were twisting a motorbike
 throttle. This is not an issue for the "slippery" plastic-only controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since the rubber grips make the Elite less slippery, the added friction makes the pads stick to the hand more, and if you also (subconsciously) twist your hand like some of my guests, there is nothing physically able to keep the rubber pads in place,
 no matter how expensive the controller is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also consider this: When you wrap your fingers around the rubber pads, and then tighten the grip, the fleshy part on the inside of your fingers get "thicker". The added "padding" on the fingers makes the palm of the hand move "downwards" just a little bit,
 and if you grip the controller tightly, the downward movement scrapes and rubs down on the pad. The tighter you hold the controller, the stronger the pulling force is on the pad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my opinion, it's not a manufacturing issue, but more a way how "engaged" players can get in a heated match, which causes them to grip and squeeze the controller unnecessarily hard, which causes the pad to come off.</p>

<p>You guys are lucky. Every single person I know in real life that has an Elite controller has had them fail or break within a year. In my opinion, it's one of the worst consumer products in the last decade in regards to build quality.</p>

            It's a very prevalent issue. &nbsp;Mine did the same thing. I know others with the same issue. &nbsp;I won't buy another. I may try a SCUFF controller instead. The elite controllers are excellent minus the grip issue. I wish they would try to resurrect the original
 air flow controllers from the original xbox. &nbsp;Those were the best.&nbsp;

Hello VernalThe Devil, releasing the rubber grip at the ELITE gamepad is, unfortunately, an occasional problem, but it is already working on the second version of the ELITE gamepad where this problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
If you have a gamepad under warranty (as a standard 1 year warranty on the gamepad), send your gamepad to a workshop. Ask for a claim on Microsoft's website.<br />
<br />
If you do not already have a gamepad in the warranty, it is also good to contact a certified service team to repair the gamepad professionally.

<h2>            Live Kernel Event 141 issue ever since return after not using computer</h2>
                    <p>
Ever since I got back from a 6 month trip away from my computer no matter which driver I update to it always crashes and gives me Live Kernel Event 141 which if my reading is right is related to the GPU, but it only happens when games are launched</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I also received Live Kernel 117 once, and I Blue screened with Thread stuck in driver error once as well.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Specs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X</p>
<p>
GPU: Sapphire Radeon Rx Vega 64</p>
<p>
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaw V 16Gb</p>
<p>
MOBO:&nbsp;MSI Gaming AMD Ryzen B350</p>
<p>
PSU:&nbsp;EVGA 650 GQ, 80+ GOLD 650W</p>
<p>
Displays: 2 AOC 144Hz Freesync</p>
<p>
OS: Current Update: 1809 Windows 10 64-Bit</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Honestly, this is a last resort for me I feel like i've tried every possible solution.&nbsp; I have tried 4 or 5 different driver versions each being clean installed via DDU.&nbsp; I have cleaned the slot and the card itself, and messed around with Radeon Wattman thinking
 it was a power draw issue.&nbsp; Updated BIOS to current version, along with all recommended drivers to fix error.&nbsp; No luck though please help</p>

            Hi Shi
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Have you considered downgrading back to Windows 10 1803 and monitor if it still crashes?
<br />
<br />I would also try the following just to make sure:
<br />
<br />- Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />
<br />Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />Reset your BIOS Defaults.

<p><span>Hi QUACKA01,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have wireless network adapter installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This error message is related to Dlink wireless network adapter, if you have any wireless<span>&nbsp;</span>network adapter installed on the
 computer I would suggest that you install the latest updated driver for the adapter by visiting its manufacturer website and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Saadmusejee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The error code which you are getting <strong>Code 45</strong> deals with the drivers for the device which is not working fine. One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This error occurs if a device that was previously connected to the computer is no longer connected. To resolve this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer.<br />
<br />
No resolution is necessary. This error code is only used to indicate the disconnected status of the device and does not require you to resolve it. The error code resolves automatically when you connect the associated device to the computer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may also </span></strong><span>run the hardware troubleshooter and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the ‘<strong>Windows + C’</strong> to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of the screen and you will get the charms menu.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong>search’</strong> and select ‘<strong>settings</strong>’ and type ‘<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>’ and select ‘troubleshooting’.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong>Hardware and Sound’</strong> and select <strong>‘Hardware and Devices’</strong> and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Method 3</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update Drivers</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install. Please refer to the below mentioned article to update the drivers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything works fine after restart then you may check the issue in safe mode and then in clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the link to boot in safe mode.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a

<span>(optiarc BD rom bc-5530H).&nbsp; No longer recognizes any disc DVD-r. DVD+r, CD-r, etc, except bluray.&nbsp; The bluray discs read fine.&nbsp; Now i realize that the optical drive could have gone bad with only one of the lasers, however, I find it extremely
 unlikely that that is the case because it happened immediataly after the Itunes software could not write a simple audio disc for me.&nbsp; I used the drive to write a DVD data disk just an hour before.
<p>I have tried the following; update optical drive drivers, uninstall and reinstall the optical drive, perform a system restore, completely restore the operating system (windows 7) to the factory specs, deleting the upper and lower limits in the sys files.&nbsp;
 I am at a loss!&nbsp; What could be causing this situation?&nbsp; I am about to just go out and buy a cheap external DVD read/write drive, but I would rather have the unit on the laptop (Gateway NV59) working and I do not want to spend the money for a&nbsp;BDROM when that
 portion is funtioning. &nbsp;How silly bluray, but nothing else.&nbsp; Help Please!</p>

            <p>Can you boot from a bootable CD - like a <a href="http://www.ubcd4win.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ultimate Windows Boot CD</a> or <a href="http://https//help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ubuntu Live CD</a><br />
(Quick way to eliminate the 'lasers' being the issue - at least the CD laser.)</p>
<p>You could even make a bootable DVD to verify that laser is working.</p>
<p>Admittedly - you need a working burner on some machine&nbsp;to make either.</p>
<p>Another option...</p>
<p>Make a <a href="http://https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bootable USB drive(USB&nbsp;thumb drive/USB key/USB Flash drive) with Ubuntu</a> and boot to it and try to read CD's and DVDs once you get booted to the LiveCD - don't install it... (*grin*)&nbsp; If it works - then you know there is a software issue in Windows.</p>
<p>Might also try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 in Safe Mode</a> - can you read the contents of CDs and DVDs there?</p>

            The Drive only reads bluray in safe mode also.&nbsp; I am attempting to gain access to a computer to create a boot disk (good idea)...&nbsp; Are the windows 7 " system repair discs" boot disks?&nbsp; I do have one created and that is not recognized upon start up.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I just have a hard time believing that the laser or sensor went out at the exact moment I was using MAC software to burn for the first time.&nbsp; Itunes support site does state that problems like this occur, their solution was to delete the upper and lower filters,
 which i did, to no avail.<br />

            It is by coincidence that the DVD / CD "laser" is no longer working.&nbsp; Since you have tried Safe Mode, it seems to be a "hardware" problem.

            Honestly you may be correct, the more things I try that do not work the more likely that seems...&nbsp; I still hate to purchase an external optical drive if it is a "software" issue.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
One last hing i would like to note; the properties section of the drive does state:&nbsp; "The device is working properly.&nbsp; Windows did not start a related device driver.&nbsp; To learn more click on the driver tab and then driver details.".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm only semi technical, but that seems to me that a driver isn't working... I have messed around with them to no end and can't figure it out.&nbsp; I also can not find the original driver for the optical drive anywhere.&nbsp; I tried the manufacturers website and many
 driver sites.&nbsp; But the system reset to manufacturer settings should have reset all the drivers anyway, correct?<br />

            iTunes have been "noted" to cause recording problems.<br />
<br />
BD / DVD / CD drives all appear to use the built-in Microsoft drivers for read access and in the case of DVD / CD, write access sometimes.<br />
<br />
As for BD recording, you might need to take a look at the recording software that usually should be delivered with a recording drive.

            I also have gateway NV78 and I am having the same problem., but never down loaded from Itunes. Most of my down loading is Mods for The Elder Scrolls III, IV, and V. and Games from Steam.<br />
<br />
Steam was not working properly and a big hassle tried uninstalling it and couldnt get all of it to uninstall ..got mad and deleted the rest.&nbsp; Then my hard drive went had Best Buy replace it, but the optiarc cd rom&nbsp; stopped working a little while after down
 loading a beta mod and removing steam. I dont no why Best Buy did not fix it. I live 40 miles from town and don't drive.. so i just had my son drop it off to fix hard drive and pick up a external hp rm475e.&nbsp; I have all the cds for my games but the Hp only
 reads morrowind. Oblivion and Skyrim it just keeps saying insert disk.,, the disk spins then slows down the repeats this over and over again<br />
. <br />
I finally download steam and reinstalled hoping it word correct it self, for i am not very computer smart like you guys. Also downloaded EScrolls IV and V. they are working ok.,,but when I insert skyrim which has Steam built right in to game annd click add
 game and search drive E it says insert disk. <br />
I was going through my Oblivion.ini it said searching for cd rom cant find cd rom . but said found archive of old oblivion cd.<br />
<br />
I have just given up cant afford another 300.00 @ Best Buy.,,until I saw your post w/same computer and same problem. Oh also I have multi system like 32 &amp; 64 bit &amp; all kinds of windows versions. xp 2003 2008, Vista &amp; Os etc. Hope you get a solution response
 so I can do try it to.&nbsp; SOMEOE PLEASE HAVE ANSWER.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In my C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch folder I have 77 files called things like RUNDLL32.EXE-705FE159.pf, (many of them are Rundll32's.&nbsp; The computer is running a little slow, despite having gone back to factory settings recently and doing a complete "destructive" then
 reinstalling everything again.&nbsp; The screen flickers a little too and when I switch off the computer I often get a RUNDLL32 not closed thingy and have to wait for an end program.</p>
<p>I am not very proficient on a computer so please keep any answers simple please, but have I got anything wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Caroline</p>

<p>Having .pf files in Prefetch is normal. This does not mean your computer is virus/malware-free however. Please review the "slow computer" troubleshooting below, starting with thorough scanning for malware. As I said to the original poster back in March,
 if you can't do the work yourself (and that's OK because we all have our areas of expertise), take the computer to a reputable local professional. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>
<p><span>Some reasons for computer slowness:<br />
<br />
1. Computer hasn't been maintained - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance</a> <br />
<br />
2. Computer is infected with malware - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
3. Hard drive is too full. Remove unnecessary stuff, uninstall unused programs. Don't forget to back up!<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up</a><br />
<br />
4. Flaky third-party software. Toolbars and add-ons are particular culprits in this area. Uninstall toolbars (Google, Yahoo, ISP-branded, etc.) and look carefully at what add-ons are in use in your browser(s).<br />
<br />
5. Computer has too many unnecessary programs/processes running in the background. Manage your Startup:<br />
<br />
For XP - How to Troubleshoot By Using the Msconfig Utility in Windows XP - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560</a> <br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx</a> <br />

<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com</a> <br />
<br />
For Vista/Windows7 - Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a> is also very useful.<br />
<br />
6. User is running a bloated/invasive antivirus program such as ones from Norton and McAfee. Replace with a better program. I recommend either NOD32 (commercial) or Avast (free). Avira is also good but the free version has an unpleasant nag screen (Google for
 instructions as to how to disable this). User may also be running more than one real-time antivirus/firewall/security program.<br />
<br />
7. User has installed new programs that are processor and/or memory-intensive (Photoshop, AutoCAD, Mathmatica or the like) and doesn't have the necessary hardware power.<br />
<br />
8. Hard drive is failing and is in PIO Mode (IDE drives only - not applicable to SATA drives). This is very dramatically slow (like being back in 1985). See Hans-Georg Michna's information here -<a href="http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10</a>
<br />
<br />
If the PIO registry fix doesn't "stick" (or you have a SATA drive), the hard drive is probably failing and should be tested.<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a><br />

In addition to the above, also see <a href="http://miekiemoes.blogspot.com/2008/02/help-my-computer-is-slow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://miekiemoes.blogspot.com/2008/02/help-my-computer-is-slow.html</a> <br />
<br />
Note: If computer has always been slow, in addition to items above user may have purchased a machine with a less powerful processor and not enough RAM (memory). For normal computer use, 512MB-1GB is usually sufficient for XP; Vista should have a minimum of
 2GB; Windows 7 is less demanding than Vista but the minimum of 2GB should also be used.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Marcia1950,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Adding to J W Stuart`s suggestions, check to see if the following steps help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 Windows activated but still says not genuine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you get any error when you tried to re-activate Windows?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any hardware or a software change on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if Windows is activated. If not
 enter the product key and activate online to check for the exact error. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Windows Activation by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer and then clicking Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 if it says “Windows is Activated”. If not, click Change Product Key and enter the product key. Click Next and wait for the process to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help then check to see if this
 article helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-7-activation-error-invalid-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 activation error: invalid product
 key</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If the copy of Windows is already activated and
 you still receive the message that Windows is not genuine, then please visit the following website and click “Validate Windows.”</span></p>

    <title>Monitor won&#39;t work Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyjackson1971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor won&#39;t work Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi - I set my monitor refresh rate to 100hz in Windows 10.&nbsp; I had the check box ticked that says only display rates that will work with the&nbsp;monitor will be displayed, and so I thought it was safe to set this refresh rate because it was being displayed
 in the drop-down box.&nbsp; On rebooting, my monitor will not work now.&nbsp; It features the Windows 10 loading image - and then cuts out with a message to say it will not support the video mode.&nbsp; All I need to do is reset&nbsp;the refresh rate&nbsp;in Windows - however I cannot
 see Windows in order to make the change.&nbsp; I now realise that Windows 10 does not have a Boot to Safe Mode&nbsp;either &nbsp;- and so I am really stuck.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do?

            After spending many days trying to figure out the external monitor problem after I bought new laptop with Windows 10, I went to Big Box store who advised to buy USB to VGA adapter.&nbsp; Did not work.&nbsp; Went to Office Max/Depot and spoke with techie who said
 that monitor won't work in USB port.&nbsp; Purchased HDMI to VGA pigtail adapter (Ativa), plugged it in and IT WORKED!!!&nbsp; Simple solution.<br />

            Amazon discontinued it and the only option is to use the web based Kindle Cloud Reader. Microsoft has no control over when apps are discontinued by third parties. There's also a desktop reader https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp.

<h2>            Upgrading Surface 3 to Windows 10 via Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community! I recently got a Surface 3 that has Windows 8.1 pre-installed on it. My plan is to upgrade it to Windows 10 as soon as possible using the Media Creation Tool provided by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before upgrading however, do I still need to install the&nbsp;latest Windows 8.1 updates to the Surface, or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and have a good day!</p>

    <title>Cannot repair Windows 7 on Toshiba laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pumen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot repair Windows 7 on Toshiba laptop</h2>
                    
<p>Since getting a new Toshiba laptop in October I have had endless issues.&nbsp; This is going to be giant but I assume relevant to the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>My first problems with it came from uninstalling McAfee.&nbsp; I was able to do a full restore (it was new so had nothing to lose except time) and through this forum got a tool for getting rid of everything McAfee.</p>
<p>All fine for a while, using AVG free for antivirus.&nbsp; That was until December when AVG did an update that causes windows 7 to crash.&nbsp; I wasn't using the machine much over Christmas and it seemed to work ok if I turned it off, went into safe mode, shut down
 normally then loaded windows normally.&nbsp; At this point i didn't realise the problem was AVG.&nbsp; But due to start work again I needed to get it functioning properly so I spent some time trying fixes and looking online (on my PC) and discovered the AVG issue.&nbsp;
 It had got so bad I could do nothing even in safe mode.&nbsp; Clicking on any AVG related icon or file crashed the whole system.&nbsp; I found a fix to prevent AVG running by renaming a couple of exe files exe.bak.&nbsp; This worked and the computer was running normally
 but I needed to get AVG removed which proved impossible as I still couldn't get anything AVG related to do anything at all.</p>
<p>I installed a free trial of an uninstallation programme, RevoUninstaller.&nbsp; It took most of the day but eventually this removed everything.&nbsp; One of the steps is to run the chosen programme's uninstaller where it paused for hours and the next step of showing
 any remaining files showed thousands of registry files and hundreds of other files so I assume the uninstaller didn't run at all and revo removed everything.</p>
<p>The next day the computer ran smoothly.&nbsp; I had avast installed and everything was fine with one exception - the toshiba product update pre-installed programme.&nbsp; I wasn't really worried about that.</p>
<p>The day after BSOD.&nbsp; Tried startup repair, got 20 minutes of a black screen with a flashing cursor, eventually a big white mouse pointer and nothing else.&nbsp; Tried safe mode, when it runs through the list of files it just stopped for a while and got no further.&nbsp;
 Dug out my windows 7 repair disk, put that in, boot from it, got the same problem as with startup repair, big pointer on an empty black screen.</p>
<p>So what do I do next?&nbsp; I have the windows XP restore disk that came with the laptop.&nbsp; Do I try booting from that?&nbsp; If I HAVE to I could do yet another factory restore but I do have a few files on there and I am getting pretty p'd off with having to endlessly
 mess around with this machine.</p>
<p>While I'm on it, does anyone know of any issues with avast?&nbsp; Am I going to be forced to use microsoft antivirus because nothing else works with win 7?</p>
<p>A great many thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like the computer has hardware issues and you should contact Toshiba Support since it is<br />
still under warranty. Restoring it back to factory specs probably will be required. Keep in mind<br />
that the more you do the more they can claim it is something you did so starting at factory<br />
fresh is a wise move.<br />
<br />
Keep Avast or use MSE as both are excellent and neither is the cause of your issues. (Use one or<br />
the other, not both.)<br />
<br />
Check with Toshiba Support, their on-line drivers (to update or re-install), and their forums.<br />

            <p>Hello Prathamesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error codes you're receiving might be caused by corrupted DLL files in the system.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Re-register the ISDONE.dll file and then try to install again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Start </strong>button, and then select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>regsvr32 Isdone.dll</strong>, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Run the <strong>System File Checker</strong> (SFC) scan to repair missing or corrupted system files.</p>

            <p>Hello, <br />
<br />
<br />
The methods that were provided by Patricia are reliable. In this case that the error message still shows up, please consider to check for available updates on Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Here are a few checklists:<br />
<br />
1. Graphic card driver updates.</p>
<p>2. System requirements of the game being installed.</p>
<p>3. Third party related apps that are necessary for the game to launch.</p>
<p>4. Check the required APIs (Application program Interfaces) like DirectX and Visual Studio version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue could be cause by some update components that were not able to download correctly due to broken files or interference with the update process. This could be one of the possible reasons why the Update Assistant keeps on downloading without realizing
 that update can't push through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to get this issue fixed, we suggest that you uninstall any 3rd party anti-virus software as it usually blocks files and components from the update. We suggest that you use Windows Defender instead (or temporarily if you prefer the 3rd party anti-virus
 software). Then follow the steps provided on this article to have a fresh update process:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>If these articles didn't help, or if the issue persists, it is best to do a clean installation, but make sure to create a back up for your files. Here's a thread where you can see the helpful tips and steps:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 wierd pink tint to everything. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 wierd pink tint to everything.</h2>
                    Ok, so recently WIndows 10 has been making red appear pink. I have tried calibrating my display settings but to no avail. I have reinstalled drivers. I have done everything I can find on the question. Although white still appears white things that are
 red appear to be pink. Also green is a darker green then it should be. If you have any tips on helping calibrate the display I would be grateful. Also I have 2 monitors. The problem is on both of them and I already know that it is windows 10 and not my monitors.
 Because when it loads up it looks normal but once I log in it looks terrible. All my cables are also firmly in place so it is not that either.&nbsp;

            1. Can you do following -
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + CTRL + C to turn off the grayscale filter 
<br />OR 
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Color &amp; hight contrast &gt; Set Apply color filter to OFF 
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't solve the problem, Windows key+I &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes &gt; try chnaging Themes

<h2>            Call of Duty&#58; Modern Warfare &#40;Need I say more&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, to be quite frank, I don't really from which angle to attack this subject from. I mean, there is so much wrong right now about an award-winning game, it's actually somewhat beyond my belief that developers of the game and Xbox can sit back and watch
 the game be torn apart?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since I purchased COD4, day in, day out, I have been faced with hacked lobbies. I would go as far enough to say that near enough 19 our of the 20 lobbies I am put in each day are hacked someway or another. I have people flying above and below me, spamming
 noobtubes, crashing the game, accessing god modes, infinite bullets and even managing to hack the points system for the whole lobby so that everyone receives like 4000 points for a single kill?! These lobbies that hack such things may portray images to XBL
 and other sources that innocent players, like myself, who just want to play a fair game, are hacking and might well be possibly banned for it! I mean, c'mon, seriously? It's outrageous. What kind of award-winning game is this? Did it win best comedy-do-whatever
 you-want game of the year award? Because right now that's what it looks like to me and several other thousand players...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I payed £20 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and right now, that's not what I'm playing. I think you'd agree that in the game description before you buy the game it doesn't say 'G£T ur frEEZ HAKED lobb13Z 4 1200 MS just MeSSsAGE ME' or say anything about
 a flying perk? Although, if it did, I truly am sorry, I must of completely missed it.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I heard a possible 'rumor' floating about which suggested a patch was going to be released to stop these hackers from destroying COD4 and quite possibly put an end to hackers full stop. Right about now, I'd go with the fact to say it was just a rumor, because
 since it was announced by a developer about 1-2 months ago, nothing has changed. People might say I'm flaming, I disagree, I'm making what is a very much needed thread to stress the anger of certain innocent individuals within the COD4 community who wish to
 play the game as it was created. I understand that XBL keep stressing that they can't do anything about it? Are you joking? You are Microsoft, possibly one of the biggest and more famous technologically advanced gaming industries in the world today, the game
 has been created and release for Xbox and is being played on a console on which Xbox created. I don't want to be hearing that Xbox can't do anything about it. I understand that a game must go through verification and testing by Microsoft before it can be released
 on Xbox, so please explain why you have allowed what is happening now on COD4 to happen? Did you verify hackers and hacked lobbies? I think not...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would just like to see a bit more help and support from Xbox to push developers from COD4 to fix the game, especially if they 'apparently' can't do anything about it. The community payed for a console and game which was registered to Xbox and Microsoft,
 we expect your to take charge and fix the bloody game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response from an XBL representative would be appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

OP these games will never be fixed, MW MW2 ans WaW have been broken for years and still nothing has been done.<br />

I ceased playing all three of these games a long time ago because of these problems and many others have done the same. But will that stop the majority from rushing out on day 1 to buy MW3?, sadly I doubt it.</em></p>

<p>But why? Please tell me why? This is not a sandbox for little kids to mess around in, this is a situation involving corporations vastly greater than I am as an individual although I pay to play, I bought the game and I have the console which ultimately should
 give me some right in at least to think i can play a game legitimately. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If developers had any sense, they would fix a problem with previous releases in the COD series before even thinking to announce a new version. This clearly shows without doubt that no developers care for the community and to be quite honest, neither do Xbox.
 Xbox sould stamp down on developers, stamp down on hackers and stamp down on the stuff currently occurring in COD4. They could force the game offline, off store shelves and off GoD until it is fixed, do you not agree this is a viable method for everyone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's sad big game industries and developers don't truly care for the community....</p>

<p><em>I agree about the developers, its a sad state of affairs, and the reason I will not be buying their next release in the series. I will rent it because I want to see how the story goes but as far as giving them my hard earned money they can forget it.<br />
<br />
As far as MS goes they do stamp down on modders and cheats, if you have a minute go look in the
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">suspension forum</a> as its jam packed with people who have been permanently banned from LIVE for using infections and mods.
<br />
More and more every single day but it does not matter how many MS ban because until these games are patched by the companies responsible for them the problem will never go away.<br />
<br />
But what can MS do to make the developers fix their games, in my eyes the only thing they could do is remove the games from the service until the developers do something. I personally would&nbsp;support this idea, but I would be in te minority.<br />
There would be an outcry from all the people playing the games directed against MS if they removed them, even though they would be doing it to try and force the developers hands to fix them.
<br />
<br />
What people need to do is contact treyarch/IW and Activision and make a serious amount of noise. Or boycott MW3 and refuse to rush out and spend another £45 on a game that could end up as broken as its predecessors.<br />
<br />
There have been hundreds of posts in the forums, more likely thousands actually. All from people who have head their stats reset or are just sick to death of all the modding in CoD titles. I imagine a lot of them have contacted the respective developers for
 the games and Activision but how have these 3 companies responded?.<br />
Well they have not, and there is the problem.</em></p>

<p><span><span>I see that most of the things on your network are intact. To begin with, I suggest that you check if you are able to connect to the Homegroup in
 ‘Safe Mode with Networking’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can follow the below steps to boot the computer to ‘Safe Mode with Networking’:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you are able to open the Internet Explorer icon in ‘Safe Mode with Networking’:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps to boot the computer to ‘Safe Mode’:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Restart
 your computer if it is powered on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Tap
 the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Once
 you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Use
 the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select<strong>Safe
 Mode with Networking</strong> and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Logon
 to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>

    <title>Night light not affecting cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captaintologist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Night light not affecting cursor</h2>
                    Recently I discovered the night light setting, and I thought I'd try it out. It seems to work perfectly except for one problem: the cursor is unaffected. I only use the computer at night when I'm working or gaming, so it doesn't really show, but the few
 times it does it's a complete eyesore compared to the rest of the colors. It looks like a really light cyan, but really bright. Is this because it's a new feature, or is there something I'm missing?

<br />So  you can write it off as new feature shortcoming or lack of understanding by the analyst.  But then again, the tool (f.lux) MS stole the idea from doesn't do it either.
