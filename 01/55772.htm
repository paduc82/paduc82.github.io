                    A pro installed drivers for me but now I cannot get the PC to "sleep"; I can only shut it down or restart it. The sleep and hibernate wording when I hit the Shut Down key from Start are not operating; you can see them&nbsp; (faded) but now activate them. Help??

<h2>            Sync center stuck on pending</h2>
                    Our firm computers operate on Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1. Some members take their laptops to see clients and in the past have been able to sync their offline files once they come back to the office. We are having trouble doing this procedure
 now as it gets stuck on sync pending and doesn't work at all. Is there any way to fix this issue? I have checked our sharing permissions, so that is not the issue but if there's any other suggestions, please post and we will try.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>So, System Restore did not remove any of these folders or files - I'm surprised (unless you didn't notice them when they happened and thus didn't go back far enough).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are these numbered folders in the drive's root directory or some other folder (if elsewhere, what is the entire path to the folder)?&nbsp; Right click on the folders and click
 on properties and tell me the create date - is it recent and is it after the restore point you used?&nbsp; If before the restore point (and within reason), try another System Restore to before this create date to see if that works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If System Restore doesn't work, then I&nbsp;would suggest the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>See if you can download/run the MSRT manually:</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If none of them pick up anything (especially anything concerning these folders and files), then create a system restore point and
 backup the registry.&nbsp; Then go ahead and rename the folders to the same name with the addition of -old at the end and reboot.&nbsp; Are they gone (except for the old renamed folders - I mean did they recreate themselves)?&nbsp; Did you get any error messages?&nbsp; Is everything
 working (especially your security software)?&nbsp; If so, then the problem is almost resolved.&nbsp; Now you can go in and delete the renamed entries and reboot.&nbsp; If you have any troubles at all (including any messages) or anything doesn't work any longer or you can't
 boot or can't get online, or have any problems whatsoever, then first try to rename the folders back to what they were and reboot.&nbsp; This should fix the problem.&nbsp; If you had reached the deletion stage, try to restore them from the Recycle bins (you may need
 to do this on both drives if you have separate bins) and reboot to see if things return to normal.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, do a system restore to the point before you deleted the items and that should put you back where you were and you'll just have to live
 with the folders since deleting them causes problems.&nbsp; Make sure you have a disk to boot to to do the system restore if that becomes necessary.&nbsp;Y<span>ou can make a bootable Recovery Disk using

<blockquote>John Inzer,<br />
<br />
Excellent threads, thank you.<br />
<br />
One more quick question as everything you produced worked and I was able to find the primary issue : it has to be the audio CD selection in the burn selection tab in the primary WMP window. not under tools/ options/ burn .
<br />
<br />
Is there ANY workaround the limitation of tracks to the file burnlist when choosing AudioCD type.<br />
3 tracks short of getting all burned to 1 cd. I've tried running it through a bit converter all the way down to 96kbps and it still produces the need to add disc 2 for 3 tracks........ IS this all because of the 44bytes fixed read structure of .cda??&nbsp;</blockquote>
=====================================<br />
There's a limit to the number of files you can burn on an <br />
Audio (Music) CD because&nbsp;they&nbsp;are rendered by duration <br />
and not file size. If you look at the numbers on the CD it<br />
will show Minutes and MBs. <br />
<br />
If you wanted to trim your songs slightly...you may get <br />
the other 3 on there. Also...if you use CDBurnerXP to <br />
create a 'gapless' cd you may gain some space.<br />
<br />
This is why MP3 CDs (which are Data CDs that are based <br />
on file size) are neat because you can burn so many more <br />
files on them but if your CD Player is not MP3 compatible <br />
you have no choice.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<p>Thanks. I'm ready to format my hard drive and install the older operating system, then download the link for Windows 7 Professional, then install Windows 7 Starter.&nbsp; Should I deactivate Windows 7 before I format my HD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I strongly suggest you download Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit which I&nbsp;specifically provided in the link in my first reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of those Digital River .ISOs and Links such as Windows 7 Professional won't work with the instructions I provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, providing a 64 bit version of Windows 7 like JW did does not make any sense, since there is no 64 bit version of Windows 7 Starter.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There no need to deactivate anything since you will be using your COA sticker for Windows 7 Starter to reactivate the license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you can't find a disc, you can download a copy from the following link and use that to create the all in one disc:</strong></p>
<p>• <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59463.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Windows 7 Ultimate (x86)* – X17-59463</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above .ISO file guarantees you will get Windows 7 Starter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activating your Windows 7 Starter installation:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - WiFi - Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randyco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - WiFi - Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time</h2>
                    <p>I work&nbsp;with a small museum.</p>
<p>We have four laptop computers and several other devices that use our WiFi and have been working fine for over a year.</p>
<p>The computers are running Windows 10.</p>
<p>Again things have been working fine for over a year.</p>
<p>Suddenly two of the laptops cannot connect to the WiFi.&nbsp; I take the laptops home and they connect to my home WiFi just fine.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;the museum WiFi is fine because other computers are still connecting.</p>
<p>I have tried all the standard uninstalled the drivers, look for updated drivers, uninstall the Wireless device.</p>
<p>I ran [<span>netsh wlan show wlanreport] and found this message: "</span>Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time" has happened 128 times.</p>
<p>Does ANYONE have any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks, Randy</p>

            <p>That is the frustrating part, there has been NO hardware or software changes to either laptop having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best guess is a Windows 10 update was applied since I have auto updates turned on.</p>
<p>I did note the build is 10586.164 on the first laptop.&nbsp; Did not manage to check the builds on the other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two laptops that stopped working are:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Lenovo Model 20182</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dell Inspiron 15</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;setup a new printer which was able to connect to the WiFi on the first try, and my personal laptop and cell phone both connected as usual, which again tells me it is NOT a router issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article you reference does not reference Windows 10.&nbsp; Is the process still relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be at the museum next Saturday.&nbsp; So I will try this process Saturday on one of the laptops.</p>
<p>

<p>It is very frustrating because these two&nbsp;laptops used this WiFi for a year and then suddenly all I get is "cannot connect".</p>
<p>Other computers/devices still access the WiFi fine.</p>
<p>I have attached a new printer and a cell phone to the WiFi in the last week and they had no problems.&nbsp; So I really do NOT think it is the router.</p>
<p>It is almost like the latest Windows 10 update did some change to the WiFi security.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

</p><blockquote>Yes but it shpuld be in enforcement page
</blockquote>
<p>Console suspensions are handled differently. The Enforcement page is for accounts. Repeated violations or other breaches of the Xbox Live Code of Conduct and/or Microsoft Services Agreement will result in console bans. The temporary console ban is a relatively
 new feature; prior to Xbox One, console bans were permanent and not subject to appeal.</p>

<p>Restart is a little slow and don't panic when you see the initialization of the watchdog this time around it should jump to next steps. It is a little slower on the first boot.</p>

            <p>My problem is that the new update will not dowload at all.</p>
<p>I have had to revert to previous version by doing a "Hard Reboot"</p>
<p>This is done by switching off the computer, removing the power cord and then the battery.</p>
<p>Leave for at least 30 seconds, reinsert the battery and restart the computer. </p>
<p>This may work for you.</p>

            Same issue with us! &nbsp;After update, got this exact same error and it just freezes after the "finished" line. &nbsp;Can't get the computer to start and f8 does not work. &nbsp;Have had the computer start a few times randomly and work ok, but 90% get this same issue.
 &nbsp;Very annoying that I can't find a solution or answer. &nbsp;Basically made my laptop a paperweight until Windows fixes this problem. &nbsp;Does everyone having this problem have AVG???

                    A few days ago my computer's battery died and then when i went to turn it on after charging it, I got the boot up screen however this boot up screen took about around 8 hours to boot up and even then when it got to the login screen, it took forever for
 me to type anything and when I did i wouldn't even make it to the desktop without shutting itself off. I then decided to search the internet for answers. These answers were mainly things that are impossible in the computers state due to me not even being able
 to do barely anything on the login screen. but if i were to force shut down restart a few times it would boot up automatic repair, which worked somewhat normally. after about 10 minutes of doing this it booted up the advanced options (like troubleshoot and
 system restore) i here attempted to boot into safe mode, which did not work as it now showed attempting repairs which i let run for about a day or a little more than a day. then I tried every other option on that menu restore syste

            Ok. So I put the windows 10 iso on my usb which worked correctly, then i went into the BIOS settings to make sure that it would read the usb first, then i went to repair computer which took me to troubleshoot, then advanced options. I didn't see automatic
 repair (the only things i see in Advanced options are: System restore, System image recovery, Startup repair, Command prompt, UEFI Firmware settings, and Go back to previous build) but i saw startup repair. which brought me to an error code which says. Startup
 Repair couldn't &nbsp;repair your PC. Log file: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong but hopefully this can be fixed. Thank you for your help.

<strong>There is a problem with the page you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed. When the Web server (while acting as a gateway or proxy) contacted the upstream content server, it received an invalid response from the content server.</strong>

<h2>            Multiple problems with computer - &#34;.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error&#34; - SFC &#47;scannow does not work - Windows modular installer, error 126</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem. Well not just one but many.</p>
<p>Briefly listed here are the problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>".dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error"</li><li>SFC /scannow does not work</li><li>Windows modular installer, error 126&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>In more detail...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do you think this happened?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure but i think it happened when my computer blue screened. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>More detail with the problems/errors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>So this isn't just one .dll that pops up every time i use a problem but several which i'm assuming the .dll is related to the program.I want to note that to fix this error, most suggestions on the internet recommend to use sfc /scannow which does not work
 for me.</li><li>Continuing to this point, sfc /scannow tells me that windows resource protection could not start the repair service.
<ul>
<li>I have tried multiple solutions including:
<ul>
<li>Going to services.msc and starting the service manually. Reference to point 3.</li><li>Changing the setting to manual</li><li>Going to cmd to use net start wuauserv, etc</li><li>Run CMD with admin</li><li>Run CMD with syswow64\cmd.exe and system32\cmd.exe with admin</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>As you may notice, one error leads to another. Going to modular installer and starting it popped an error named "error 126: the specified module cannot be found".&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>I have tried this solution
<ul>
<li>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959077</li><li>It did not work as the versions were completely fine.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>An additional detail is i have tried chkdsk c: /r to repair bad sectors and ran cCleaner to clean and malware bytes to check for viruses</li></ol>
<p>I just want to also note that if possible, i wish not to factory reset or system restore if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Naman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the exact error message, here is an example. It happens with multiple executable files.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24104557-6b09-4fbe-8fee-2cc76040ed31" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice SFC_os.dll is the most common one but it depends on the program i generally use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention, i attempted to install the readiness tool previously but encountered an error. There was a lot of problems so i forgot about it completely.</p>
<p>Here is the error in regards to installing this program.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4cc3a83-7dfe-4b1b-8d78-74e595627006" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing back to us and updating us on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could occur if the Windows 7 CD/DVD is corrupt or if the version of Windows 7 installed on the computer have Windows 7 Service Pack 1 installed. If
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/whats-included-in-windows-7-service-pack-1-sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Service Pack 1</a></strong> is installed on the computer then you will not be able to perform In-Place upgrade using a CD which does not have
 Windows 7 Service Pack 1 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the issue, I would request you to boot to the desktop and then uninstall Windows 7 Service Pack 1.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Note:</em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you backup all important data before performing In-Place upgrade. Also make sure you install all the latest updates including Windows 7 Service Pack 1 after you are done with In-Place upgrade.</p>

<p>I tried looking at the first method but it said "No updates are installed on this computer". I don't want to risk doing the second method without confirming.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid it's a blank CD. Last year, my father took it to the repair shop and they gave us a blank cd of windows 7 with a key written on it. Honestly, I assumed it was legitimate but i am not sure.</p>

<h2>            Why does my laptop go to sleep randomly, until I reboot&#63;  I&#39;ve tried everything...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some assistance here as I've troubleshot this with a Microsoft tech via chat in the past.&nbsp; When I was going through it with the person in MS chat, they basically had me turn everything to NEVER go to sleep, shut down, etc... on the power controls
 and said my problem was fixed, but that is not true, and the person just ended the chat with me.&nbsp; I have windows 10 running on an ASUS Rog gaming laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing, I have my laptop power controls all set to never sleep, never shut down, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;However, at random times, it will go to sleep on me, after a minute, after two minutes, after 5 minutes of inactivity, it really varies.&nbsp; It will do this
 until I restart my laptop.&nbsp; Then it seems to go away for a while, but like I said, every day or other day or couple days it will go back into this random sleep mode until I restart my laptop.&nbsp; At first I thought it was connected to some updates, but when I
 check updates, I have all the latest updates, so its not that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather not spend a bunch of time again with MS Chat only to have them end the chat with me saying my problem is fixed when it really is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas or could help me please?&nbsp; Its extremely frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            To startwith, let's try these 3 troubleshooting steps first
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Right click on battery icon in system tray &gt; Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Right click on battery icon in system tray &gt; Power options &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>Ok, so as usual, same thing is happening.&nbsp; I went through all the steps, changed the power settings, have rebooted as well, and today it's going to sleep randomly from seemingly a minute of inactivity to a few minutes, it is very random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only stops if I reboot my computer.&nbsp; Please help</p>

            Same thing happens to me. To add some insight, I believe this did start after the last windows update. A restart seems to fix the issue abruptly, but no settings changes or troubleshooting does anything.

<p><span>Hi, I have a Dell laptop running Win XP Pro SP3, and I have a problem with my 2 external USB attached hard disks. They are both giving error “this device is disabled (code 22)”. Clicking on “enable device” in Device Manager, Properties
 gives message “Windows was not able to enable this device”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They were both working fine earlier today, and until today I hadn’t had any problems with them. I still use dialup internet, and when I tried to connect to my ISP I got some error saying the modem wasn’t ready, or was disabled, or something
 like that. I’ve occasionally had something like that before, and a reboot always fixed it. However the PC froze during shutdown, and eventually I had to hold down the power button to shut it off – that has also occasionally happened in the past. When I rebooted
 the modem worked fine, but I then had the problem with the USB disks (the internal hard disk is fine). I have used the modem and the USB disks together in the past.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rebooting again didn’t fix it. Booting into safe mode didn’t fix it. I am able to use a USB stick, so the USB ports themselves appear to be O.K.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then booted the PC with my BartPE boot CD, and I was then able to access both USB drives. I copied some files from them to the internal hard disk, and then rebooted into XP again. The copy had worked O.K., but I still can’t access the
 USB drives from XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Any ideas?</span>

<p><span>Have a look in the System and Application logs in Event Viewer for Errors and Warnings and post copies here. Don't post any from than more than
 48 hours ago. </span></p>
<p><span>You can access Event Viewer by selecting Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, and Event Viewer. When researching the meaning of the error,
 information regarding Event ID, Source and Description are important. </span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. You will see a button resembling two
 pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. This places a copy of the report into your Clipboard. Paste into the body your message. Make sure that this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

<p>It often doesn't help to look back too far being you are dealing with a changing situation. Often the best approach can be to shutdown the computer. Wait 30 seconda and start the computer. Wait 5 minutes and then look in Event Viewer. Most ongoing errors
 show in the first 5 minutes after booting. You can look back to a previous boot to see if the error in the latest boot was there before which confirms whether you have an ongoing problem or a temporary blip!</p>
<p>When you disconnect your USB drives are you using Safely Remove?</p>
<p>It may also help to see what running the Dell Diagnostic tool reveals:</p>

<p><span>The TrueVector Internet Monitor service failed to start due to the following error:</span></p>
<p><span>The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know what the “Truevector internet monitor” service is, but perhaps it is appearing because I use dialup, and hence don’t have an internet connection while the PC is booting up?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The timeout errors for ShellHWDetection etc have appeared 2 or 3 times since 14/10, which is as far back as the system log goes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I always use “safely remove” when disconnecting USB devices (or disconnect them after I shut down the PC).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Dell is an Inspiron 9200 laptop, 1.70 GHz processor, 2GB RAM, 100GB internal hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll run the diagnostics utility and post the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. I don’t know why the “/* Style Definitions */” etc stuff keeps appearing in my posts – perhaps because I am copying and pasting from a Word document?</span></p>

<p><span>TrueVector Internet Monitor&nbsp;comes with Zone Alarm. Is it still being used or has Zone Alarm been removed?</span></p>
<p><span>It doesn't seem like that&nbsp;this error&nbsp;is related to your disk recognition problem&nbsp;unless it is creating an excessive demand for resources. Nevertheless it needs to be resolved as the existence of other
 errors tends to muddy the water when looking for causes of problems.</span></p>
<p><span>What type of casing are these drives in? Have you checked connections&nbsp;inside the casing between the drive and casing.&nbsp;Fitting the drive in my casing leaves little space for getting the cabling inside
 the case leaving the possibility of a connection being&nbsp;broken.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check&nbsp;the cable connections between the casing and the USB port on the computer. Try another USB port if you have one. If you are using a USB hub try connecting directly into a USB port on the computer.
 Try another USB cable if you have one.</span></p>
<p><span>Where are you getting the report about Style Definitions from?</span></p>

<p><span>I still use Zone Alarm. I looked at the information messages in the system log, and eventually I get “</span><span>The TrueVector Internet Monitor service was successfully sent a start control.” and<span>&nbsp;</span>“The TrueVector Internet
 Monitor service entered the running state.”. Hence I think it is O.K. The PC is slow to boot up and has been for a while, and the reason I want to use one of the USB drives is to move some stuff off the hard disk, which is nearly full and apparently can’t
 be replaced with anything bigger than about 120GB due to BIOS limitations. The other USB drive is for backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The USB drives are both Western Digital. The casing can’t be opened, i.e. they appear to be manufactured as a sealed unit. I don’t have spare USB cables, at least not ones with the type of connector used by the drives. I have tried using different
 USB ports (the PC has 4). But anyway, I’m sure that the drive hardware and the USB ports are O.K. because I can access both drives if I boot the PC using the BartPE boot CD. And it would be quite a coincidence if both drives failed at exactly the same time.
 Hence I’m convinced the problem isn’t hardware related.</span></p>

<p><span>I would be interested in seeing a Disk Defragmenter report. Open Disk Defragmenter and click on Analyse. Select View Report and click on Save As
 and Save. Now find VolumeC.txt in your My Documents Folder. Open the file, and place the cursor anywhere in the file, select Edit, Select All to highlight all text and copy and paste into the body of your message. Do this before running Disk Defragmenter as
 it is more informative.</span></p>
<p><span>Try Ctrl+Alt+Delete to select Task Manager and click the Performance Tab. Under Commit Charge what is the Total, the Limit and the Peak?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You could test both USB drives by plugging them into another computer.</span></p>

<p><span>You can create more free space in C by carrying any of the measures suggested below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation to System Restore is 12% on your C partition which is over generous. I would reduce it to 700 mb. Right click your My Computer icon on the
 Desktop and select System Restore. Place the cursor on your C drive select Settings but this time find the slider and drag it to the left until it reads 700 mb and exit. When you get to the Settings screen click on Apply and OK and exit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A default setting which could be wasteful is that for temporary internet files, especially if you do not store offline copies on disk. The default allocation is 3%
 of drive. Depending on your attitude to offline copies you could reduce this to 1% or 2%. In Internet Explorer select Tools, Internet Options, General, Temporary Internet Files, Settings to make the change. At the same time look at the number of days history
 is held.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation for the Recycle Bin is 10 % of drive. Change to 5%, which should be sufficient. In Windows Explorer place the cursor on your Recycle Bin, right
 click and select Properties, Global and move the slider from 10% to 5%. However, try to avoid letting it get too full as if it is full and you delete a file by mistake it will bypass the Recycle Bin and be gone for ever.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your drive is formatted as NTFS another potential gain arises with your operating system on your C drive. In the Windows Directory of your C partition you will
 have some Uninstall folders in your Windows folder typically: $NtServicePackUninstall$ and $NtUninstallKB282010$ etc. These files may be compressed or not compressed. If compressed the text of the folder name appears in blue characters. If these files are
 not compressed you can compress them. Right click on each folder and select Properties, General, Advanced and check the box before Compress contents to save Disk Space. On the General Tab you can see the amount gained by deducting the size on disk from the
 size. Folder compression is only an option on a NTFS formatted drive / partition.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected
 options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the System restore option is most appropriate when your system is running slow and you need to increase free disk space on your C partition.
 If you have errors which might be resolved using System Restore to put your system settings back to before the error first occurred do not use this option.</span></p>
<p><span>If more than one person uses the computer and they have their own user Log on you need to run Disk CleanUp in each user profile to remove all unwanted
 files.</span></p>
<p><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner but note that cCleaner will not handle System Restore points. Removing older restore points can
 be important if you have limited free disk space. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors.</span></p>

<h2>            Touch Screen partially working</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS transformer 10.1 inch laptop with Windows 8.</p>

</p><p>The touchscreen just stopped working as a mouse. I can use it to scroll up, down, left, and right, but it no longer works as a "mouse click". The little circle appears that says it registers the touch, but it doesn't affect the content on the screen.</p>

            Hi,<br />
First of all thanks for the concern .<br />
<br />
As per mentioned by you above, I have tried to&nbsp;<span><span>Turn off Core isolation memory integrity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Expected Path</strong> by you:</span></span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity<br />
</span><span><span><strong>Actual Path</strong> that got:</span></span><em>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard<br />
<br />
</em>There is no such sub-folder present under DeviceGuard so that i can go further as per instruction.<br />
<br />
Help me to understand what steps i must follow further, and i have one more question how come all of a sudden it is started happening after the Update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, waiting for your valuable reply .<em><br />
<br />
</em>Regards<em>,<br />
Pritam</em>

<h2>            Recovering e-mail &#40;Vista Mail&#41; from dead PC...</h2>
                    My mother's PC has failed twice... The first time, it was a memory failure that resulted in me installing some new memory and doing a fresh install of Vista Home Premium. Before fixing the computer, I was able to connect to her HDD via our network, and
 save all the mail in her inbox in Windows Mail. After fixing the PC completely, I created a new folder under her Inbox called "Old Mail", and copied all of her e-mails into that folder. Her new e-mails, of course, showed up in the regular Inbox. Now, this
 second failure, occurred about two weeks ago and was caused by the on-board graphics chip going out. She had no video card, and I couldn't install any old regular video card in her PC to solve the problem because she had a slim desktop that requires a "half-height"
 card. So, we decided that it was time to get her a better PC. As it turns out, the one she picked out had two front-loading, removable SATA HDD slots. Perfect! After the initial setup, re-installing all of her software, and countless Windows updates, I shut
 the PC down and put the HDD from her dead PC into the new one using one of the SATA slots. Windows recognized it fine, as a second HDD, and I was able to access it with no problems. I figured I'd be able to just go into her mail folder, and like before, get
 all the e-mails that she received after the FIRST failure, but before the SECOND failure and again, copy them into a new folder like I had done the first time.
<br />
<br />
The e-mails are not there! If I attempt to load Windows Mail off of her old HDD, it just loads the new one. I searched the mail folder under her documents folder, and found the mail folder, but it only included the e-mails I had recovered from the first failure.
 No new mails after the first failure but before the second one were there. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions? This new PC is running Vista Home Premium 64-bit. The dead PC was 32-bit.

            This is the easy part, Drag the discrete .EML email files into the Windows Mail folder(s) of your choice, Windows Mail can directly accept them (E.G. in Windows Explorer, do a "Select All" in the Inbox file folder on the old HD, drag the .EML files to
 Windows Mail's Inbox and drop them).&nbsp; Dates, timestamps, etc., are all preserved.<br />

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death &#40;When Gaming&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I own an Asus Zenbook UX501VW notebook<br />
NVIDA 960M<br />
16 GB, intel i7-6700 HQ @ 2.6 GHz<br />
<br />
I always receive a blue screen of death when I play games that requires higher-end performances. This had never been an issue until recently. I've tried updating my NVIDIA driver to the latest, reverting to the old one, and updating again to the latest; still
 no dice. The same can be said about my Windows driver as well.<br />
<br />
Errors vary in messages but they are usually, "<strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/hardware/ff560129(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</a>"</strong><br />
<br />
Your help is sincerely appreciated.<br />

    <title>Remote Desktop Connection Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob hakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection Problem</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Though it has always worked OK, for over a year, I get the following error, whenever I attempt to connect to any other computer: "Remote Desktop Connection has encountered a problem and needs to close."&nbsp; It then only gives me the option of sending a report
 to Microsoft or not, and to cliek "OK" to close.&nbsp; In the technical details of the message to Microsoft, the "Code:" is "0xc0000005".&nbsp; The error signature is: "AppName: mstsc.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; AppVer: 6.0.6001.18000&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ModName:&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;mstscax.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ModVer: 6.0.6001.18000&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Offset: 0015b2f5" <br />
<br />
This behavior started after I had resolved a boot-up problem (various processes [including occasionally, Windows Explorer] would report an initialization failure, and that module would not be available to use until after another reboot, and the specific one
 or two modules/processes would vary from reboot to reboot), which I finally resolved by using the boot menu to "boot using last known good configuration".&nbsp; After doing that "last known good" reboot, the system settled down and there were no more module initialization
 errors.&nbsp; However, I then noticed the Remote Desktop problem that I described above.<br />
<br />
I have used the "netdiag" utility (netdiag /test:winsock /v) and the TCP/IP and winsock configurations look OK.&nbsp; I have no trouble connecting to websites or FTP sites, and I also have no problem connecting to the same group of remote computers, at various IP
 Addresses, by using Real VNC.&nbsp; However I do prefer the functionality of MS Remote Desktop.<br />
<br />
Here's my system (no recent changes):<br />
&nbsp; Compaq EVO W4000 Workstation, P4 2.4GHz, 2 GB PC2100 DDR RAM; NVIDIA Quadro NVS (dual head); Intel PRO/100&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; VM Network Adapter;<br />
&nbsp; Windows XP Pro SP3; WatchGuard Mobile VPN Lite Client (with Deterministic Network Enhancer &amp; SafeNet Virtual Net&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; Adapter); Net2Printer RDP Client software <br />
<br />
I've uninstalled and re-installed the WatchGuard and Net2Printer software, with reboot and testing between uninstalls and re-installs, without any effect on the problem.&nbsp; I've also copied the files, mstsc.exe and mstscax.dll, from a known good WinXP SP3 machine
 into the problem system without any effect on the problem.<br />
<br />
Please advise.&nbsp; I'm stumped!&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />

<h2>            One Drive Tags &#40;names, places, events etc.&#41; don&#39;t recognized by Photos app in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Windows 10 PC (latest update/ not insider) and I sync OneDrive photos folder to Photos App in my computer. Through OneDrive website I have tagged all my photos (place tags, people/name tags, events, colors etc.) and I can search those tags in
 the OneDrive website to view my selected photos. Everything there works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT the same doesn't apply in the Photos App in my computer. I can see all my online content categorized in albums and collections, but I can't search for the same tags so nothing comes as a result when I type a name of a person.</p>
<p>Although, when I open the properties (in windows explorer), I can see the right tags there.</p>
<p><em>*[Note here that my online content is always available locally on my PC when I'm offline too]</em></p>
<p>I realize that Photos App doesn't recognize/read those tags.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Is there a way to have Photos App to read those tags so I can properly search for my photos locally without using OneDrive website?</strong></li><li><strong>Is it a feature that isn't implemented yet in the application?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
