<p><span><span>Hi there,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>be sure to try this first:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;please try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a> </span></span></p>
<p>Also try to see what happens if you try to add someone via Xbox.com or Xbox App.</p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't solve it be sure to check how many friend you already have, on the Xbox One 1000 is the maximum.</span></span></p>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

<h2>            Computer stuck at Starting windows.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,I'm having problems with my PC and I was hoping that someone who knows more than me can help.</p>
<p>Here's my problem: I was playing some games when my PC froze (this happens often but I usually just have to shutdown my PC and restart it) so I restarted it. But, when it got to &nbsp;the starting windows screen, it got stuck, I didn't log on, and after a minute,
 it just reset with the option to start in safe mode again. I selected start in safe mode,and while it was loading, it got stuck too,and after a minute it just reset again. I would be really happy if someone could give me an answer to my problem.</p>
<p>(The windows I'</p>
<p>m using is Windows 7)</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Sorry for not replying. Anyway, to download the disc from the link you proivided i need key,but I cant find my original disc nor box,which means I dont have the key. I tried to repair with a system repair disc,but,the only other pc that i have access to
 bas windows 7 64 bit. I made a system repair disc from there and used it but &nbsp;I didnt get the option to boot from disc and I couldnt repair it. My only other &nbsp;option is to buy or pirate a disc. Before I buy the disc, I need to know which one I have to buy.
 I need to buy &nbsp;Windows 7 ultimate edition 32 bit,right? Since thats the version of my pc.</p>

 blue windows 7 screen and nothing happened. I tried booting from the instalation disc where I had to select my keyboard and language. I had the option to instal now and repair your computer. I chose repair. Again a blank screen. I pressed enter and there was
 a wheel on my mouse like it was loading something,if I pressed space it would say starting startup.What do I do?

<p>Hi Marin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you've already performed a system repair and you're still experiencing the same issue, there's a possibility that the issue you're experiencing is hardware related. It is best if you will be contacting your device manufacturer so they can give you
 additional troubleshooting steps.</p>

<h2>            Event Viewer EventID&#58;1014,DNS Client,</h2>
                    
<p>I had wondered about this error and troubleshot this for some time.&nbsp; I have tried to recycle my modems power, I have tried to communicate with my ISP (Cox Cable) to see if they have a ready made solution for this error.&nbsp; Non responsive.&nbsp; I have turned off
 the DNS for awhile (to originally see if my internet surfing speed would improve) and to see the effect of it on this error.&nbsp; Doing that was worse, in that more errors of the same '<em>istap.cox.net</em>' and also '<em>us.McAfee's.com</em>' servers.</p>
<p>I have not gotten a call back from the techs at cox and will try once&nbsp;again.&nbsp; Someone suggested that there might be a problem with my cable modem.&nbsp; I want to know for sure before addressing this "expense" option.&nbsp; It seems to perform just fine, now that
 I got most of my event errors dealt with ( I have one more actually)</p>
<p>This is a new install of Windows 7 Professional x64.&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, I have had bookoo problemos with both Hardware and Software (Windows 7 x64 mostly), the thing seems to be running okay so far.&nbsp; Not perfect, not real good, just okay.&nbsp; I am a tough customer
 you might say.&nbsp; For the price and effort I have made on this machine and repairs; I just want a decent but working/powerful computer.</p>
<p>So I am hopeful that this great community of wonderful "huged brained" individuals [<em>I speak of intelligence, not a deformity</em>] could once again come through for one knucklehead who used to think himself&nbsp;a power user.&nbsp; Now, I think I can really only
 consider myself "experienced."&nbsp; Here is the Event log for this problem.</p>
<p>Log Name:&nbsp;System<br />
Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;1/12/2011 4:13:32 PM<br />

Level:&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;NETWORK SERVICE<br />
Description:<br />
Name resolution for the name isatap.ph.cox.net timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.</p>
<p>Please have a heart, I am broke and can't afford anymore hardware&nbsp;right now.&nbsp; Who can these days, for that matter?</p>

<p>Hi BarJabba,</p>
<p>Where are you seeing this error?</p>
<p>If the DNS servers are timing out, then it likely has something to do with the information being provided by the ISP.</p>
<p>The information about hte DNS servers are usually set in the modem by the ISP.</p>
<p>When Windows boots up the settings are passed to the computer from the modem.</p>
<p>I suggest contacting Cox to have a tech walk through the modem setup and settings for your computer.</p>

<h2>            CyberLink BD Solution - Error Applying Transforms.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install Cyberlink BD Solution and get the folllowing error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42590301-b263-43cb-a218-d301fe931097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42590301-b263-43cb-a218-d301fe931097" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I first tried to install the software I didn't get any errors. I managed to get past the point where this message came up, but for some reason the install froze and I was forces to restart my PC. Now when I run the installer, it asks me what language
 I want to use and then I get this. I have tried restarting the Microsoft Installer Service to no avail. I have also (as much as I didn't want to), run CCleaner *cringe* and still get the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to C:\WINDOWS folder, the Installer folder doesn't appear to be there even with hidden files shown. I am running Win 10 Build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would someone be able to help me with my issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>UnexpectedGreg.<br />

<p>It's always a good idea to quote the entire error message rather than just the code, but in this case the error is well-defined: there's a message on the server that Windows Live Mail can't or won't download.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log in to the account in webmail and start by emptying the spam and trash folders, then move all of the messages in the inbox to a user-created folder. Once the inbox is empty, do send/receive for the account in Windows Live Mail. You should see a
<em>No new email messages</em> status message at the right-hand end of the status bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now move the oldest half of the messages in the temporary folder that haven't yet been downloaded back into the inbox and again send/receive in Windows Live Mail. Rinse and repeat, halving the number of messages moved each time until you can identify any
 message that is interfering with the POP3 download.</p>

<h2>            Hulu shows &#34;Video playback not supported on this device. &#40;PB8-C0262500&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I run the Hulu app I get this error.&nbsp; The app opens, I sign in, it shows me the shows as on any other device when I try to play a video, say from NBC for example, the NBC logo will come up and the app will play video for when the show is on the schedule
 for NBC, etc.&nbsp; However, the show attempts to load and then shows this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 (all updates applied) on a Dell XPS Laptop with three monitors attached through a Dell D3100 Docking Station.&nbsp; I can run Hulu with Google Chrome as well as other browsers.&nbsp; I cannot run Hulu with Microsoft Edge or the Hulu app provided
 in the Microsoft App Store.&nbsp; Either of these two apps will give me the subject error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed prior posts on this site as well as other sites and nothing works to date.&nbsp; Is there a solution to this problem?<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Intermittent&#47;Inconsistent Issues With 2.4ghz</h2>
                    <p>Hoping to get some leads on what could be the issue.&nbsp; I have been having intermittent/inconsistent issues with my SP3's 2.4ghz WiFi radio.&nbsp; Symptoms I'll see are high ping times to the Default Gateway.&nbsp; This could be anything from constantly getting high
 ping times (perhaps 15-30ms) from just getting frequent spikes as high as over 100ms to even frequent packet loss.&nbsp; Speed Test results could have just slow download or just slow upload, sometimes both.&nbsp; This will only be when using 2.4ghz, everything is fine
 with 5ghz.&nbsp; And there are good days and bad days.&nbsp; Some days it'll seem like there is absolutely no issues.&nbsp; Other days it's terribly obvious.&nbsp; Some days it'll be obvious there's an issue, but it's mild.&nbsp; So far it seems to be something on my SP3.&nbsp; Here's
 some troubleshooting/isolating I've tried so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-When seeing the issue happening, I'll switch from 2.4ghz to 5ghz, issue goes away while on 5ghz.&nbsp; Issue comes back when switching back to 2.4ghz.</p>
<p>-Disabled programs like OneDrive, DropBox, email programs, etc.</p>
<p>-Scanned WiFi and found no other WiFi sources on the same or adjacent 2.4ghz channel.&nbsp; Even tried testing with the WAP right next to my SP3, would still see issue.</p>
<p>-Rebooted my SP3, rebooted WAP, rebooted switch.&nbsp; When seeing issue while connected to a WiFi router, rebooted WiFi router.&nbsp; Issue would persist after all these reboots.</p>
<p>-While I would see the issue, had another person with his laptop connect to the same WAP.&nbsp; Confirmed his laptop is connected to the same WAP.&nbsp; Confirmed his laptop is connected with 2.4ghz.&nbsp; Had him run ping and speed tests.&nbsp; Test results were great on his
 laptop.</p>
<p>-Tried multiple WAPs and WiFi routers, still saw issue on just my SP3, not on the other person's laptop.</p>
<p>-Rolled back WiFi adapter's drivers.&nbsp; Uninstalled/reinstalled drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My SP3 is on Windows 10 and has the Marvell AVASTAR WiFi AC Network Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>No Bluetooth devices were connected when I see the issue.&nbsp; I've even tried disabling Bluetooth when the problem last appeared and there were no changes with Bluetooth disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The channel of the WAPs and WiFi routers I've been using all have their channels set and I've scanned for any other WiFi sources that could interfere and found none.&nbsp; I've even seen the issue if I'm standing right next to the WAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSIDs on the 2.4ghz and 5ghz are the same, but I've made sure to set my WiFi NIC to use only the 2.4ghz band in the device properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, though I don't know for sure if it's been EVERY time I see the issue, but the last couple of times I can remember it happening, my SP3's fan was spinning pretty fast.&nbsp; But even when the system is still warm and the fan is spinning at high speed, the
 issue doesn't present itself when I'm on 5ghz.</p>

<p>It's a work thing.&nbsp; I work in hospitality and hotels still get quite a lot of guests using very old laptops that only have a 2.4ghz WiFi radio, so there is a need to make sure that the WiFi is operating on the 2.4ghz band.&nbsp; These hotels also prefer to have
 just one SSID visible to the guests.&nbsp; For example, instead of a guest seeing both "HotelWiFi" and "HotelWiFi-5ghz," then getting confused or asking questions about why there's two, or if one is fake, or just assuming the "-5ghz" is fake and avoiding it, etc.,
 they will see only "HotelWiFi" and connect to it according to very simple instructions at check in without confusion.&nbsp; Their devices will communicate with the WAP and pick the better of the two bands.&nbsp; When I need to test, troubleshoot, or even add-on to the
 WiFi, I need to test both 5ghz and 2.4 ghz individually.</p>

<p>My router is a Linksys WRT AC1900.&nbsp; It has both 2.4ghz and 5ghz.&nbsp; The same SSID is used for both bands.&nbsp; But I've set my NIC on my SP3 to connect to only either 2.4 or 5, so it should stick to just one radio instead of bouncing between both.</p>

<p>the link takes you to my blog where the trailer is I didn't realize I wasn't aloud to post about things if they were hosted on my blog?</p>
<p>If that is the case can you post youtube videos etc from youtube because that could be seen as advertising too... In fact any link could be seen as advertising?</p>
<p>Im confused is it against the forum rules? I have seen many people before post links to their websties or blogs</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Updates KB4481480, KB4480970, KB890830, Issues with Remote Desktop and Remote Access</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer running windows 7.</p>
<p>the computer updated Jan 9, 2019 at 3 am. updates were KB4481480, KB4480970 and KB890830.</p>
<p>this is a shared computer on our network. with at least 5 different users using the files and folders. mostly network drives. For administration we use Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I arrived to work I was informed no one could access the network shares on this computer. Remote desktop was not working either.&nbsp; I could ping the computer from my PC. Even after a reboot, and resetting passwords we still had remote connection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An authentication error has occurred.</p>
<p>The Local Security Authority cannot be contacted</p>
<p>Remote computer xxx.xxx.xx.xxx</p>
<p>this could be due to an expired password</p>
<p>Please update your password if it has expired</p>
<p>for assistance contact your administrator or technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find any solution to this issue.&nbsp; I performed a restore to a point before the updates were installed.</p>
<p>after the restore users could again connect to the remote computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a solution to this issue? anyone else have remote connection issues after installing this update on a windows 7 machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>
<p>George</p>
<p>

<p>This is what finally worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
An analysis of the issue was published on the German admin website&nbsp;<a href="https://administrator.de/contentid/397581#comment-1336425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Administrator.de</a>.
 The analysis confirms the network share issue and that it is caused by the installation of KB4480960 or KB4480970.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
The issue is triggered only if the user attempting to make the connection is an administrator on the machine that hosts the Share. If the user is "just" a user on the device that hosts the share, the connection should be fine.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
A workaround has been published to address the issue. It modifies the Windows Registry and should be run on the system that hosts the share. Note that you need to run from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li>
reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\system /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</li><li>
Reboot the PC.</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
The Registry entry defines how administrator credentials are applied for remote access. A value of 1 sets the restrictions to Audit mode.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
Removal of the updates resolve the issue as well but will remove the security patches on the target system that Microsoft released in January 2019.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
I used the reg add. after I rebooted the computer I was able to use remote desktop and connect remotely to the network shares.&nbsp; I hope this can help someone else.</p>

            We have the same issue. When we install it, we can no longer RDP to Windows 7 machines if using Secure RDP. If using unsecure RDP it is fine but our machines HAVE to be PCI Compliant. Therefore we need to make sure RDP is using FIPS 4 security and TLS
 1.2.

<p>I have the exact same issue and discovered a work around until M$ develops a fix.&nbsp; What I did is posted in "Remote Desktop Connection stopped working after Windows 7 Pro updates on Jan 9 2019"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I posted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that KB4480970 is the culprit.&nbsp; Uninstalling that KB does not fix the problem.&nbsp; Using System Restore and selecting a restore point before the update does not fix the problem.&nbsp; I also tried modifying my registry but that didn't fix the
 problem.&nbsp; These were suggested in some of the posts that I read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am reading it occurs to me that the update somehow screws up Network Level Authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the change I made to get Remote Desktop Connection to work.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System"&nbsp; (open Control Panel and click on System)</li><li>Click on "Remote Settings".&nbsp; That will open the System Properties window at the "Remote" Tab.&nbsp; Currently the selection is "Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Authentication (more secure)"</li><li>Select "Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)"</li><li>Do this on all your computers.</li><li>Reboot all the computers</li><li>RDC now works.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This is a workaround until M$ fixes that bad patch.&nbsp; Once the fix is in place I will go back and again use the more secure connection method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            It looks like Microsoft, for all practical purposes, no longer supports file or printer sharing.&nbsp; You put up a share to save backups (or whatever) - it spontaneously disconnects for no discernable reason.&nbsp; Shares are utterly unreliable..&nbsp; MS sabotages
 printer and file sharing regularly.&nbsp; Does anyone know if this is an official direction, or simply a manifestation of gross incompetence?

<h2>            burn photo cd from email attachment photos</h2>
                    When I bought this computer with Windows 8, I transferred my photos from Kodak Easy Share and installed Kodak Easy Share on my computer.&nbsp; I received a MacAfee scan that said Kodak Easy Share was quarantined with a virus.&nbsp; I just tried to download some
 emailed photos and burn them to&nbsp; a cd but they are automatically going into Easy Share into zip compressed files I can not open even though it says I am downloading them to my desktop, I can not find them.&nbsp; Do I need to uninstall EasyShare in order to use
 windows Media player to burn them to a cd?&nbsp; I can not figure out how to drag them to the cd burner to burn? How does one burn attached photos from email?&nbsp; I have not installed Microsoft Office works, is that required to burn on the cd burner?

                    I have been working on a character for VRchat in Blender and i tried moving it to Unity, but when I extract my .blend file into a .fbx file it is not Unity files as it would be on another computer it is a 3D paint file. I even tried downloading a shading
 pack online for Unity and all the .fbx files in there are also replaced as 3D paint files and I can't import them into Unity.

<h2>            Windoews 8.1 File History - missing files&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have activated File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, File History doesn't backup every folder on drive, and I don't know why. I tried few times to backup, but every time is same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, Document folder - size and number of folders</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular
<ul>
<li>Size: 6.72 GB</li><li>Contains:
<ul>
<li>25.478 Files</li><li>8.799 Folders</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>File History
<ul>
<li>Size: 4.74 GB</li><li>Contains:
<ul>
<li>8.986 Files</li><li>1.699 Folders</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Here is below one example.</p>
<p>I tried to use manually "Run now" but nothing.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nedims,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you getting any error message/code?</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any changes prior to the issue? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the issue description you are able to backup files but all of the files are not getting backed up. So, it means the service responsible for backup is running. However, for a workaround, I would suggest you to stop the service first and then
 restart it and see if it brings any difference to the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To stop the service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type <strong>
services.msc</strong> in the search field or <strong>run</strong><strong>window</strong> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>In the <strong>Services Windows </strong>search for <strong>Volume Shadow Copy
</strong>in the list, right-click on it, and then click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li><li><span>Now repeat the same for <strong>Windows Backup service</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To Start the service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type <strong>
services.msc</strong> in the search field or <strong>run</strong><strong>window</strong> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>In the <strong>Services Windows </strong>search for <strong>Volume Shadow Copy
</strong>in the list, right-click on it, and then click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li><span>Now repeat the same for <strong>Windows Backup service</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If issue persist, </span>I would request you to run chkdsk command to scan your hard disk if there is any corruption with disk or not.
<span>To check if your hard drive is causing the issue we can try running chkdsk command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Steps to run <strong>CHKDSK</strong> command.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press Windows key&nbsp;+ X.</span></li><li><span>Select Command prompt (Admin) from the list.</span></li><li><span><span><span>Press<strong> </strong>OK</span> the UAC prompt if shown. That will open an elevated command prompt. (It will show Administrator in the caption.)&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Then enter the <strong>chkdsk</strong> command<br />
<strong>chkdsk c: /f</strong> (or other drive letter if applicable).</span></li><li><span>Confirm to run on next startup and reboot.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Computer can‚Äôt run a disk check while actively using Windows, but you can schedule it to start automatically the next time your computer is turned on.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When the disk check is finished, your computer will automatically reboot. The disk check will fix any problems it encounters in your hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: </span></em></strong><em><span>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of this and nothing works.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Are you getting any error message/code?</strong></span></p>
<p>No, but I open File History folder manually to check does everything works good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</strong></span></p>
<p>Possible. I had already File History running.. but then I delete File History folder (because there was some big size file that I did't want to backup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, in File History control panel, I chose again the same disk for backup, and I was getting message like "do you wont to move some of your files from existing backup" - there wasn't any files because I was delete them all..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I notice files are still missing, I try the same procedure (deleting File History backup), and this time File History in Control Panel did't ask any question, and it was wrote "File History is saving copies of your files for the first time".</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Nedims,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and good to see that your system files and disk are free from corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that scenario I would suggest you to create a new user profile as an administrator and check the status of your issue in new user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account
 we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, for now please try to create new user account as an administrator from the link provided below. Make sure you should follow the steps mentioned under
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Create a Local account</span></strong></a><span> and get back to us with the status, we will be

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried with new user account, and copy some files in document folders. I got the same problem.<br />
<br />
Here is another image, folder with missing files - example.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/320f5591-7cd8-4092-a260-9cde5365eb08" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Missing folders on my first post, the reason was because they were blank, with no data (except more blank folders inside) - 0 kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, there is missing files like you can see on this image above.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persist in new user profile then I would suggest you to run DISM commands and see if it helps you to repair corrupted files, if available.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate your concern in playing the DVD, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue (e.g., updates, software installation)?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you getting any error messages? If yes, what is the exact error message?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you tried checking your AutoPlay default settings?</span></span></li><li>To make sure that we have not missed on anything, what troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, Windows 10 lets you easily set the <strong>AutoPlay defaults</strong> for media, devices &amp; folders via the Settings app. You may enable, disable, and set AutoPlay defaults easily via the Settings app. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> app and click on <strong>Devices</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>AutoPlay</strong> from the left side.</li><li>To enable AutoPlay, move the <strong>Use AutoPlay for all media and devices</strong> button to
<strong>On</strong>.</li><li>Next, you can choose and set your AutoPlay defaults.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Problem with NVIDIA Driver version 190.38 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozusertima  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with NVIDIA Driver version 190.38</h2>
                    I have a HP desktop with a HPw1907 flat panel monitor in very good shape. I purchased the integrated system 2 years ago with VISTA Home premium installed and a few days ago installed WINDOWS 7. The system is crashing quite frequently and attempting to
 restart with the message " NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver Version 190.38 stopped responding &amp; has successfully recovered".&nbsp; This used to happen before when I was operating under VISTA only now and then. However earlier this week when it happened several
 times, I thought that perhaps if&nbsp;I upgrade to Windows 7, this "VISTA" bug perhaps will be taken care of. However, the frequency has increased dramatically and it has crashed several times in the last one hour. Can someone please advise as to whether this is
 a Operating system problem or a fault with the HPw1907 monitor firmware....Much appreciated, Thanks, A&nbsp;

Been there and done that, installed two different drivers, the current and the previous. Happens on Vista and windows 7, unbelieveable!!!

<p>Ok guys, i fixed the problem... patched it at least...</p>
<p>I had the same problem (different model same story... as everyone else) Nvidia and Windows 7 64 (read some problems with 32 too) don't get along too well.... i tried all solutions i found over the web, nothing worked..</p>
<p><strong>Here is how i fixed it,</strong>&nbsp; i desactivated all windows visual goodies &amp; stuff...</p>
<p>Right click on my computer, go to property, then in left margin select: advanced system settings, third tab, called "Advanced" First option :&nbsp; Performance click on "settings", select "adjust for performance" that will&nbsp;uncheck everything, then you can keep
 the 3th and 4th from the end checked&nbsp;(smooth edges on screen fonts &amp;&nbsp;smooth-scroll list box, if you want the webpages text to look the way they should..&nbsp; quite essential to keep the font thing..)</p>
<p><em>my system became stable after that,</em> no more video card crash, no more
<span>Display driver NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version&nbsp;(whichever i tried)&nbsp;stopped responding and has successfully recovered</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/46f1f9d0-313a-4182-a56f-1604edf04448?outputAs=rss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi4.social.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fresources%2fimages%2ftrans.gif%3fcver%3d2.12.0041.0" /></a></p>
<p>VERY STABLE, and very simple...&nbsp; looks like win98 but functionnality are fully there... (without even mentionning how much faster this thing boots... )</p>
<p>When you see it's working well &amp; stable, add options, one at a time... (i would recommand the useful options&nbsp;you miss, not the estetic that looked good)&nbsp;i added "show thumbnails instead of icons" and it's still stable... that way, if it become unstable or
 start over again, you know wich one to uncheck...</p>
<p>it works for now, and let's hope Nvidia will release new drivers that actually works soon,...</p>
<p>hope this post will help other poor customers of Nvidia to stop those frustrating msgs... i figured i seen so many posts with that&nbsp;problems it was worth to post actually worked...</p>
<p>have a good day all...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When do you get this error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Igfxpers.exe is a process installed alongside the NVidia graphics cards and provides additional configuration options for these devices. You should try reinstalling your Graphics Driver and see if it corrects the problem.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 1: <br />
</strong>To uninstall graphics card driver, follow these steps.<br />
<br />
<font><font><font color="#000000">a. Open Device Manager by pressing <b>Windows key + X</b>, clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>System and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking <b>
Device Manager</b>.‚Äå If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b. In Device Manager, locate the graphics device you want to uninstall, and then double-click the device name.<br />
</font></font></font><font><font><font color="#000000">Click the <b>Driver</b> tab, and then click
<b>Uninstall driver </b>and follow the instructions.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
To install the driver again, follow these articles.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a></font><br />

</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 2: <br />
</strong>Non-system processes like igfxpers.exe originate from software you installed on your system. As most applications store data in your system's registry, it is likely that your registry has suffered fragmentation and accumulated harmful errors.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><br />

            heyyy<br />
<br />
I had this problem so i know what y'all should do<br />
<br />
i will tell you step by step what did i do<br />
<br />
First off if you wanna continue get a mobile and read the solution or write it down on a piece of paper (if you haven't already)<br />
<br />
ok let's get started&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1- uninstall the graphics card (intel graphics card) :))<br />
2- reboot the system<br />
3- it will appear again read the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">C:\WINDOWS\system32\??????<br />
4- read the what is written after system32 (the ??????)<br />
5- after you knew what file is after the system 32 in the message all you have to do is simply deleting it then press ok in the message box<br />
6- install the graphic drivers (intel graphic drivers) again :DDD<br />
<br />
Note : There can be problems with you when you're fixing this problem i had some boot problem that what i did :<br />
1- opened startup Repair :)) open it 3-5 times it should work but if you got an error it's the hard disk so all you have to do is opening the case then plug out the hard disk cables from the mother board (the small ones :D) then plug it back then open the start
 up repair until it brings you an error then you should repeat the last step then repeat it again until it boots up then it's done :)))) sorry guys english is not my main language :'(</span>

    <title>Samsung Printer settings not working in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung Printer settings not working in Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble with my printer settings when trying to print a PDF from Microsoft Edge. Everything works fine otherwise so I set my computer to open PDF files in Edge but when I try to print something in B&amp;W, it adds colour anyway.
</p>
<p>First of all, I don't have access to the Samsung print settings, and instead Edge has it's own setting drop down lists but when I select Monochrome instead of Colour, it sems to not make a difference and if I go back to the settings, it's back in colour
 again and printing definitely has colour. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something I will have for a driver update from Samsung for or is there another way that I can fix this?</p>

</p><p>My computer is custom so no make and model, but I can tell you about any of the parts if it's relevant. The problem seems to be only occurring with edge and I think it's because of the edge printer properties. When I print from Adobe reader or MS Word, it
 allows me to open the driver printer properties window and that works fine. My printer is a Samsung CLP-510.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to use edge, as I'm enjoying using it and I like having consolidated apps.

            <p>I have a similar issue. In Edge, when I go to "Print", and then select "More settings", that panel comes up, but when I press "OK", it thinks for a&nbsp;bit and then leaves me in the "More settings" panel, there's no way to get out except for "X" so I can't change
 any of the More Settings choices. So for example, if "More settings" says to print single sided, even if my printer is configured for duplex, Edge overrides it because "More settings" says single-sided, and I can't change it because "OK" on "More settings"
 doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is an HP Spectre 360x laptop (Win 10 64bit factory installed) with an Epson WF-3520 printer.</p>

<p>If you have input to what I can delete or move out of startup, I would appreciate it. What I usually do&nbsp;on the computer is&nbsp; internet&nbsp; surfing, emailing, and simple gaming. I do work in Wordperfect occasionally. Also, alot of photographs&nbsp;are on the computer

<div>I would leave some of the Dell stuff, but otherwise remove everything from startup.&nbsp; Too many software vendors insist their programs run at startup and add updaters as well.&nbsp; Many can be called malware.&nbsp; Go to Start | Run and type msconfig
 and there you can disable any startup items and also any non-Microsoft services.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Its not so much what is installed on your system, as it is what is running, and if all those programs want to run at startup (when none of them need to (e.g. quicktime and realplayer)), then your system is going to be slow as molasses in
 Antarctica.</div>

<p>No, the <strong>number</strong> is not an issue. <strong>What</strong> they are may be an issue.</p>
<p>Here's my standard message on this subject:</p>
<p>First, note that you should be concerned with <strong>all</strong> programs that<br />
start automatically, not just with those that go into the system tray.<br />
Not all auto-starting programs manifest themselves by an icon in the<br />
tray.</p>
<p>On each program you don't want to start automatically, check its<br />
Options to see if it has the choice not to start (make sure you<br />
actually choose the option not to run it, not just a "don't show icon"<br />
option). Many can easily and best be stopped that way. If that doesn't<br />
work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run line, and on the Startup tab,<br />
uncheck the programs you don't want to start automatically.</p>
<p>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of<br />
running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell<br />
you, you should be concerned, not with how <strong>many</strong> of these programs<br />
you run, but <strong>which</strong>. Some of them can hurt performance severely, but<br />
others have no effect on performance.</p>
<p>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do<br />
is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what<br />
the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can try<br />
internet searches and ask about specifics here.</p>
<p>Once you have that information, you can make an intelligent informed<br />
decision about what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of.</p>

            Hi nickwh, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi nickwh 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Hello, <br />
&nbsp;I managed to get the file into Onedrive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But how can I share this file with you? I dont want millions of people reading my files.
<br />
What is included in the dumpfiles, are there any personal data or could someone hack my PC through the link?
<br />
I would prefer Email . . . </p>
<p>
