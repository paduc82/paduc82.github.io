<p>Why do you want to do this?&nbsp; What problem are you having that you think this might resolve?&nbsp; Fooling around in the Registry is not to be taken lightly and should be done only by experts who fully understand what they're doing and why - if you're asking this
 question here you aren't such an expert.</p>
<p>Of course it can be deleted, but the real question is SHOULD it be deleted.&nbsp; I have no idea of the consequences to your system (they could be minor or they could be catastrophic).&nbsp; It could affect it in ways beyond just the reason you want to delete it (especially
 to your internet and other network connections given the Key) and may even cause a situation where the only recovery option is a clean install.&nbsp; If you're going to do this (and I suggest you don't unless you can provide a good explanation of why and why you
 think doing so will help and have received real expert advice {I'm not such a person} to do so in your situation), then I STRONGLY suggest you first create a System Restore point
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/</a>&nbsp;AND backup the registry
<a href="http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php</a>.&nbsp; You may also want to backup your data to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>I would not do this unless I had received instructions from a reputable source (like a Microsoft KB article or a Microsoft Support Systems Engineer).&nbsp; The risks are simply too great.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Yahoo mail not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronellington  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo mail not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 enterprise on a ThinkPad t430 and my Surface Pro and in both cases my Yahoo mail is no longer working correctly even though I haven't changed any settings and the update to 8.1 was done a few months ago without any issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am having is that when I go into my combined email&nbsp;app via the&nbsp;Metro app&nbsp;Yahoo mail (no issues with Outlook or Gmail) will not allow me to delete mails. I can click on an individual email and delete it sometimes if the email is fully open but
 if I go up one level and try to click on the check box for one or multiple emails the trash can is available once but will not actually delete after clicking on the trash can icon. The inbox refreshes as if it were deleting the emails I clicked on but they
 don't actually get deleted and then once I have done this one time there is no longer an option to use the trash can icon as it simply disappears until I log out of Yahoo mail and come back in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does NOT happen when I use my Lumia 1520 but deleting with my phone does not synch with either of my computers so the mails are still there. I can go directly to Yahoo's site and log into my email there and delete as usual but not within the Metro Mail
 app. Any ideas?</p>

            Thanks for the assistance. I tried the first two steps to no avail. I wound up removing and adding my Yahoo account back into the Mail app as suggested. This worked for about 5 minutes but after I logged off and then logged back in the same issue is back!

    <title>Windows Live Mail is not showing me all of my received emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail is not showing me all of my received emails</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are certain emails that are not showing up in my inbox on Windows Live Mail (WLM). I know they are still there because they show up on my email on my phone or when I log onto my web-based email. On WLM, the particular email that is not showing up will
 only show up when I do a "Search" in "All email, and it will show that it is in the Inbox folder, but when I conduct the search from the "Inbox" folder it does not show up. And I've noticed it is from a particular sender. I did not add this sender to junk
 or block. This makes me uncomfortable now, because I don't know what other emails are not showing up that are actually there. Anybody have any ideas how to get them to show back up? I am not willing to move mail and/or folders and rename or delete and re-create
 folders, as I have over 50 folders and subfolders. I am not willing to create a new email profile either. I've noticed those are some options others have listed on similar foums. I don't know much about POP3 and IMAP and all those other acronyms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. From what I understand, some of your emails are missing in Windows Live Mail. Since the steps provided by my colleague didn't work for you, let's try another. You may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In Windows Live Mail, go to the <strong>View</strong> tab.</p>
<p>2. Under Views, click <strong>Filter Messages</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;On the drop down menu, choose <strong>Show All messages</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This may just be a consequence of your view settings. Try varying them to see if the 'missing' messages reappear (they can't be really missing if Search finds them). On the
<em>View</em> tab, </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>Conversations</em> and select <em>Off</em>. This will stop messages being grouped together by subject, which can mean that a message gets hidden behind another with the same subject.</li><li>Click <em>Message list</em> and select <em>One-line view</em>. This shows you the message details in tabular form, and you can rearrange the table to suit. You can right-click on a column heading to add and remove columns and&nbsp;change their order and you
 can sort by clicking on a column heading.<br />
Since you're missing messages from a particular sender, you could sort by <em>From</em> to group all messages from this sender together in date order.</li></ol>
<p>You can simply reverse the commands in (1) and (2) to revert to the view settings you had before if you prefer them.</p>

            <p>YES !&nbsp; For me, the Conversations unchecking did the trick.&nbsp; What was originally a baffling exercise in trying to figure out WLM logic to preparing to repair WLM to going to another email client altogether, this was a pleasant surprise. &nbsp;VOILA', the missing
 Inbox entries reappeared!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this was low-hanging fruit, I tried this tack first before tackling the other options.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure what the Microsoft designer was thinking but boy was it counter-intuitive.&nbsp; Anyway. thanks.</p>

            <p>If you delete the recovery partition, you will lose the primary source of recovery and also the primary source of recovery disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you make the disks and then delete the partition, you will have to rely upon only the disks for recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer manufacturers do not always supply or even have recovery disks available for sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to delete the recovery partition to make way for a partition in which to store backups, you should re-consider because backups should be stored on media which can be isolated from the computer, not stored on the most hard worked hard drive in
 the computer.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note too that any partition created by you would be wiped out, data and all, in the event that you used your recovery disks.. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Laptop gets blue screen 0xc000021a error when resetting</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that came with windows 10. I chose the option to do the reset while keeping my files, and it was going fine until i reached the screen with the hp logo and the loading icon underneath. It was taking a long time so I left it on overnight,
 but by the time I woke up it was still going so I did a force shutdown. After turning it on again, I got a message that said "there was a problem resetting your PC, no changes were made". Whenever I try to reset it again, I end up getting the blue screen with
 the stop code&nbsp;0xc000021a. Any suggestions on how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to Set the Default Positioning on the Screen of Opening new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williammillerco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Set the Default Positioning on the Screen of Opening new Instances of Apps</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 I often work with multiple instances of programs. Specifically right now I am trying to work with Excel 2013. I have figured out how to have Excel and other Apps remember the size of the window last opened, but I can't figure out a rhyme or
 reason for where on the screen it positions the new window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example: previously, using Excel 2010 in Windows 7, I would want to open additional Excel spreadsheets snapped to the left side of the right monitor on a two-display setup. Because opening the new Excel document from windows explorer would by default
 open the new spreadsheet in the same instance of Excel all I would have to do is position that instance where I wanted it and all additional spreadsheets would open in that same screen position.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Excel 2013 opening additional spreadsheets from File Explorer opens them in a new instance. As I said, I have figured out how to make those the size I want them, but I also want them to open in that specific position (snapped to the left side of a screen).
 Is there a way to do this?</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 will not detach, button just glows red</h2>
                    My surface&nbsp;book is a few months old and I've never had this problem before now but the issue is that the tablet won't detach from the base. When I hit the detach button from the keyboard or from next to the taskbar, it glows red for 10 seconds and just
 stops glowing without giving any pop-up on why it can't detach. I have tried closing all my apps and trying to hit again and I've tried the 2 button power off to see if it would work upon rebooting but nothing has worked so far. Can I get some help on the
 issue?&nbsp;

            Hello FZI30,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. Let's sort this out. However, to be able to understand the issue better, can you give us more details by answering these following questions:<br />
<br />
• When was the first time you've encountered this issue?<br />
• Can you tell us if you've pressed the detach button while the Surface Book 2 is hibernating or that the device wakes up from sleep?<br />
• Were there any changes made prior to his matter?<br />
• Any error messages/codes appeared on the screen after the detach button turned red?<br />
• What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?<br />
• Can you confirm if the device has the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest firmware/drivers update</a> installed?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can help you further.

            You haven't stated if you are using a Xbox 360 or a Xbox One. If you are trying to install on a Xbox One, then the whole game installs without the need to install the 2nd disc. If you are using a Xbox 360, then you do not need to install the discs.

<p>Make sure you are using the latest version of Skype for Windows desktop. &nbsp;I do not recall custom audio options existing in the Skype for Windows 10 app. &nbsp;If your custom audio does not play in the latest desktop version, try importing your audio samples into
 an audio program like Audacity and exporting the audio. &nbsp;Some people have had playback issues with some audio formats in the latest versions of Skype for Window desktop (even when they worked in the past).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 email folders</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10 I realized that although my mail folders were created, they only contained a portion of the items previously in them. What happened?

            <p>I researched this a little more and it appears that during the Windows 10 conversion, only items contained in folders with dates subsequent to 5/15 were transferred to the new Windows 10 folders (those prior were not). Many of us have emails in folders prior
 to the 5/15 date which are critical to us. Please check this out and provide information relative to a resolution to this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, exactly what needs to be done! Very naughty MS 'cos you promised our files would not be affected. This implies that everything would be where it used to be.</p>
<p>You really should give people a heads up (I think they are called 'Message Box') to let them know what you are or are not doing... not that difficult really, and takes the onus off users to figure out what is going on or making them hunt around your 'how
 to' categories.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 31 with Nvidia GeForce 9800 S cards.__</h2>
                    
<p>I don't remember having this problem when I first got this HP Firebird 802 more than a year ago but now when I go to device manager I have a problem. Under display adapters, both my NVIDIA GeForce 9800 S graphics cards have the yellow exclamation mark next
 to them. When I right click and go to properties for them it says " This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)." I have tried the Microsoft Fix program that automatically finds and fixes
 the problem, or so it says, and it reinstalled the drivers and made me restart my computer but this didn't and hasn't worked(I've tried about three times now). NOTHING comes up from google for this problem and I fear the worst. I don't know if this has ruined
 my graphic capability for games such as SC2 and Fallout 3 but they don't really run as smooth as I think they would on medium settings.</p>
<p>PC SPECS:<br />
Vista x64 bit, up to date(SP2)</p>
<p>Dual NVIDIA GeForce 9800 S</p>
<p>NVIDIA nForce 760i SLI</p>

<h3> ernesto tortillas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shield icon over application icon won&#39;t go away after trying compatibility settings</h2>
                    
<p>This weekend i had problems with app that kept on crashing.&nbsp; I tried to enable compatibility settings in the properties of the shortcut to the app.&nbsp; The shield icon started to appear over my app icon.&nbsp; So i see the app's original icon with a small blue and
 yellow shield over it.&nbsp; (I think they call it the UAC shield).</p>
<p>It didn't fix anything, it turns out the version of the app may have a bug, the developer is looking into it.&nbsp; It's an app that came out this year.</p>
<p>I then turned off all compatibility settings and unchecked all "run as administrator" boxes.&nbsp; The shield icon is still there over the app icon.&nbsp; I uninstalled the application, reinstalled, made sure all compatibility settings were unchecked a few times...&nbsp;
 The shield icon is still there.</p>
<p>The solution i found is to install the app in another directory.&nbsp; Then the icon is fine and the app works the same (the crash still happens, but this is not related to windows 7, i think, as it happens in win xp too on another computer)</p>
<p>Where does windows keep such settings ?&nbsp; I'd like to remove what makes windows "think" this app needs a special treatment.</p>
<p>I want to understand what's going on.&nbsp; I'm usually good with computers but not familiar with Windows 7 yet.</p>

<p>Hello Gokul T,</p>
<p>thanks for taking the time to answer.&nbsp; What i do not understand is that if i install the same application in another directory, the shield icon is not there.&nbsp; It was not there before i tried to change compatibility settings, which are now reset.</p>
<p>Also, if i run the app under 256 color mode, the uac shield is not there.</p>
<p>Seems like it is stuck there for some reason...</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hello Ernesto Tortillas,</p>
<p>I haven't tried this but you might want to rebuild the icon cache and see if that helps.<br />
Before making any changes I would do a system restore point.</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/how-to-rebuild-the-icon-cache-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link here for instructions on rebuilding icon cache</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure if it will help but may be worth a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>I'm opted in for the Xbox Newsletter yet I haven't received one in like 2 years. I have no email addresses blocked and it's definitely not in my spam folder. Could someone please help me?</p>

<p>You may want to change the e-mail address under the contact preferences just as a test to another e-mail provider. I know I receive them and I currently have my e-mail setup as a yahoo. This is just a suggestion to see if maybe the company you are using
 to receive your e-mails might be filtering the newsletters out automatically as I have seen something like that happened before with certain e-mail providers. Changing the e-mail under there would mean that you'd need to wait until another e-mail would be
 sent out to check this out. They usually end up sending out 1-3 e-mails a month but unfortunately not at a specific date.</p>

<p>Hey I CrossBones I! I'm sorry for the experience! We definitely don't want to be preventing you from receiving emails. Have you tried as Hassassinade suggested and added an alternate contact preference (<a href="https://live.xbox.com/MyXbox/ContactPreferences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../ContactPreferences</a>)
 as a test? Have you also checked your email preferences and confirmed that the newsletters aren't sending straight to your 'delete/trash' folder? They should be arriving from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". Just trying to make sure we've covered all the bases, more looking
 for confirmation rather than asking you to do basic steps! I appreciate your cooperation. :)</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that, I CrossBones I. I would recommend setting up a rule to send emails from the address Miss Kleo mentioned to a special folder. That way if an email comes in the future you can be sure it won't be marked as spam. Otherwise, signing up for
 the Newsletter using another address as a test to see if you are able to receive them to a separate inbox would be a good next step as Mister Barakus mentioned.</p>

<p>I'm having major issues with my Splinter Cell DA too. &nbsp;I got an update from Xbox just after putting the game in. &nbsp;Then I played the training mode as a refresher. &nbsp;After that the Xbox said the disc was not feasible or needed to be cleaned. &nbsp;Since then I've
 been getting the same message and can't play anything...but if you leave the disc in it will still play the little intro and everything. &nbsp;It just won't play the actual game.

<h2>            Cannot send e-mails from Windows Live Mail.  Tried repairing Message Store - now I cannot open WLM at all&#33;&#33;  Please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Like PeteHowell (Nov 12,2012) I have been unable to SEND or REPLY to E-mails using WLM since Nov 8th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the same message reported by PeteHowell ("a problem occurred while trying to open this message.......")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried uninstall, and re-install WLM.&nbsp; I have cleaned my hard disc.&nbsp; I have tried "Repairing Windows Live Essentials" - none have solved the problem.&nbsp; Current Version of WLM is now 2012 (Version 16.4.3505.0912)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the Answer from Garry V, posted on 13 November, suggesting a solution to "Repair the Message Store, using CMD".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just implemented this Solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I cannot open WLM at all!!&nbsp; I get a message saying" WLM could not be started.&nbsp; Unable to open message store, it may be being used by a virus scanner.&nbsp; Wait until finished, and try again. (0x800c0155,2)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise urgently how I can get WLM working., and able to send e-mails.&nbsp; Please reply to my hotmail e-mail address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Jankara,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I followed the advice of your Garry V, posted here on 13 Nov, to repair the Message Store, using the following CMD command:&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><span><span><span>esentutl.exe -d "%<span>userprofile</span>%\<span>AppData</span>\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\<span>Mail.MSMessageStore</span>"</span></span></span></b></p>
<p>Since doing this, I cannot open Windows Live Mail at all.&nbsp; I get Error Message: "WLM could not be started.&nbsp; Unable to open message store, it may be being used by a virus scanner.&nbsp; Wait until finished, and try again. (0x800c0155,2)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I cannot open WLM to check for any e-mails in Outbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have, yet again, un-installed WLM, and then re-installed, using the Wizard.&nbsp; Still cannot open WLM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect I have to do a "Clean Install" of WLM.&nbsp; How do I do this??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Message Store has been corrupted by following Garry V's advice, do I have to delete this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Peter Hornsby</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue could be caused by your antivirus interrupting on your Windows Live Mail, try reinstalling the program or repairing it while your antivirus is turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Just turn off your antivirus program to test if this contributes the issue. After trying kindly enable it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the steps marked as answered on this post having the similar error you have.</p>

<p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. of 29 November:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have managed to repair the Message Store, by deleting it, then starting WLM, which then re-builds a new Message Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I still have the problem that I cannot send or forward any e-mails from WLM - this problem has persisted since 13 November.&nbsp; (Message is" A problem ocurred while trying to open this message.............."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have carried out: repair of WLM (3 times), Uninstall and Re-install WLM (twice), create new e-mail User Account, Clean up of files on Hard Disk, turning off Virus&nbsp;Program........all to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think my only option now is abandon WLM, and move to another e-mail program.........??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Media Center &#47; XBOX 360 Extender &#40;crashing &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leporaj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Media Center &#47; XBOX 360 Extender &#40;crashing &#38; freezing issues&#41;</h2>
                    <p>There are some other questions that halfway hit this and don't hit this issue - consider the below scenario and confirm if others are having the issue / troubleshooting efforts / and is MS is truly aware.
</p>
<p>It's a little frustrating since it's an included (well at cost or free till jan) component, and hinders us from adopting Win8 as our Media Center machine:
</p>
<p>Setup: </p>
<p>1) Windows 8 Pro with Media Center add on - assumption is this machine (in my case ceton) is running your home tv infrastructure - either basic cable / cable card / etc. - again in my case i'm running ceton - using the latest win 8 beta drivers (sure they
 are beta - lets not limit it to that being the cause though) <br />
<br />
2) Xbox 360 as media center extender - this is my set-top box, obviously using media center extender on this to watch premium tv, recordings, etc
<br />
<br />
Scenario issues: <br />
<br />
So, Windows 7 worked like a champ with the above scenario. Streaming fine to my Xbox, I was in a land of joy. Upgraded to Windows 8 ... so long as I use MCE local to the Windows 8 box, all is smooth. Once I attempt to watch it via extender from Xbox 360, it
 goes horribly bad ... issues noted below: <br />
<br />
Issues with the setup noted above: <br />
<br />
1) The MCE app will occasionally just&nbsp;freeze up&nbsp;and crash, returning me to the Xbox 360 dashboard.
</p>
<p>2) Assuming i'm watching a program, if I bring up the guide and try to navigate to find another channel - it will freeze up and eventually lose connection to the Windows 8 machine. I've had limited success stopping playback of live tv, then searching the
 guide and selecting a program to watch. </p>
<p>3) Frequent network performance warnings - and lag / freezing in TV recordings. Network bandwidth tests indicate all is great (which I already knew since this was working with Win7)
</p>
<p>I'll post some of the eventview errors from Win8 when I get home, but i do see some errors reported about MCE abruptly crashing, however searching that data didn't really conclude anything. This issue is able to be duplicated for me on multiple Xbox's -
 wired and wireless. I think it's a common problem for others, but unable to confirm here locally since my friends said well if you're having these issues, we'll stick on our Windows 7 media center machines for now.
</p>
<p>Others experiencing this? Thoughts / Suggestions? </p>

            I had this Same issue. I was able to fix it by updating the Network driver. in device manager see which make and model network card you have then use the manufacture driver,&nbsp; as it is Microsoft driver causing the issue,&nbsp;use the windows 7 if no windows
 8. Good luck.&nbsp;

            Hi Jeanette
<br />
<br />It depends on the location you are calling, there are different rates for different locations
<br />
<br />Click this link: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/</a>
<br />
<br />Type in the name of the country you are calling
<br />
<br />That will show you the available subscriptions
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the resulting page, click 'See All Rates' that will show you the cost per minute and connection fee for calling without a Skype subscription . . .

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using storage spaces with 2 drives in mirror for quite some time now with no issue, but since a few day, I noticed that abour 25% of my cpu was used by the system process.</p>
<p>I did a performance analyses with xperf and it revealed that the cpu was consumed by lots of refsv1.sys and spaceport.sys process inside the system process.<br />
</p>
<p>I also notices that when I open storage spaces control panel, the window takes some time to open and then freezes randomly.<br />
Disks looks OK, files are readable or writable.<br />
No problem with the rest of the system.</p>
<p>No storage jobs running (Get-StorageJob)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's going on. I will try to unplug one of the disk, or delete the storage space completely and make a new one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No new programs, no change.</p>
<p>Reboot does nothing, the system process is already at 20% after logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of the performance record I did&nbsp; :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b0b75fc-9bc6-43d5-87ab-32898675fe7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b0b75fc-9bc6-43d5-87ab-32898675fe7f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged both drives and the problem is gone.</p>
<p>And no more laggy space storage control panel window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result of performance record after removing the drives : system process &lt; 1%, no more refsv1 and spaceport.sys.</p>
<p>Everything back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f724306-1f70-4abe-93e9-c00be4b5caeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f724306-1f70-4abe-93e9-c00be4b5caeb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I will build a new storage pool from scratch, move the data on it, and delete the old one.</p>

            I am having exact same issue, with similar config, (disks in mirror). This is an issue, and this is probably going to get bigger and bigger. I've noticed the issue for some time already and I suspect some update fked up REFS drivers to cause this behavior.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are experiencing this problem and that's what we are going to figure out. To isolate this concern, we suggest that you boot the computer in Safe Mode with networking.
This will start your Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. Please follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Once in Safe Mode, kindly observe if you will still experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem doesn't exist at all times - sometimes it's after 30 minutes of computer runtime, sometimes after 3 hours. I did boot to safe mode for couple of minutes but didn't really have the patience to "sit down" and reproduce the problem. It might as
 well occur only when there is a standard usage of PC only - it won't happen when the PC is idle. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Crash&#58; Blank Black Screen</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>I installed Windows 7 Home Professional today. It has crashed twice. Both times it was while I was using Adobe After Effects (maybe
 coincidence?). The screen goes all black while I am using my computer, and absolutely nothing will wake it back up. My power light is still on, and my battery is not dead. The only way to get back on is to power it off and restart it. I've lost quite a bit
 of work so any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Mucho Thanks!</span></p>

            i had a slimier problem i did some trouble shooting and found that it was not windows 7 causeing the problem rather it was the away mode settings in the bios of my computer I'm running 64bit ultimate instead of going straight to the troubleshooter go into
 devices and printer if the device labeled the same as your tower has the warning icon on it you may have the same problem but it you not computer savvy you may want to have someone that is check your bios setting i have not had the blank screen in 24 hours
 since i made the change so it may not be the ati driver at all&nbsp; <br />

<h3> davidpet86  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio for DRM Content - Movies and TV as well as Netflix App</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Whenever I play DRM content natively in Windows 10 1709, it won't play the audio on my 4k LG OLED65C8 TV. &nbsp; I have 2 different computers that have the same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer 1:</p>
<p>- Intel NUC7I5BNH&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Intel Audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer 2:</p>
<p>- Dell Zino AMD Processor</p>
<p>- AMD Audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both computers are fresh new Windows 10 installs with all driver updates and exhibit the exact same behavior:</p>
<p>1. Movies &amp; TV personal Videos - Audio &amp; Video work</p>
<p>2. Movies &amp; TV purchased Videos - Video but NO audio</p>
<p>3. Netflix Windows 10 App - Video but NO audio</p>
<p>4. Netflix via Edge Browser - Audio &amp; Video Work</p>
<p>
</p><p>As both computers exhibit the same behavior but have different audio vendors (Intel vs AMD), I figure it has something to do with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both computers plugged into my old 1080p TV work fine in all scenarios</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple MacBook plugged into the new LG TV playing DRM content from iTunes works for both audio &amp; video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a brand new tv with new 4k HDMI high speed cable.&nbsp; I've also tried many different HDMI cables with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's with native Windows Apps that can't play DRM content?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge you're experiencing with playing DRM content on your 4K TV might be caused by a misconfiguration of the app settings. It would be great if you can tell me more about your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Are both computers <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">up to date</a></strong>?</li><li>Can you tell me the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of each computer? You can find this information by clicking the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest performing these troubleshooting steps that can help you resolve the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Run the Windows apps troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>This tool will scan and fix your PC for any issues detected with your apps. Make sure that you're signed in as the administrator to run the tool. You can get the tool from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store: run the troubleshooter">
<strong>page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Repair or reset the affected apps</strong></p>
<p>If a Windows app isn't working properly you can repair or reset it to its default configuration. Please note that resetting an app will delete app data and sign in information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt; go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Select the affected app.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Repair</strong> or if the issue remains, <strong>Reset</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the troubleshooter for Video playback issues</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that your computer is connected to the 4K TV before running this tool. The automated troubleshooter will scan the device for any misconfiguration and fix them for you.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> button.</span></li><li><span>Type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> and then hit
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Video Playback</span><span> under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Find and fix other problems</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run the troubleshooter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a new user profile</strong></p>
<p>A corrupted user profile can cause this kind of error in Windows 10. For isolation of the playback issue, I suggest creating a new user profile and monitor if the issue occurs. You can find the steps on how to create a new user profile in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10">support article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to the results.</p>

<p>Hi Devlon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.431).&nbsp; No error messages, just no audio with DRM content.&nbsp; Both computers have no updates to install according to Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried all the recommendations on both computers with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I watch the Volume Mixer, there are green bars showing when Audio does play and no green bars when audio doesn't work so seems as though it's not even sending the audio out under DRM scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. For further isolation of the issue, can you tell me the file formats of the videos that you're trying to watch on your 4K TV? There's a possibility that the sound issue is caused by the format of the video files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we're at it, have you tried using a different video player downloaded from the

<p>Hey I got some suggestions for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into settings and go to "Network &amp; Internet."</p>
<p>Then go to status and press "Change connections properties."</p>
<p>Next scroll down to metered connection and switch it on.</p>
<p>This makes it so Windows Update will only install important updates, this does not turn this off fully however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to do is go to the search bar and type "Services."</p>
<p>Scroll until you find "Windows Update."</p>
<p>Right click this and then press "Properties."</p>
<p>Go to start go to startup type and press "Disabled."</p>
<p>And then if it is running press "Stop."</p>
<p>

            Metered connection will not cut it off entirely but it does stop less prioritized updates being download knowing that you will get charged extra.

<p>Dang sorry it didn't work. How is your computer running? Does everything work for you? You have 10 days to roll back again. I have seen other posts that say to disconnect from internet to stop new updates when rolling back. Then run show hide tool. Please
 do some research with google search. There&nbsp; is a lot of information out there and maybe something will help although be&nbsp; careful of some tweaks.Microsoft is very determined to upgrade computers.</p>

<p>I have windows 7 64bit pro.<em>&nbsp; I have been trying to download a programme on my computer that needs - ntvdm.exe - to be able to read it, this I understand is only on windows xp, I have tried downloading the compatibilty programme but has not worked. It
 would seem I am at a dead end and will have to dump an expensive (but old) programme and spend a considerable amount of money on an update. UNLESS there are some clever people out there? Hope you can help?</em></p>

            <p>ntvdm.exe is used to enable 16-bit programs to work on 32-bit Windows. You cannot run 16-bit programs on 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be able to&nbsp;use Windows XP Mode. This runs a copy of Windows XP in a virtual machine alongside your Windows 7 system.</p>
