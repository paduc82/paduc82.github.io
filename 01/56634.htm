                    Bom dia,
<div>minha impressora HP D110 está sempre desconectando, eu fiz um diagnóstico e a informação é de que o problema pode estar sendo causado pelo FIREWALL e pede para que eu verifique se UDP porta 427 está desbloqueado para o tráfego de entrada e de saída. Gostaria
 de saber como faço para solucionar o problema. Obrigado.</div>

            Hi Travis.&nbsp; Regretfully, it sounds like your Recovery Partition may be corrupt.&nbsp; If this is a new machine, take advantage of your Warranty and return it to the store you purchased it from.&nbsp; If this issue is not covered by a Warranty, you will need to contact
 Toshiba and obtain Recovery Disks from them if you havent created a set.&nbsp; There will probably be a small fee for this service.

    <title>Halo 4 Disappointment. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Halo 4 Disappointment.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, now i hope you respect my opinion but i believe that Halo 4 sucks. It was fun for a day and the first few matches but now its like...............gone.</p>
<p>Now why i believe that his game sucks that is because the DMR this gun is SO overpowered. I mean this gun excels in all ranges is you are a skilled marksman. The BR is also underpowered, because the DMR CRUSHES this weapon. Everybody is using this weapon,
 which makes the game not fun. If you go to the halo Waypoint forums, everybody is asking 343 to patch this weapon. 2 weeks later..... nothing. There are tryhards EVERYWHERE to ones that think they are cool and do l33t 360 noscopes like a BAWSH. &nbsp;Campers with
 Active camo will stay near a doorway and when someone walks in, they beat them down or perform an assasination on them. Im raging really hard and i dont have a temper. I nearly broke my headset playing a match. I try to get good like stay with team mates,
 strafe, take it slow but it never happen, the DMR is why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now bring me to the maps. Ragnarok is my MOST HATED MAP. Why you ask? Because the mantis is the most OVERPOWERED vehicle in the map. People just run over to the enemy base and steal the mantis and spawn-trap over and over. ADRIFT is another. They just grab
 the power weapons and just run around like crazy. Solace is another. Active camo in the base and rack up kills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More to come. Spartan ops i thought was fun for he first episode, but then i stopped cause it lost replay-ability very fast. Ive been hitting an xp cap of every matchmaking game of 2981 and spartan ops of 2966. Really? A credit cap? I remember pulling over
 40 kills and like 2 deaths in a game AND still hitting 2981. I feel that you should be rewarded for how you play not some lousy XP cap.</p>
<p>Now I am a Halo nerd. But Halo 4 was a big let down. I will highly keep in mind returning this game. I will probably trade it for COD BOII cause everyone is playing it. AND I hate Black ops to DEATH.</p>
<p>Now i hope you respect my opinion and i will respect yours.</p>

<p>The reason why is i want to earn more kills and less deaths so i can improve. I do use the BR often when im not doing good wit the DMR &nbsp;because once the enemy has almost no shields, a headshot will finish them off. I want a game hat fun, not competitive.
 I have to go like a tryhard to get kills.</p>

<p>You seem to know all the dirty tricks yet keep falling for them. Stop blindly rushing into areas, stop hanging out where the mechs frequent, pick a different load out, but stop ruining the game for the rest of us with cries to have the game patched or nerfed.
 It drives me crazy when people complain that a game is ruined and their reasons are weak and unfounded.

<p>The Mantis is a HUGE target for plasma pistol EMP blasts. Of course, you have to hope that your teammates will take advantage of your EMP, but it's still really easy to at least slow the mech down enough to hope that someone will hijack it.</p>

<p>[quote user="Badmojo2074"]The Mantis is a HUGE target for plasma pistol EMP blasts[/quote]Exactly. I even kind of think the the plasma pistol is sort of OP since you can spawn with it now. I always considered that thing a power weapon. I mean, a gun that
 can take down enemy shield, homes in on targets, and can disable vehicles? And you can spawn with it? And you can spawn with plasma grenades, which blow up vehicles in 2 hits?&nbsp;I think this gun does to&nbsp;much for players to be able to spawn with it.<br />
<br />
As for the OP, I think you just need to adapt plain and simple. If you see dots on your radar, an invisible enemy is about. Be cautious.<br />
<br />
The DMR is not overpowered really. It has the slowest fire rate and has no bleed through. I do great with the Carbine vs the DMR since it has such a high fire rate. The BR is also useful because as you said,it has bleed through so it does damage through shields.
 So I'm not sure why you're complaining when you explained why the BR is useful. Also, the BR or Carbine will usually win over a DMR in mid/close range. Due to these.<br />
<br />
This leads to the DMR being used a lot on the most common weapon used on the most common map, Ragnarok. It's not that it's over powered, it's that people are using the best weapon for the most common map. I can tell you that if you play on a tiny map, assault
 rifles and suppressors will tear enemies up with a DMR.</p>

<p>With sprint and other options/weapons you can spawn with, the Mech is not really a problem for me in this game. I thought it would be a big pain but really, (especially with a good team), it's no big deal to either avoid it or use team work to take it out.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>As far as people grabbing power weapons, well yeah, that's how you win the game. If your team is good enough the other team should NOT&nbsp;be able to hog ALL the power weapons and vehicles&nbsp;on the map. I your team isn't good enough to overcome the other team,
 blame your team and their lack of skill, not the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Camping for me isn't a big issue because I have the option to spawn with the same weapons and use active camo just like the enemy. So, if a guy kills me 2+ times behind the same wall or door way, I just play different. Approach the area differently or not
 alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>I personally don't see the DMR as being too over powered. I think it's a great weapon for hitting enemies that are off at a distance of course, and in the right hands, it's a very deadly weapon, but that could be said for a lot of weapons in a game. I've
 seen some players who can use the sniper like it's nothing. doesn't make it over powered. And again, there is a choice of weapons that you can choose from if you get bored with one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;not to sound like a smart ***, but&nbsp;your saying that your going to trade in a game that you don't like for a game who's previous verion you hated, just because "everyone is playing it"? And, you nearly broke your headset during a match? Might be time
 to take a break from the game, and games in general, that make you rage.</p>

<p>I agree with this pretty much. I LOVE the AR in Halo but I know when to use it. On smaller maps, and on some game types like KotH, the AR is better than a DMR for me because a lot of the action is upclose and in your face trying to capture the hill. On a
 map like Ragnork, a long range weapon like the BR, Carbine, or DMR work better for me.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 to TV Hook up, audio skipping</h2>
                    Good morning.&nbsp; I am using the Windows 7 64 Bit OS, ATI HDMI Output, and connecting to a JVC HD61Z886&nbsp; VIA a HDMI Cable.&nbsp; When I try and play a movie, whether from Windows Media Manager or iTunes, the audio will skip every couple of seconds.&nbsp; I have checked
 updates and actually had an update for the Audio Card, but that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; Any Ideas?&nbsp; Thank you.

<h2>            diagnostics policy service not running on Windows 7 home premium</h2>
                    I'm unable to connect to internet through wireless adapter . it says limited access to wi-fi router. When i try to fix this it says diagnostics policy service not running. Checked services.msc While the typeis set up to automatic Unable to start the service.
 It throws error 1297. <br />
<br />
I had similar problem with my LAN connection. After resetting my LAN connection i was able to connect to internet. Tried this on wifi as well but the issue remains.<br />
<br />
This is causing a lot of inconvenience. Need to solution that will not require a reformat.<br />

            Try this:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Go to Device Manager.&nbsp; UNINSTALL your network adapter (do not delete drivers).&nbsp; Reboot.<br />
<br />
Windows reinstalls the device, enables it, and I was up and running.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Overly hyped Registry Cleaners and supposed System Optimizers are like snake-oil and will cause a lot<br />
of issues while fixing nothing. Vista and Windows 7 do not need any Registry Cleaning.<br />
<br />
If you have system issues come here for help. We can also help with System Optimization once we know<br />
your version of Windows and other system information.<br />

<h2>            BITS, WUAUSERV, WINDEFEND not working, in fact missing from the Services List.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a windows 7 Home Basic 64-bit Service Pack 1 in my PC. I noticed one day that I haven't been getting Windows Updates since a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing all research, I've found that the BITS, wuauserv and windefend services are not working. They're not even listed in the Services list. Even the firewall wasn't working, but after trying a few things it started to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a lot of things, microsoft easy fixit 50202, it says "Error: Service BITS failed to start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Windows Update Troubleshooter as well, but not all errors got fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that 538mb Windows Update Standalone Installer Package too, got an error there too, "0x80070424: the specified service does not exist as an installed device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help me. Thanks.</p>

<p>As Smwutches already said: Using someone else's account is a violation of the Microsoft Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you actually have to invite your friend to your house, so your friend will do the setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, be aware that there is no actual "Game sharing" feature. A person can set a console as their Home Console, and that will allow that console to unlock the games of that person for anyone on that Home Console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the owner can always change their Home Console without your knowledge. As I said, this is NOT a mutual game sharing function (as in "I share to your console, and therefore technically your account "has to" share the games to me").&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your friend changes his Home Console to another console without your knowledge, then he also used up his Home Console changes, and you are stuck without his games, even though you still have his console set as your Home Console, and this sharing your
 games to that console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one thing, you should note that it is a violation of the code of conduct to share your account information with anyone. So by doing so in order to game share, you're both putting yourselves at risk for being banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, when your friend tries to change his Home setting, he can try going through help to see if he has a survey available to issue another reset. If not, he will have to wait until they reset on their own.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the computer is not recognizing the
<span>BXT USB 2.0 and Dynex FireWire 800 ExpressCard adapter, I would suggest you to verify in device manager if it is listed in other devices.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have the drivers for BXT USB 2.0 and Dynex FireWire 800 ExpressCard adapter?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have the drivers, first try to install the drivers on your laptop and later try to connect it and check if
 it’s getting detected. You may also try to access Dynex FireWire manufacturer’s website and verify if you can get the latest drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not work you may have to contact the laptop manufacturer to verify if the laptop supports BXT
 USB 2.0 and Dynex FireWire 800 ExpressCard adapter and if you need to install any updates for it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Why has an important Win10 &#34;Critical Error&#34; thread been shut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turnbuckle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why has an important Win10 &#34;Critical Error&#34; thread been shut down when the real solution has not been found</h2>
                    <p>I believe throwing of "Critical Error" message in Win10 was a mistake.&nbsp; The&nbsp;presumed fix that Windows is supposed to effect on restart does not usually work.&nbsp; There is, in my judgment, no permanent fix yet forthcoming from Microsoft.&nbsp; In this sense, the
 whole business of operating system reliability is reminiscent of Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a real-time "solution" (but not a permanent) fix.&nbsp; It works on three of my Win 10 machines.&nbsp; When the OS throws this error DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE CRITICAL ERROR DIALOG...i.e., don 't allow it to do the restart.&nbsp; Instead, the trick is
 to get an instance of file Explorer open.&nbsp; This can be done while the error dialog is thrown because you still have the ability to launch or open an existing app.&nbsp; The second step is to open Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del which may be the only thing that consistently
 works in a Microsoft OS!), and use it to examine the Explorer application process.&nbsp; If you are lucky, you will find the "End Task" button will instead be reading "Restart."&nbsp; Just press that, and the OS will fix itself without rebooting and without pulling
 down your open apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if the Explorer app in Task Manager's Applications doesn't show "Restart," you can orderly closed down apps until eventually only Explorer is left, and at that point the button in Task Manager will be "Restart."&nbsp; Of course, you could pull down open
 apps yourself while the Critical Error message is displayed, and then you could fire its restart button.&nbsp; This may, or may not, work.&nbsp; In any event, you are guaranteed to see the Critical Error message again at some point in the future when you try to use
 Cortana or type in the Start field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, this workaround is a bit ugly, but at least open processes will in all likelihood be preserved which during a force restart would be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, if you are listening, you better fix this Win10 problem.&nbsp; It's enough to make folks like me switch to something better.&nbsp; And, don't ever lock up a thread until a problem is permanently fixed.&nbsp; In this case, a fix in the form of an OS update hasn't
 occurred.&nbsp; Otherwise, this nonsense wouldn't be in my face all the time.&nbsp; Ugly...very, very ugly.</p>

    <title>Using Contacts for Envelopes in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joek_home  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Contacts for Envelopes in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>When&nbsp; using Word 2007 in Vista I could address an envelope by clicking on the 'Address Book' icon and selecting the address from my "Contacts" when in the "Envelopes and Labels" Box.<br />
<br />
Since upgrading to Win 7 that 'Address Book' icon is no longer present and I can find no way to access or use the addresses in my contacts which are still there.<br />
<br />
I am not using Outlook nor do I have Exchange, but I didn't have them prior to the updat either.<br />
<br />
What is the fix for this?&nbsp; I am getting really tired of haveing to type in addresses for maiings that I already have on my PC.</p>

<blockquote>Exactlly as your link shows 'without' the 'Address Book' Icon with the dropdown arrow.</blockquote>
<br />
See my response earlier.<br />
Word will ONLY use the Outlook Contacts folder for address data.<br />
How you actually were using something else in Vista I don't know.<br />
<br />
The reason the Addressbook icons aren't there is because you don't have Outlook.

Will a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2000 work with a Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Receiver 1.0?<br />
<br />
It will work with a Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Receiver 2.1. So perhaps the operation frequencies are different?<br />
<br />

<p>It seems that mice, when purchased as a Desktop set, are "coded" somehow to only work with the Receiver for that set. A bit logical, I suppose.</p>

<h2>            Urgent problem needs urgent help. Really weird issue.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, first post on these forums because before today there was no reason to post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, today I come to you with a unique problem.</p>
<p>As of lately, I have not been able to do anything on xbl which requires an active internet connection, (black ops mostly) to help you understand the situation i will give you one of the many examples of my recent games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game starts, everything is working smoothly. Then about one minute - two minutes into the game my mic stops working and i can't move. Suddenly it says connection interrupted and i am put back into the main lobby, while all my friends/recent players remain
 in the same game. This has been going on for about two days now and it is really frusturating, it seems i can't go more than 5 minutes without lagging out of something, be it the pre game lobby, or the actual match. Also, i don't know if this matters but every
 time i restart my console it doesnt start up with an active connection. Instead, i am disconnected from my network and i have to find it again &nbsp;and connect to it, whereas before i would start my xbox automatically connected to a network/xbl. I have restarted
 my router and xbox multiple times btw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Emails signature on Window Live Mail</h2>
                    Where the **** is set / change your email signature for windows live mail?! Been looking for ages. Was easy on previous email client version. Where is Microsoft hiding it this time? It should be OBVIOUS even to someone no looking for it, let alone someone
 actively looking for it. Windows Help FAQs just gives me irrelevant info about electronic signatures. I need to change my email address after changing ISP provider. So please can someone tell me where in the Windows Live Mail toolbar I can (re)set my signature
 at the bottom of my emails?

            Hi,
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/resolution-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deploy...</a>
<br />
<br />8007042B - 0x4000D
<br />
<br />Cause
<br />The installation failed during the second boot phase while attempting the MIGRATE_DATA operation. 
<br />This issue can occur due to file system, application, or driver issues.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

    <title>Problems when trying to switch between programs using Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghjkdthgg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems when trying to switch between programs using Taskbar</h2>
                    <div>Sometimes (many times, actually) I have a problem when I try to switch focus&nbsp;between opened programs via clicking their respective icons on Taskbar. I click it, and nothing happens.
<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d135cf4a-dba7-4820-b093-8052a1f3ecdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d135cf4a-dba7-4820-b093-8052a1f3ecdf" /></a><br />
</div>
<p>Here I have Edge and IE running. Then I start OneNote via Start Menu. When I click on OneNote icon on Taskbar, nothing happens. I see the app maximizing and minimazing thanks to semi-transparent taskbar, but the focus is not shifted towards this window.
 Never. No matter how many times I click it. The only way to see it is to minimize both Edge and IE, in this case.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't really understand why this happens, because sometimes switching focus works just as it should, and sometimes this thing happens. I can't find out what causes this bug to happen.<br />
<br />
For the notice: it doesn't happen just with OneNote like in this example. It happens with edge, Word, PC games, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to appear after the last update.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I tried:<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> run <em>sfc /scannow</em>. Result: scan found no issues; my problem still persists.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>run regedit, goto <span><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</em>, and set the
</span><em>ForegroundLockTimeout </em>key's value from 200000 to 0. This seems to work for now, I will write here if the issue comes back later (after some time or after a reboot).</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>When the taskbar&nbsp;buttons are set to always combine and hide labels, the little&nbsp;mouse hover&nbsp;windows click to focus.</p>

            You don't understand the problem... It has no connection to combined icons whatsoever. I can't switch focus between programs via clicking on icons on taskbar, that is the problem. It just happened in my example that I had 2 Edge windows opened, but when
 I have 1 Edge window opened, the problem is still there.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>So your problem has nothing to do with focus at all. You problem is you taskbar buttons are not responding. So what happens when you use the ALT and TAB key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 2&nbsp;instants of edge open in your screenshot. As so do I now and look what happens when I click the button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8b1ea18-f414-475f-acf3-2c71087d3273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8b1ea18-f414-475f-acf3-2c71087d3273" height="493" width="676" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have one&nbsp;instants open and use the button the windows minimize and maximize. Except for IE it show how many tabs I have open. If I have 1 instants of a every program open,, using the button then puts the window into focus, or on top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have tablet mode enabled? What are you mouse settings? How is you memory do you have enough? what are your taskbar settings? Did you try never combine taskbar buttons? Do thumb nails ever come up?</p>

            <p>Hi!<br />
Okay, so:<br />
0a) Even when every program has 1 instance running, the problem still persist. Say, if I had 1 instance of Edge and 1 instance of IE and then were to open a OneNote via Start Menu, I would still have the same exact problem. I click on OneNote icon on Taskbar,
 and nothing happens! (By default it should bring OneNote window to the front, but that is not happenening no matter how many times I click its icon).<br />
0b) This is a very strange issue, as it presents on all 2 of my PCs now: this notebook and a desktop PC at home. However, if clicking OneNote in the example above on home PC never does bring its window to the front, clicking it multiple times on notebook occasionally
 does bring it up. I can't find the reason for such behaviour..<br />
1) No, tablet mode is not enabled.<br />
2) Yes, the amount of free&nbsp;RAM is more than enough<br />
3) Taskbar settings: always combine, taskbar is pinned, at the lower part of the screen. No "autohide", no "small icons".
<br />
4) Yeah, tried the "never combine" option; no effect.<br />
5) Yes, thumbnails do always come up correctly. </p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>It sounds like the taskbar is responding. This is how I trouble shoot so you don't have to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So look at the apps first is it just Edge and OneNote or all apps?? I am going with all as I'm not having the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So mouse buttons next. Notebook touchpad?? or USB? Desktop wireless or Bluetooth or wired. In short does mouse respond as expected everywhere else. If yes then we are back to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does right click work on taskbar buttons. There is some settings for more then one desktop or task view W10 calls it. I did not see that button on your taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a lot of taskbar not responding threads, all different issues. Some success with creating a new admin user. I hate creating a user just to test but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I got. Please do post back the fix if you find one.</p>

            <p>Yeah, generally the taskbar&nbsp;does respond (I mean, it's not like it's stucks / freezes / etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue happens with many apps, not only Edge and OneNote. Happens with Office apps too, with apps from Store, with games, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the mouse and touchpad respond and work exactly as they should. No problems with hardware or software here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on taskbar buttons does work, and it brings up a context menu. Nothing unusual, just a regular right click behaviour.</p>
<p>You mean the "swith desktop" button? I removed this "multiple desktops" button from my taskbar, you can do it in menu. I don't use more than one desktop, so I don't need this button and I disabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already using an admin account here :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, for now I did this: "run regedit, goto <span><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</em>, and set the
</span><em>ForegroundLockTimeout </em>key's value from 200000 to 0. This seems to work for now, I will write here if the issue comes back later (after some time or after a reboot)." Edited this into original post as well. For now it works; some time passed,
 and I rebooted the machine a couple of times. So for now it works, but I don't know if the issue is solved completely, or will come back again later.</p>

            <p>Same problem, second time to happen in last month. First time fix was Registry fix like yours by changing from 200000 to 0. Worked up to now and then it happened again for no apparent reason....... but I just couldn't remember what I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scoured all the solutions again until I came across yours, which worked originally for me but when I looked at the reg entry it was still at 0. So I decided to change it back up to 200000 and lo and behold it works.</p>
<p>Just as a thought, it was happening with me when I had OneNote &nbsp;open and yours is the only other post I saw with that instance.</p>

<h2>            Why do you need xbox live gold to play fortnite xbox while on other platforms its 100&#37;free to play&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I think that <em><strong>fortnite</strong></em> should be free to play online. Like not every games but some <strong>EXCEPTIONS</strong>. Cmmon Microsoft. Are you not already rich? If its like that id better sell my xbox and buy a ps4. But im not even sure if someone would buy it. XD</p>

<p>Hi i would like to know why you have to pay to play fortnite when it is a free game. It is kind of unfair because there is console such as playstation and nintendo and they could do the same thing as xbox but they dont it is free on both consoles. Technically
 you would have to pay £5.99 a month meaning that it is not free. please take this in mind and i hope you can change this rule. There are people that are and have sold the xbox just to get a ps4 but i am not going to do that because i have faith and i think
 that microsoft could maybe change this rule.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            To my knowledge you have to have PSN as well as Switch Online to play Fortnite online on other consoles.&nbsp; Nothing new here with needing Gold to play it here 😀

<h2>            Issue with IIS and remote desktop connection</h2>
                    <p>My environment is as follows:</p>
<p>I have 3 screens connected to my pc, and the right one is the principal screen and only that one has the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, open IIS, and move the app to the left or the middle screen.</p>
<p>Lock the computer.</p>
<p>I open my laptop with 1 screen, and connect to the other pc.</p>
<p>All the apps that were on the other screens moved to the main screen, but not IIS.</p>
<p>Also, all the options in the context menu for the taskbar didn't moved the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is to go to the pc with the three screens, and manually move IIS to the main screen.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I'm out of ideas. <br />
<br />
Are you quite sure that the messages have been deleted? </p>
<ul>
<li>You could use the <em>Search for a message </em>box to search for a recently-disappeared message.</li><li>Ctrl-Y will show you all your folders, including those that may not be immediately visible.</li></ul>
<p>Anyone&nbsp;trying to troubleshoot this will have to know </p>
<ol>
<li>who the mail service provider is. This will probably be obvious from the part of the email address after the @ symbol. Don't post the entire address - it will be obscured by the forum software.</li><li>how you're connecting to the server. Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. The type of account (POP3, IMAP, HTTP) will be given at the top of the
<em>Server(s)</em> tab.</li><li>what security software you're running - anti-virus, anti-spam etc.</li><li>whether you have any message rules that might be moving messages elsewhere. Open the rules dialogue by pressing Alt-O R.</li></ol>

            <p>OK, thank you. Is Outlook on your Vista machine also accessing the same account via POP3? If so, please check to see whether the Outlook account is configured to leave a copy of messages on the server. The default in all versions of Outlook until 2010 is
 to delete messages once downloaded via POP3. See Diane Poremsky's article <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/email/to-leave-internet-messages-on-the-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
