<h2>            Internet connection regularly drops out and locks up network control centre</h2>
                    In recent weeks my internet connection has been dropping out on a regular basis. When this happens, the network toolbar icon locks up and all access to the Network and Sharing Center also becomes impossible. Eventually, after a minute or two, the connection
 restores itself but in the meantime my downloads have crashed as have any online games I may be playing, I am using a Netgear N300 router with Edimax wireless connectors installed on my 2 computers.<br />
I have tried swapping browsers to no effect, I have also swapped adapters with the same result.<br />
I would like to know what the probable causes may be and/or how to investigate the problem

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode with Networking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts </span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: </span><b><span>Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do not face the issue in safe mode, then put your computer in clean boot and check for the issue.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using Avira Free Antivirus. I have the automatic updates switched off because it has always caused problems by taking over the entire CPU when it updates (this is an old issue).<br />
<br />
I am not aware of any changes although, to be fair, I could not exactly say when the problem started so I can't tie it in to any particular software addition.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you performed the steps provided above? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check for updates manually and see if there is any optional updates available for the network adapter. If yes, try to install the particular update and check with the issue.

            Thanks for the advice. I have checked the drivers and both the adapter + Netgear firmware are up to date. I tried Safe Mode but the Edimax Adapters don't&nbsp; work in Safe Mode. I have now tried the MS Clean Boot option and it does appear to show that "something"
 which is loaded on start up is causing the problem but I have not yet been able to narrow it down. Whatever it is, it can eventually lock up Windows Explorer as well as the Network. At the moment I am running in Clean Boot mode to see whether everything continues
 to work under normal (normal for me that is!) over a period of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Waiting to hear back from Xbox live </h2>
                    I had a hard drive failure and lost my email associated with gamertag. I made a call to MS last week Saturday and have a claim # but curious how to check the status of the claim. How long does this generally take ? I picked up a new hard drive and transfer
 cable but no luck reading the old drive. Any help is appreciated , don't want to waste tech supports time .

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The amount of time it takes to get an update on your case is dependent on the actual issue that you're facing. If you'd like an update you'll want to
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a></strong> or
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">chat support</a></strong> and give them the case number or service request number, and they will be able to see if there have been any updates made to the case.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you weren't able to actually get the e-mail associated with the gamertag on the phone with them if you were able to provide them with the information on the account itself. They usually ask for security questions, billing information, and last
 4 of the card on file, with that information they can successfully confirm that it's you who owns the account and not someone attempting to break into your account. I'm assuming here you weren't able to provide such information or all of the information that
 was requested which is why you were given the case number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I contacted support again and some how the chat person i talked to previosly messed something up and the account wasn't escalated , I don't use cards on the Internet only prepaid MS points from game stop. I gave them the original code I entered when I created
 the account . The women I talked to from MS this morning was very helpful but she says she can't see the email associated with my account and reescalted the account. I question there ability to help only becouse she had to ask advise of another person to make
 sure what she was entering was correct and couldn't find where to put the consol id number which they have from the first two interactions with MS . Now they say it could take up to 2 more weeks before they contact me . They also said they would email me contact
 info to be able to contact the women I talked to this morning , but I haven't received a email yet . I know this takes time and I am patient but don't have a lot of faith in this system. The whole reason I am haveing this problem is due to haveing two xboxs
 and 1 email address. My brother helped me set the second account up 2 years ago and I believe we had to create another email address but have not used it since setup and he has since moved and we have searched through all the info we have and can't find this
 account . Why do I feel this an ongoing problem with under trained help , am I contacting the wrong place for help. I know I could have done better to keep this info together but somehow misplaced it over 2 years and all my other information is in the same
 place as always . The last few days I was online it kept asking me to update security info and I was waiting for my brother to make sure it was done correctly but the hard drive got error code e68 and won't transfer data , I have since bought a new harddrive
 and transfer cable with no luck. I'm still not sure why the harddrive failed after only 2 years , I have never heard of hard drive failure until I started researching my problem . Still seems like a short period of time for harddrive to operate &nbsp;. Thanks for
 any advise</p>

<p>Hi Josh,<br />

I hear where you are coming from. <br />
<br />
Looking into your case, it is in the proper hands and moving along. If you would like to 'push' it along, or inquire about further details, I would suggest giving
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone Support</a>. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the responce, did you personaly look at my account ? I have been doing as much reading as time allows to find out if I did somthing wrong. Is there information missing or any other information that i can provide to make this easier on both
 parties . The first reply I got here says that he/she dosent understand why i didnot recieve the email accotiated with my gamertag on my first phone support interaction ,from what i understand the user would need to provide consol id , ip adress , I even have
 the origional sales receipt and origional 12 month gold membership card from game stop with the code on the back. I do not use credit cards . I personally have not had any luck with phone support &nbsp;or the online chat support ! If anything it has gotten worse
 by contacting them , I origionally contacted them on the sept 26 and they told me they would contact me by email. never happened. Oct 3 I contacted online chat support to check on the status to see what was going on , no info just told me to wait for contact.I
 waited another week and contacted phone support on Oct 9 . The contact told me that she was happy I called becouse the person from chat support did somthing wrong and the claim was stopped.To my knowledge the second contact did nothing but tell me that I had
 to wait to be contacted by some escalation team. The third contact said that i would recieve a 3 month code for xbox live for my inconvienence via email and also her contact information so if there were any more problems i would be able to contact her instead
 of getting another person,never happened! She was unable to help me any further and said it could be up to 2 weeks before I would have contact from the escalation team. From the support I personally have recieved I have no faith that this will be resolved
 in a timely matter or ever for that matter , its as if we are disposable . Are the loyal xbox customers disposable? I personaly have purchased 3 xbox 360 consols and 2 origional xbox consoles.I have been a xbox online user since my first 360, The latest was
 a 360 slim that was supposed to better than the early 360's but that one failed just outside of warrenty also with error 68,2 years and 23 days from purchase to be exact Sept 26 . When this happened I went and purchaced a new hard drive and transfer cable
 the same day.Is there anything I can do to resolve this,or should I spend my time elsewhere? In my personal experiance if the support is this shaddy to help, NOTHING HAPPENS AND THEY EXPECT YOU TO MOVE ON. I sure hope someone looks into this so other people
 aren't miss lead by unknowledgable support . THANKS AGAIN FOR ANY SUPPORT AND INFORMATION IN KEEPING THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN ,OR TO OTHER XBOX CUSTOMERS . If there is any info needed to address this situation I will be happy to provide . Thanks again</p>

<p>Yes I am the same as itsjoshufrubbie , after talking to a supervisor on phone support &nbsp;Friday , it sounds like where on the right track finally , but this whole email quest has been very misleading and drawn out by general phone support. I suggest if anyone
 has a similar issue to make sure the ms support agent &nbsp;is at least knowledgable with &nbsp;what they are doing . Otherwise you will be here a long time trying to correct there mistakes just to correct your own . Thanks again for the help and advise to resolve this
 in a timely matter. &nbsp;I will make another reply once I completely resolved the issue when the advocacy team calls Sunday or Monday . Thanks again and I hope they can help me .</p>

<p>why oh why does every &nbsp;MS phone support person blame the previous support person or people for misinforming and not accuratly entering infomation .I have been waiting since sept.26 for help on my account, &nbsp; every time we get to the last day that microsoft
 is supposed to contact me via email I call support to find out whats going on. The last 3 times I have called they tell me the last person told me the wrong amount of days . The last 2 times I have called they tell me they will contact in 2 more days ,guess
 what ,todays the day they are supposed to contact me and nothing . I allready know if I call they are going to feed me some more B.S.. They have all the correct email and phone numbers to contact me but nothing ! If they would put something in place to tell
 PEOPLE not to use your house number when setting up your xbox live acount this would have been resolved already . they cant see the number they can only tell me it does not recieve text and there nothing I can do but wait for support . stop telling me you
 will contact and just keep adding days to the wait time . Why are the phone support people so useless, it has taken 5 phone calls to get the information accuratly entered to the claim. If it even is yet , i do not trust these people .It took until the 4th
 call to find someone knowledgable enough to enter the consol id number from what they say wasn't there before . I have given the information every time with no luck or help. Just wait 2 more days ! I am very erritated at the results so far as many xbl customers
 are . This whole securing xbl customers from thier accounts is rediculous . I &nbsp;understand things take time but when you tell someone you are going to do somthing you had better do it or you will loose customers that pay the bills. The last phone call I had
 with them said a person named Recardo was looking into my account. This was 5 days ago now , why havent they contacted yet ? I like the xbox system , but I can't play it the way I perfer becouse they wont own up to what they keep telling me and just get in
 contact with me to resolve the issue . thanks and egerly awaiting contact from MS support. can anyone tell me why I would recieve 4 incompetent phone support people in a row from the beggining . the last support member named jacob told me the previous members
 didnot do thier job correctly . Why such the lack of support . please find out whats going on so i can get back to gaming .

<h2>            Windows Update Cleanup</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I run 'Disk Cleanup' the results box tells my there is 5.15 GB of files in the Windows Update Cleanup folder. I accept to delete all files to free up space and it deletes all the files.</p>
<p>If I run 'Disk Cleanup' again immediately after it's finished cleaning the Windows Update Cleanup folder is still showing 5.15 GB od data,</p>
<p>How do I clear this data so it won't come back?</p>

<p>
</p><p>But i all honesty this feature should not be used </p>
<p>Updates are likely going to show back up</p>
<p>Worst case you could hurt your system and I doubt 5gb's is worth that headake :D</p>

            <p>It looks like your external drive is defective. It's also possible that the PCB (usb to SATA&nbsp;controller) is broken. You can run a drive diagnostic if you plug the drive into a PC or Laptop. It doesn't matter if the data cannot<br />be read by the PC, the diagnostics test the drive itself.

<h2>            PC does not go to Sleep Mode in Windows 10</h2>
                    I up graded my desktop to Windows 10 (Home) from Windows 7. Can force it to go to Sleep Mode&nbsp;by clicking Sleep in &nbsp;Power option that is available in Windows (Start) menu. But the PC does not go to Sleep mode automatically as per the settings in the Power
 Options. I have set the Display to go off in 15 mins and Sleep mode to 25 mins. The monitors goes off in 15 mins but the PC stays on all the time. Did not have this problem with Windows 7. Appreciate if someone can help, thank you.

            <p>Good Morning Shiva &amp; Rakesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting this question and answer as well.</p>
<p>I've had kind of the same problem as Shiva, in that I've had to click on the Sleep option in the Power menu to put my laptop to sleep. &nbsp;If I don't do that then, once it goes to sleep automatically, as per my options chosen in the Power Settings Menu, when
 I turn on the laptop again, it starts up again, which means all windows I've left open have been closed. &nbsp;Doesn't help at all then as I have to start up my chrome and reopen all windos again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pointers and help would be deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>

<div>I am unsure what the concern is over time.&nbsp; If you think $50/hour is a good deal and you can afford it - let Best Buy do it.&nbsp; Otherwise - get an inexpensive USB hard drive of LARGE size and start the copy before you go to
 bed and then you have it in the morning.&nbsp; Also note that if that is your only copy of those pictures right now - that's pretty unwise.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try a USB external drive. Costs less than Best Buy doing it and you have a good device to<br />
use. You could also burn them to DVD though that would take a while. Other options are<br />
transfer cables or using a crossover cable. Its either your time or Best Buys and you would<br />
have to spend time taking the computers to them and picking them back up. Start the<br />
copy and go to bed.<br />
<br />
There are 1TB external USB drives available for under $100.00.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>They have a policy of not being contactable regarding making their old games backwards compatible or just replying to any requests about their games in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing else can be done.&nbsp; It's entirely up to them whether they make these BC or not.&nbsp; Also, even if they did do it, this would still have to passed on to Microsoft who would have to make these games BC.&nbsp; This process can take several months of work.</p>

<p>Hello Subzero,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that there are titles for games that you would enjoy to see return to through the backwards compatible program to relive the nostalgia from those titles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is not more information to provide we will be locking this thread, but you can continue to provide this subject to the developer of the game to ensure that word is out there about the return of these titles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We wish you the best!</p>

                    <div>The title says it all. I'm completely locked out my computer when I turn on my computer it says put password. the username says my e-mail but I know my e-mail password and I put it correctly I even login to my hotmail and the password was correct I even
 changed it right now and still I try to type it on my windows 8 locked computer and keep saying wrong password! Doesn't even show me password hint or tells me to reset password. I do not have another user i can switch to or anything I have no idea what can
 I do?? When i try to go to safe mode it tells me to put password for homegroupuser$ which that I'm guessing is another domain administrator account and I never put a password on it on that user. I keep pressing enter with nothing typed on the password and
 it keep telling me wrong password and I have tryd a few different password that I would always use and they are not the right one! I'm the owner of this computer. I can't use a cd or flash drive to reboot my computer because every time i click on them in the
 advanced opioins its always take me to the login screen. I can't do anything go to cmd or safe mode or restore system I'm completely locked out I do not know what to do ugh this would have never happen on my window 7 laptop can anyone please help me with this
 problem!</div>

on my laptop mine too would not go below 10%, turns out windows has a native demo built and stores a lot more&nbsp;junk files that you don`t need, I ran disk clean up, cleared everything that I did not need and analysed my disk again and straight away I was down
 to 1% defrag, windows appears not to defrag junk files (makes sense)&nbsp;so ran defrag again and now 0% perfect. might work for others with same problems.

Have you tried&nbsp;accessing the control panel applet you want by doing Start-Run and then typing in one of the commands shown here:</p>

<p>What exactly are you wanting to "troubleshoot", when did it start, what did you do just prior to it starting, and have you tried a System Restore to a date prior to this "trouble" starting?</p>

    <title>Installed Norton now laptop won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennings182  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Norton now laptop won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>So Norton being stupid you have to install it by going into your emails. My subscription ran out whilst on holiday so I renewed it. But it means going on the Internet without virus protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it and restarted but it won't get past the windows logo. Safe mode doesn't work either as it is stuck on CLASSPNP.sys. Is that my problem? Did I pick up a virus in that short time installing Norton?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing in Windows repair works at all says everything is fine. I've changed bios settings like AHCI/internal lan etc but nothing has worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yous system is not stuck on CLASSPNP.sys - that has already loaded.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system is stuck on what comes <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>after</em></span> CLASSPNP.SYS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the next thing is the CD/DVD drive(r) and you can see in an ntbootlog file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/521855a6-c083-4456-98be-71315651dbc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/521855a6-c083-4456-98be-71315651dbc8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we don't know anything about your system (make, model, etc.).&nbsp; I would power off, unplug from the power and if a desktop physically unplug the power and data cables (<strong>both</strong> cables) from the CD/DVD drive - assuming your system has one,
 then see how things look or if it gets any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, unplug everything except the keyboard and mouse so you just have bare minimum potential failure points in your setup and see if it gets any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still no go tell us your system make and model, if a Dell the Service Tag number, any other peripherals you have plugged in (which should now be none)&nbsp; and maybe get some other ideas.</p>

            It's a Samsung laptop model code NP550P5C-A02UK. As it's a laptop I can't disconnect the cd drive but is that what you think is wrong? Maybe giving it a good clean will help? (don't think I've cleaned it in the 4 years)&nbsp;

<p>Just a theory from experience in the good ol' XP days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to with power off, battery out and unplugged remove slide out the CD/DVD drive and test (power reconnected of course)?&nbsp; It might complain or do something different or it might get further after complaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you slide the CD/DVD drive in and out a few times it might reestablish a marginal connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power off and unplugged for all hardware R&amp;R (remove and replace).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system is "stuck" do you see/notice/hear any hard drive activity from LEDs or by listening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe some other folks will have some ideas too.</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know if physically disconnecting the CD drive will help, but it's actually pretty easy to do on your laptop.&nbsp; It involves only 2 screws.&nbsp; See the video here:&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>What did you mean by "Nothing in Windows repair works"?&nbsp; Did you get to the System Recovery Options menu and try "Startup Repair"?&nbsp; How about System Restore to a point before you installed Norton?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58803fdd-ef66-4e94-a97e-3f0e0766887f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58803fdd-ef66-4e94-a97e-3f0e0766887f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If removing the CD drive didn't help and you DIDN'T use the System Recovery Options menu, you should try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to another Windows 7 computer that has the same "bitness" (32-bit or 64-bit) as your ailing laptop AND has a CD/DVD burner, create a System Repair disk:&nbsp;

https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2083-system-repair-disc-create.html</a> (if you have an actual Windows 7 install DVD, you can use that instead).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the System Repair disk, put it in the CD drive of your laptop (after reinstalling the drive, of course), and boot up the computer as described here:

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Windows 8.1 because the I had to change my hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I bought my VAIO&nbsp;SVE14124CLB (I'm in&nbsp; Argentina)&nbsp;in 2014. Last year I had some issues with the hard drive and the IT shop had to change it. Now... they installed windows again but it seems that they installed a pirated version. Windows is asking me to activate,
 but when I type the numbers that are on the sticker on the back nothing happens. Windows says "not valid".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS that's on my computer is Windows 8.1 Pro Build 9600.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to use my computer without that stupid watermark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after they changed the hard drive, I can no longer deactivate the touch pad nor access VAIO ASSIST or even set up the keyboard's lights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told I have to reinstall Windows but whenever I try I'm asked to insert the CD which I don't have!! The laptop already came with Window! There was never a CD!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? I really need my computer for work and school, I have to finish my thesis :(</p>

<br />
If it is some update that is causing the problem you could try using System Restore to go back to before the problem and see if it clears the fault.&nbsp; If it does not you can "undo" the restore and return to the present.&nbsp; If it did fix the problem then you might
 have to reinstall updates one at the time with checking for functionality after each update.<br />

<p>Thank Barb Bowman for your reply<br />
</p>
I have got the good driver and installed it. Thank you for your help<br />
Then i have change my color management setting and added two profil :<br />
surface-srgb.icm (default)<br />
surface-srgb-enhanced.icm<br />
<br />
<br />
Now in settings/action center i can switch between these two profils<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honnest i'm not sur it's working 100% because in don't see any change when i switch<br />
maybe i should install VS++2017 X86 and VS++2017 X64.<br />
<br />

    <title>Win10 Feature Updates alter Screen Saver Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimwae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Feature Updates alter Screen Saver Settings</h2>
                    <p>Every Win10 feature update has changed screensaver settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From:&nbsp; 3DText | Time | high large slow wobble</p>
<p>To:&nbsp; 3DText | Windows 10 | all 4 settings changed</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it were just one computer &amp; 1 user it would not be an issue, but 5 computers with multiple users is an unnecessary nuisance</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO: they have all altered folder permissions for administrator on other users folders</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. May I know the current build version of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried changing the screensaver back?</p>
<p>3. Is this issue happening even after changing the screen saver back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply back with the required information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This has happened with 1803, 1809, and EVERY previous feature update of win10 pro.</p>
<p>I can change it back, and it stays as I want. However, there should be no reason for me to have to do this on every machine for every user every time there's been a feature update.<br />
</p>
<p>What makes it even harder is that I have locked down user desktops with a reg file. To return the screen saver to my (admin) preferred setting, I have to make each user an admin, run my reg file to UNlock desktop, make the changes, run my reg file to LOCK
 desktop again, and then change user back to not be admin... all for each non-admin user on every different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hardly seems worth it for just the screen saver, and sometimes I just give-up on it. However, I cannot see any good reason WHY it would need to be changed from what I had previously established.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the admin rights to user folders is easier, but still annoying.</p>

            <p>The text turns blue because you highlighted it.&nbsp; The most likely explanation for highlighting all the text while typing is due to hitting CTRL-A which is the same as Edit | Select All.&nbsp; Then when you type one character when all that text is highlighted,
 then the highlighted (blue) text is replaced by the one character you typed.&nbsp; Be very careful not to hit the CTRL key instead of the Shift key when typing a capital letter A or else that will happen again.</p>
