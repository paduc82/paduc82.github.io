<h2>            CHKDSK lost all files</h2>
                    
<p><span>I was coping files from primary disk 160GB to secondary disk (160GB) &nbsp;when windows popped telling me to run chkdsk to fix my second hard disk disconnected I cant access my hard disk then<br />
I rebooted and windows started up saying that chkdsk was going to check my 160 gb hd for consistency. It then stated "Deleting orphan file record statement #" over and over again, for over many files.My hard disk space is 160GB and 123GB is full before problem.<br />
<br />
After CHKDSK was finished, Windows started and my secondary disk was completely cleaned. I found some folder named chkdsk.00* ; one of them as some files of the latest that I was coping , but all another my old file disappeared. I tried to run some recovery
 software (getdataback for NTFS) which in the past I had success on some other disk failure.<br />
<br />
It runs for 1 ho 30 min , it seem to found file name that I know (all my jpg pictures), but when it finish all these files are not in the folder created by chkdsk and are not recoverable.and also 3 software but no any 1 file recover.<br />
<br />
In the list of files there is also *.chk files one file size is 10GB.and also 4 gb folders of *.chk. It seem that all NTFS metdata are reconized as simple files. The disk does not seem to have phisical error, so i'm waiting before formatting because my data
 are very important.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to retrieve my data? &nbsp;Is there any way to undo what chkdsk has done?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>There is no way to undo what Chkdsk did and yes, data loss is always a possibility with Chkdsk which is why I like to have data backed up safely elsewhere before running it. GetDataBack is a good data recovery program and if it was unable to retrieve your
 files the only recourse you have now is to send the drive to a professional data recovery company. If you want to make sure you get the data back, don't use any other data recovery programs on that drive. If you absolutely know you won't spend the money on
 professional data recovery and your insurance won't cover the loss (see below), then try<a href="http://www.r-tt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">R-Studio</a> as a last resort.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DriveSavers</a> for my clients who need professional data recovery. General prices run from $700-$2,400. I understand that some insurance companies are now covering data recovery costs so check with
 your insurer. Homeowner's/renter's insurance policies will have the coverage under "Loss of Intellectual Property"; business insurance policies will have the coverage under "Business Interruption".<br />

<h2>            Very slow multiple selection &#40;Files, items, ...&#41; in most windows software</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have had this strange problem since windows 8 (currently on win 8.1) that selection of multiple items is very slow. If I keep the Ctrl button and click on multiple items, they are selected with a 15-20 seconds delay.<br />
<br />
This happens in Windows Explorer (selecting multiple files), in Office (selecting multiple items in visio for example) and some other programs.<br />
<br />
Previously I was able to fix the problem by modifying a registry key (was suggested on a forum) but that solution stopped working after I upgraded to 8.1.<br />
<br />
Is anyone aware of a solution?<br />
<br />
PS: Using keyboard (Ctrl+ direction keys) works fast and without problem.<br />

<h2>            Realtek doesn&#39;t show up in device manager after I installed it</h2>
                    I've installed Realtek multiple times from both the official website of my motherboard manufacturer and the Microsoft catalog. Both times when installing and then reinstalling Realtek, the driver doesn't show up in my Device Manager. Additionally, when
 checking the Realtek folder in Program Files (x86) there is no HDA folder. Does anyone know a solution to this issue?

            Hi  TotallyNotHerro
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of the motherboard?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Click Machine name at the top
<br />
<br />Click the Action menu then scan for hardware changes then check if it shows up in the device tree.
<br />
<br />Also, click the View menu
<br />Click Show hidden devices
<br />
<br />See if it shows up under 
<br />
<br />Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />I suggest you to run the Audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.

<br />
<br />If the issue persists, then try to uninstall and re-install the audio driver.
<br />
<br />    Press Windows  Logo Key+X. Click on Device Manager.
<br />    In the list of hardware categories, look for the device that you want to update, and then right-click on it to Uninstall.
<br />    Follow onscreen instructions to uninstall it.
<br />    To re-install, either you can restart the system or install the driver from the manufacturerís website (recommended as they will have updated drivers).
<br />
<br />For reference:
<br />
<br />Try all the steps provided in the link below and check if it helps.

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R

            Since Windows 10 1803 has been replaced by Windows 10 1903, I would recommend upgrading to see if it works:

    <title>Windows 10 update changed my username - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 update changed my username</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a weird issue here. so the recent update came into place and everything was fine but yesterday I noticed Google Chrome kept saying it can't find my user profile. So i rebooted and again the same issue - I read on the internet that I needed to delete
 the profiles.ini in my local user data folders to get this fixed. However I noticed when going into explorer that all my documents and downloads folders were now marked as hidden (they should not be), right clicking on these files and they all have 'this file
 came from another computer and might be blocked'. Now I know this is absolute b****** (forgive my language) as they were all created on this laptop and on no other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now trying to load various applications, they were all failing to load, checking their logs they were all failing to provide profiles and settings which sit under the user folder. I checked the name of this folder - for example my username (created from
 my microsoft account) is johndoe but here it seems the folder is now called johnd, its missing the last 2 letters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support - they made me download windows 10 again for 4 hours, to install it again and of course nothing was fixed and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get chrome working so I could actually post this, i went and deleted profiles.ini but I don't intend to do that for every application I have as I'd have to google each individual one to find out what file to delete to get it to start. I believe the fault
 here is the users folder being renamed by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a resolution and I want to know why this happened. It's obvious somehow the update changed my users folder and changed my username. Where can I check what the original user name should have been so that I can actually start using my applications again.
 At the moment I have a computer that is pretty much unusable.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same thing has happened to my mothers new computer after a recent update several characters were removed from the end of her username folder leading to re-location of all her stored documents causing a load of issues that she was not able to
 fix herself and I've had to sort it out for her.</p>
<p>Why would an update cause renaming of the user folder?</p>

<h2>            No audio output device installed - after installing windows 7</h2>
                    I installed a copy of Windows 7. Clean install, not an upgrade and not a beta copy.<br />
The computer is now telling me that there is "No audio output device installed"<br />
the sound was working fine prior to installing Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I looked ofr updates to the drivers, but I can't find them.<br />
The motherboard is an ASUS KBV SE Deluxe w\ sound card.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help as to correct this problem would be appreciated.<br />

<h3> marie t-b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I restore Windows Live Mail accounts and emails after doing &#39;refresh your PC without affecting your files&#39;</h2>
                    <p><span>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 but had many incompatibility issues so chose to 'Refresh your PC without affecting your files' to go back to Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, I didn’t export my emails and accounts first from Windows Live Mail. I assumed they’d be automatically saved.</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a way to restore my emails and accounts to Windows Live Mail?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

    <title>Windows update error 80244004 while updating on proxy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ojastripathi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update error 80244004 while updating on proxy</h2>
                    <p>It had been a while since windows automatically updated itself, so I clicked on check for updates and it came up with the error 80244004. I use a proxy that my college provides and it used to update good and well earlier, I have entered the proxy address
 in configure proxy server settings under lan settings. I use lan/Ethernet. it can still update itself when I go home and have access to wifi without any proxy. I checked on other threads and did almost everything from turning off avast internet security(I
 do not use&nbsp;ESET as many people with the same error do)to running windows integrity check program,then I came across a solution that blamed Norton Internet security which came preinstalled so I downloaded there removal tool and ran it,but&nbsp;the problem did not&nbsp;go.&nbsp;I
 have even tried renaming and recreating windows update cache folder or something of that sort as mentioned in one of those threads, I tried to consult a Microsoft engineer at there toll free number 1800 102 1100 (India) but all they could tell me that I should
 stop using Internet security and should only use Internet explorer as my browser(which is lame) then when I insisted they asked my product id and windows license key and then told me that the license key is genuine but the product id is invalid and referred
 me to answers.microsoft.com and now here I am. I assume that my problem therefore is different and hence needs a new thread, any help would be appreciated ASAP, Thanks already.</p>
<p>Operating system&nbsp;:<strong> Windows 7 Home premium</strong> (all updates till 1 October installed thanks to my home broadband/wifi but problem was before and even after that on the college proxy via Lan)</p>
<p>Laptop Model: Samsung NP 355V5C S03IN (India)</p>
<p>Antivirus: Avast Internet security</p>

            <p>Dear Sharief,</p>
<p>If I change the settings as you have told, to<strong> automatically detect settings</strong>, what happens is that I am<strong> no longer able to use the internet
</strong>as it no more asks me of my proxy authentication/login, even then I did what you asked but
<strong>nothing changed and windows was still unable to update</strong>.</p>
<p>So I hope you have a solution that works, thanks for taking out time to reply, any further help is appreciated. Thank you already.</p>

            <p>Mr. Sharief,</p>
<p>Thanks for being so helpful and reply in such a short time. I used the <strong>
netsh winhttp set proxy 172.25.5.6:3128 </strong>to set the correct proxy server and address but still the same problem exists, maybe because it could not ask for the authentication/password for the proxy. So the second one was of no help;
</p>
<p>The first link which tells to make a whitelist, I am not able to do so because I do not know how to make a whitelist for direct unauthorised access, so guide me a little bit more and maybe this problem will be solved. Looking forward to your reply, and once
 again thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>Just a note.&nbsp; My computer has not changed settings since 20009 and I use XP service pac 3.&nbsp; Twice a week I manualy go to the windows update site and down load any updates.&nbsp; Most of them have been on Tues. and Fri.</p>
<p>Yesterday the update gave me the same error code you got.&nbsp; After awhile I got in contact with techs at microsoft and they told me that they could fix it for $99.00 so that I could continue to get updates until April 14 of 2014 when they stop supporting XP.&nbsp;
 I had a discusion with them about this and said that they should continue updates as they always have until that time for free since I was using a paid for OS.&nbsp; They told me there was nothing they could do.</p>

            Dear Sharief,
<div>This is not a problem with everyone in my college, almost all of them with a genuine windows are able to update, it's just me. Besides it used to work earlier so i guess its not the college proxy that's being the problem. Maybe you can not help. Anyways,
 thanks a lot for the concern.</div>

    <title>Read-only nightmare after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gramma21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Read-only nightmare after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I need help! I've upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I'm really enjoying exploring and love the new apps. But while trying to update a document with some information I got, I noticed the document said "read only" when I opened it in Word. After opening
 another that had the same thing, I figured Windows must have turned everything in "My Documents" to read only. No big deal - I know how to straighten that out. So I closed Word and opened Windows explorer and right clicked on "Documents" and chose properties
 and sure enough, the "read only" had a black square in it. So I clicked it to clear it, clicked OK, selected the option to do this to this folder, subfolders and files and waited while it ran through all the files to do so. Then I opened the file with the
 same problem. I've tried everything - individual files already have the "read only" box unchecked. Folders have the black square inside it. But no matter what i do, I can't get these files to open without being "read only". And when trying to save it as another
 file, I cannot even save it under Documents!! The only place I can save it is on the desktop. And that will run out pretty soon!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me figure this out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tina<br />

            <p>I have a similar problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to save pictures to folders in the Pictures folder but get an error message telling me I don't have permission to save to this location and to contact the administrator. When I checked the folders they all appear to be read only and if I clear
 them they revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happened after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem when trying to delete a folder. It told me I didn't have the proper permissions and that I needed to contact the administrator, however I was already signed in on an administrator account.
<br />
<br />
The fix was to take ownership of the folder. The folder didn't actually have an account assigned to it. I apologize if the steps below aren't 100%, &nbsp;I'm at my work terminal now so I can't verify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While signed in on an administrator account right&nbsp;click&nbsp;on the folder and select properties. Then go to the security tab. Select advanced, then take ownership near the top of the window click on find now. select your account name and take ownership of the
 folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried it too and also found I was already the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now discovered that I can copy to the folders but not save to them.</p>
<p>So now I am saving the pictures to my desktop where I rename them. I then copy or cut and paste&nbsp;them into the pictures folder which won't allow me to save direct.</p>
<p>This seems to work but is far from ideal.</p>
<p>Hope this is of help to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now starting to find other problems&nbsp;with Windows 10 and apparent differences between Windows 10 and Windows 7 which in my opinion are not good. Certain features seem to have completely disappeared and the way things work are different and not helpful.
 At the moment I definitely won't be upgrading my 2nd laptop to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even simple things like downloading seems to have become more difficult ...... maybe I'm missing something!!!!</p>

            I'm having exactly the same problem. &nbsp;My 3D CAD files are all in MyDocuments folder and they are all locked to Read Only mode no matter what I do. &nbsp;I sure wish I read up on the issues before I upgraded from Win7 to 10. &nbsp;looks like there is still not a

            <p>I did read up before upgrading but there was no mention of this problem so I'm assuming these are isolated cases. If it was a problem for everyone upgrading to Windows 10 Microsoft would have been inundated with complaints and this doesn't appear to be the
 case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My list of queries and problems is growing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't resolve the problem soon it looks like it's going to be an on-line session with a Microsoft support technician. Apparently it takes about 3 hours to get connected to one but the wait will be worth it if I can get some of my issues resolved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've played around with Windows 10 and LOVE most of the new options. The only thing (so far) that I use that seems to have disappeared is the screen saver! I love having photos of my kids showing on my computer when it's not in use.</p>
<p>

            <p>I had the same problem tonight and read through the replys. The ownership post above was on the right track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I decided to check out Cortana after reading about it. Well, to do that, Windows had to have me logged into a Microsoft Account. I used my hotmail account and got Cortana working... and that is when I stopped being able to save
 much or workaround being able to save. I was no longer logging in as the same user I used before. I was logging in as my hotmail account. I added that account as an owner for all my documents and it worked.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 system restore failing with 0x80070002 error</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 PC which yesterday failed to start (just hung on the Windows logo on start-up). &nbsp;I have tried several things, principally trying to do a System Restore at boot but each time the System Restore fails with the following message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Details:&nbsp;<br />
System Restore failed to replace the file<br />
(C:\ProgramData\Trusteer\Rapport\store\user\mfsm_persistent_machines_var_1.js. with its original copy from the restore point.&nbsp;<br />
An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070002)<br />
<br />
You can try System Restore again and choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try an advanced recovery method."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have tried the System Restore for multiple restore points, including the earliest available, but get the message every time. &nbsp;Has anyone any advice for the best thing to try next? &nbsp;I haven't got the full spec. to hand, but if it makes a difference this
 is a Dell laptop, originally upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any advice. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to gather more information about the problem so we can properly address it. Do you have any firewall or antivirus installed on your PC? If you do, but haven't disabled it during the system restore, then we suggest that you disable it and try
 the restore process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this won't help, try running the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/bd832f07-1420-0c14-d2a5-0a5a24ba40be/using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker in Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of the result.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply. I have tried running the System File Checker from the command prompt (after Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options, at boot). I get the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Beginning system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />

<br />

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how I can disable anti-virus or the firewall when I can't get past start-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay - it's taken a while for me to get a chance to try this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now done the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a recovery drive on another Windows 10 PC. &nbsp;</li><li>Started the problem PC using the recovery drive (using the boot menu to boot from the USB device). &nbsp;</li><li>The PC boots from the USB device with the recovery drive. &nbsp;</li><li>I get the screen to choose keyboard lay-out. &nbsp;</li><li>At the "Choose an option" screen, I choose "Troubleshoot" then "Advanced options" then "Startup Repair" then "Windows 10". &nbsp;</li><li>However, I then get the message: "This option is not supported on the operating system you've selected."&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This therefore does not take me further forward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest I try next? &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jules, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since you are unable to perform a <strong>Startup Repair</strong>, let's run a check disk on your PC. Follow the same steps on how to access
<strong>Startup Repair</strong>, but choose <strong>Command prompt</strong> instead. In the
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type <strong>chkdsk /r</strong>, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Important: While performing <strong>chkdsk</strong> on the hard drive, if there are bad sectors found on the hard drive when
<strong>chkdsk</strong> tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let us know how it goes.

</p><p>I tried this, but the app was unable to find a solution itself.So I posted my question to the community. I also tried downloading the update from the MS update repository, but the download stalled out after an hour or so, leaving me with a partially dowloaded
 (PART) file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have encountered problems installing updates on this computer. And I am no Windows expert. I only use a windows machine when I have to run a windows only-app. Otherwise I use a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The frustrating part is that there is no error code reported that I can access specifics for. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help so far.</p>

<p>Hah! I solved the problem this way: First, I had to access Microsoft's update catalog using Internet Explorer in Windows 10. To launch IE (it was not on my task bar), I had to enter the following in the "Search Windows" box: IExplore. Turns out, in Windows
 10, this is a run command. I then clicked the IExplore button to lauch the run command. I then saved IExplore on the task bar by right-clicking the IExplore symbol and selected "pin this item to taskbar" for easy access in the future. Inside IExplore, I searched
 for "Windows 10 Update Catalog" and clicked on the first hit. This brought up the Catalog's front page. Inside the search box, I entered KB4480962. This brought up two hits, one for the 32-bit (X86) operating system and the other for the 64 bit OS. To find
 out which OS I have, I went to the "Settings" entry in the Windows pane (lower left icon on the screen), Selected "System", then "About". In the MS catalog search results, I clicked on the "Download" button for the 64 bit OS.&nbsp; This brought up another window
 with a link in it, <a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/software/secu/2019/01/windows10.0-kb4480962-x64_903f1ad35b887188c55996aaf3463940685e3a54.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="windows10.0-kb4480962-x64_903f1ad35b887188c55996aaf3463940685e3a54.msu">
windows10.0-kb4480962-x64_903f1ad35b887188c55996aaf3463940685e3a54.msu .</a></p>
<p>I clicked this link (gulp) and selected the "Open" (not "Save") option. Doing so initiated the download and install of the cumulative update. After the completion of this step, I restarted my computer which finished the update. The final step was to login,
 go to Settings -&gt; Update. The old, uninformative error message reappeared. I clicked "retry", and voila, the updater reported that I was up-to-date!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that I find the the Updater is very quirky. I can't count how many hours I have wasted in the past dealing with update problems. However, for now, my system appears to be up-to-date. Hopefully, this answer will provide some guidance for others
 struggling to keep their systems up to date as well.</p>

            Hello William,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Let's do this WilliamLockman,
<br />
<br />If the download was stopped, it may be a problem connecting to the internet that caused this.
<br />Tip, try to change the network to which you connect or try to download the update from another PC and then downloaded we can proceed to install it.
<br />
<br />Let me know if it helped

            Thanks for your reply. The internet connection was fine. I solved the problem myself by manually downloading/installing the update. See my reply on this thread: "https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/failed-to-downloadinstall-january-8-2019kb4480962/5acce068-7012-483d-b08b-e62ba884763d?messageId=706b5c61-7936-4fe2-a4ce-4ed407cda825"

<h2>            System not booting after CPU change</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I upgraded my older system (socket 775). In Bios it recognizes all memory and also new CPU. It starts booting Windows 10 64bit but theres no spinning circle and HDD LED shows no activity. When i try to boot some other system like Win 7 or Win XP,
 it boots up fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried Windows Installation USB but there is same problem,... no spinning circle.</p>
<p>Can somebody please help me with this? Thanks</p>

            Hi Vladimir, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It's possible that your boot device isn't set to the right hard drive. When your PC is booting up, try pressing F12 to load your boot options, then select the drive that Windows 10 is installed on.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, a CPU change shouldn't affect your Windows 10 installation. I've recently done one myself with no issues.
<br />
<br />You could also try unplugging every unnecessary hard drive or external storage so that only the hard drive with Windows 10 is plugged, then see if it boots.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>Alredy have right one. Tried original HDD from that computer with windows 10 which works on other PCs and then one disk with windows 7. It is set up right way but not booting.</p>
<p>Tried with two and also only one hard drive but no change.</p>

            In that case, you might want to try booting to a recovery USB to repair the Windows installation on that hard drive.
<br />
<br />You'll need to use another PC to create a bootable USB drive by typing "create recovery drive" into Start, or by following the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/</a>...
<br />
<br />The USB drive needs to be empty and have at least 8GB storage space. Once you've created to bootable media, you can plug it into the computer that won't boot and set your startup boot options to USB. It'll load up the Windows Recovery Environment, and from there you can repair Windows.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go!

<h3> drdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 WON&#34;T INSTALL&#33;</h2>
                    I have tried to install windows 7 about 10 times (both 64 and 32 bit versions) on a new hard drive and it keeps erroring out at the finalizing install screen.&nbsp; I stripped my computer down to just the MB, CPU, RAM, HD, DVD, and Monitor, keyboard, mouse.&nbsp;
 Everything else was disconnected or removed.&nbsp; System specs: MB - EVGA e-7150/630i : CPU - Intel Core2 Duo E4600 : RAM - Corsair XMS2 DDR2 (4GB) : HD - WD Caviar Green 500GB SATA : DVD multi superwriter (forget brand, Samsung?).&nbsp; I tried installing on formatted
 partition, tried letting win7 make the partition, and on an unformatted partition.&nbsp; Same error every time.&nbsp; The "repair computer" function in the install disc would not work, I did let it send info to MS.&nbsp; I have installed win7 on a friend's computer with
 no problems and liked it a lot, but am giving up on it for now on mine....&nbsp; I would really like to use this new, fantastic (it seems) OS, but as far as my system is concerned it is s**t.&nbs

            Hi 2A.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here's how to change those file permissions:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/85640-set-unset-read-only-attribute-files-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/85640-set-u...</a>
<br />
<br />Be aware also that No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run a full scan with Malwarebytes free scanner: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (<strong>Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.</strong>)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.&nbsp;Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model&nbsp;of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click&nbsp;UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right&nbsp;Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers&nbsp;particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Should I install Windows 7 32-bit or 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <i>Windows 7 Professional 32bits or Windows Home Premium 64 bits</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Dell with AMD quadcore, RAM: 4G (8G MAX) &nbsp;with Windows 7 profesional 32bits. Now I recently bought a license of Windows 7 Home Premium &nbsp;64 and 32 bits ( 2 CDs) for 3 PCs. I would like to know if it is better to upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium
 64bits or keep Windows 7 profesional 32 bits.</div>

            <p>It depends on your needs.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional includes the following functionality:</p>
<p>Domain Join</p>
<p>Network Backup</p>
<p>Group Policy</p>
<p>Windows XP Mode</p>
<p>Folder Encryption</p>
<p>Location Aware Printing</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>If these features are not important to you, you can go ahead and use Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</p>
<p>If the above features are important to you, you can simply download a copy of Windows 7 Professional 64 bit and use the same product key used to activate the 32 bit version of Windows 7 Professional 32 bit:</p>
