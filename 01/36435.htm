<h2>            Ready To Install - is missing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>About 4 days ago the Ready To Install section of My Games &amp; Apps has disappeared.</p>
<p>It was last visible a couple of days before that as I purchased a USB 3.0 external HDD and started installing games to it. &nbsp;Now I can no longer see my "ready to install" games of which I have quite a few.</p>
<p>I've seen people reporting this issue back in June/July but it reappeared for them after a couple of days.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what the solution (or cause) is?</p>
<p>Andy</p>

    <title>Elite controller not charging. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pushmonk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite controller not charging.</h2>
                    
<p>I took the plug and play battery from my old controller to use in my new elite and switched out USB cables. Everything worked fine until just now. I received the notification of a low battery so I plugged it in. The low battery icon faded out from the dashboard
 and within a few minutes the low battery notification popped up again, while it was still plugged in. I unplugged the controller, and then plugged it back in. Same thing happened. I then put the old USB cable back in and tried again. Same thing happened, but
 the charge indicator light on the cable did not come on (I'm not sure if it's even supposed to, considering there isn't one on the new USB cable). Any ideas? Anyone else having this happen? The micro USB port on the controller is super snug, not sure if that's
 normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: When unplugging the cable from the controller, the Xbox button flashes, even though it is not providing power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To clarify, after you switched the battery around it started showing correctly for you? Are you still seeing any issues with this or are you all good to go now?</p>

<p>My new elite controller does not charge also. I'll charge the battery in another controller until MS fixes it I guess. I unpluged it, plugged in a regular controller, and went back and now it's charging. The firmware version is 2.3.2369.2</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue. The standard play n charge kit cable stays orange forever. The controller will charge somewhat with the braided cord that it comes with. When it shows fully charged it will show low battery after a few hours. Then I go to plug
 it in and then immediately unplug it and then it shows fully charged. It's is being weird.

<p>hypo luxa mentioned they were using the Micro USB cable that was included with the Elite Controller which provides some charge. Can everyone else please clarify that they're using this cable to charge their controller? Thanks! </p>

<p>Hi Mister Maka,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I wish the elite braided cable came with some type of visual indicator like the standard play and charge cables in the form of a orange / white light that tells the user that the battery is charged. &nbsp;It is very bizarre that the other
 4 standard controllers that I own never have given me the "battery low" notification on screen whilst the elite controller gives it to me after a few hours or even after 20-ish so minutes of gameplay. &nbsp;When I see this notification, I'll plug in the elite controller
 and then unplug it immediately or I'll even re-sync it and presto, the xbox elite controller reads full charge....and not low battery. &nbsp;Is there a firmware issue going on right now because the elite controller shipped with its most current firmware version?
 &nbsp; Seems really buggy to me....and to hear other folks having a similar issue above kindof makes me think it's not isolated. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>
        </p>

<p>.....and to add one other thing.....the first night I tried charging the battery pack with the play and charge kit black cable, it never turned white. &nbsp;It perpetually indicated orange.</p>

<p>I've been having this same problem, both old and new cable will never charge on the elite. No amount of switching will make it read the battery correctly, always red, NEVER charges. It will also not read normal AA batteries correctly. Popped in 2 brand new
 Eneloop batteries and they showed red.</p>

            <p>Hello Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance attached you'll find a video showing the steps I have taken to follow your directions and how Win 10 Simply will not let me either create a new account or sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's puzzling to me is that I AM signed into my Microsoft account (the same one as I am using for this support area) but it will not recognize that I am logged in...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this NOT an appropriate account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way Win 10 Blocks my attempts to create a new account - with the "Something Went Wrong Screen".</p>
<p>As you will see in the video. - http://screencast.com/t/Kv7WMxIQ8C</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            <p>Hello Microsoft Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have re-installed windows 10 and still have the same issue.</p>
<p>(on another machine it is working fine using the same Microsoft email account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just watched a video of all the new products from Microsoft at the end of the video
</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella</strong>&nbsp;- from Microsoft said that the goal of Microsoft is for people to be transformed from
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needing Windows</p>
<p>to - Choosing Windows</p>
<p>to Loving Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally every new product has its challenges and the roll out of Windows 10 is a massive undertaking.</p>
<p>but what I can say is right now is: &nbsp;I see the glitter - the possibilities.. and they look great and promising. But, the simple fact is that&nbsp;Windows 10 has been crippling my productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have wasted numerous hours trying to get Windows 10 to work and share content with my other machines. I am not anywhere near
<strong>Satya Nadella</strong>&nbsp;Goal of Loving Windows 10&nbsp;right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am having seems to be a simple one... I am being blocked from accessing Cortana, One Drive won't connect, and I cannot download apps, or change user accounts&nbsp;since it will not&nbsp;connect to&nbsp;create an email account or let me input my Microsoft&nbsp;Account
 info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for this is: &nbsp;Windows 10 will NOT connect because it thinks I am NOT connected to the internet... (even when I am logged into my Microsoft account on an active internet connection on the same computer).
</p>

            I suggest you go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy there for Windows 8.1, then reinstall Windows 8.1.
<br />
<br />You will need to power down, connect the USB, start the system then configure your BIOS to boot from it:

<h2>            Acer R7 webcam works fine, but &#42;only&#42; in the &#34;Camera&#34; app.</h2>
                    <p>I just bought an Acer R7 laptop with Win8.1 pre-installed, and its webcam works just fine for taking snaps and short vids with the Win 8.1 "Camera" app (so I know there's nothing wrong with the hardware)... but absolutely *nothing* that I normally use for
 editing pictures recognizes that I have a camera attached to my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not even Acer's own "Crystal Eye" app believes I have a webcam.&nbsp; The "error message" when I ask to capture a shot is always some variant of "you have no WIA camera/scanner device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really want is to be able to capture webcam shots directly into Paintshop Pro X6 and XnView (my default picture editors), the way I used to always do with every other webcam I've ever used in the past 8 years.<br />
<br />
Is there some special driver arrangement I'm supposed to set up for this thing?&nbsp;&nbsp; (If so... WHY?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!&nbsp;&nbsp; After four solid days of searching in vain for even a kernel of info about this problem, I'm getting a bit desperate.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) is the still image acquisition platform in the Windows family of operating systems starting with Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) and Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the version of Paintshop and XnView requires Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) then it would not work in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Corel%20PaintShop%20Pro%20X6&amp;vendor=Corel&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=16&amp;BreadCrumbPath=corel%20paintshop%20Pro%20X6%20&amp;LastSearchTerm=corel%2Bpaintshop%2BPro%2BX6%2B&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Corel PaintShop Pro X6 </span></a>is compatible with Windows 8.1, no information on XnView available on the compatibility center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Camera App works fine and you face the issue while using the editing software, why don’t you contact the picture editor software developer to know if it needs a special driver in order to work on Windows 8.1. Also it depends on the camera you are
 working with, it would be a wise decision to get in touch with Acer once and see what they have to say about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The webcam is not detected by Crystal eye which is a built in software for Acer laptops, we would suggest that you download and install the latest set of drivers from the manufacturer website based on the model number&nbsp; for the webcam and check if it gets
 detected.</p>

            <p>Update on the situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIA is (and has been for more than 14 years) the single most supported Microsoft still-image acquisition protocol *ever*,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/efb904c3-f365-4f9c-a918-fec0e910c5de" title="Anannya Podder">
Anannya</a>.&nbsp; It's a standard for Windows, and Win 8.1 supports it fully.&nbsp; It's running right now as a service ("automatic" is its installed default, and I've never changed that) on my Windows 8.1 computer.<br />
<br />
If you're a "support engineer", you should know this like a mantra... and the fact that you DON'T know this makes me all the less likely to buy anything from Microsoft.&nbsp; Ever.<br />
<br />
The drivers for the webcam on my computer don't support WIA or TWAIN... and it looks like that's for me to work out with the manufacturers/vendors... but if you *ever* expect credibility in the market that employs you... don't speak about what you don't know:<br />
<br />
"(if it) requires Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) then it would not work in Windows 8.1."<br />
<br />
That's simply wrong, and your job depends on getting it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust me:&nbsp; I've been using and programming computers for more than 40 years...&nbsp; I'm a retired electronics engineering technologist, and I've *written* driver code for plug-in devices that I designed and built myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WIA for a single device should be
 simple... and Windows 8.1 DOES fully support WIA, no matter your assertion to the contrary.</p>

            Just so you can't get away with calling yourself a "support engineer" any longer, I'm reporting this entire thread to Microsoft's support and HR departments.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for how this may affect you, but anything that calls itself customer support and tells lies is simply fraud, and no one should *EVER* tolerate it.<br />

    <title>Unknown Error for April 2017 Security Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bethd19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Error for April 2017 Security Update</h2>
                    <p>I've been having problems with my computer since Microsoft brought in these new "security updates". My computer had a freak out and seemed to partially revert back in time about 6 months (I have no idea why, one minute things were working fine next time
 it did this blip and nope things wouldn't work) meaning I had to uninstall and reinstall things such as my antivirus, my microsoft office package etc because the computer kept saying they didn't exist even though they were there, and when I checked the programs
 installed there are ones there that I know I deleted ages ago and it won't let me delete them again because it says the pathways don't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I had about 21 updates to go through and all of them have been successful except for the<em> Important</em> "April, 2017 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 x64-based systems (KB4015549)". I keep getting unknown error codes with the latest
 being 80246007 but I have also had 80070490.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the troubleshooting wizard and it said it fixed everything but "Windows Update Error 0x80070057 (2017-04-15-T-07_44_54P). I have not idea what these errors are or how to fix them. I have a general knowledge of computers but it is general I don't
 know the technical stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit operating system with an intel (r) celeron (r) CPU B820 @1.70GHz (if that helps anyone) The computer came with it pre-installed so I don't have discs or anything, and I know its stupid but I don't have a backup of the
 system itself just my files and documents (just one of those things you mean to do but never get round to it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? Or point me in the right direction?</p>

            <p>Hi thank you for the reply. I will try my best to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Computer was bought in November 2012</p>
<p>1b. Manufactored by Lenovo</p>
<p>1c. Win7 64-bit came preinstalled on the computer </p>
<p>1d. No</p>
<p>1e. I think I tried a reset to an earlier date when it had its freak out earlier in the week but error messages kept coming up saying things couldn't be done properly. I don't think I've ever done either of those before, not really had any problems with
 it before.</p>
<p>2. BT Virus Protect and I have Malwarebytes. I don't know when BT Virus is due to expire as my dad gets it as part of his job. Malwarebytes is due to renew in June 2017.</p>
<p>3. BT Virus Protection is McAfee but it comes through BT not the McAfee website</p>
<p>4. When my computer had its freak out BT virus protection wouldn't work and I had to use a tool off the BT website to remove it and then reinstall it.</p>
<p>5a. No I can't see any of those codes in Installed Updates</p>
<p>5b. KB3020369- yes date installed 14th May 2015 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KB3172605 - yes date installed 12th April 2017</p>
<p>6. I don't have Java installed</p>
<p>7. Yes - I updated that one earlier today.</p>
<p>8a. Internet Explorer 11 was installed on 27th November 2013</p>
<p>8b. Update Version: 11.0.9600.18282 (KB3148198)<br />
8c. Firefox <em>version 52.0.2</em> -yes (this is the browser I use)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google Chrome <em>version </em><em>57.0.2987.133</em> - yes (but there is also a note saying there were problems with an update but it states I have the most uptodate version?)</p>
<p>9. No I'm not. I have used quickclean before but only a couple of times and the Registry box isn't ticked so I don't think it touches that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again for your help</p>

<p>1. It was installed because I had it on my previous computer too. Its been installed since I got the computer. I think about three years ago it detected something which was quarantined but I can't remember to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. BT Virus Protect has been installed since I got the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Date was 12th April 2017, I don't know what caused it to freak out one minute it was working fine (I was in the middle of a game) then it restarted all on its own (no warning like you usually get with updates) and brought up the normal "Do not shut down,
 updates 1 of ?" screen you get when its updating. Then when it restarted something flashed up on the screen looked like data of somekind (in the font you get when you are given the options to start in safe mode) but I don't know what it was and then it did
 the updates thing before the normal password page loaded. I logged on as normal but things wouldn't work, programmes including my antivirus weren't working, updates said there was 21 updates waiting etc. I clicked for the updates and tried to find out what
 was wrong whilst they were loading. I eventually decided after ages of not getting anywhere and trying to do a reset from an earlier date (which it wouldn't let me) to try reinstalling and thats when I noticed loads of programs that I had deleted months ago
 were back in my programs list and I saw a lot of them were going back to 2016. I figured the the updates had done something to my computer so reinstalled everything I could to protect my computer as much as possible whilst waiting for the upates to finish.
 They all finished except for the one mentioned above. My programs worked after reinstalling, but I can't remove the programs which I deleted earlier because they don't exist anymore.</p>
<p>4. Yes at home</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8b. Okay, do you mean with internet explorer (as I never use it I don't ever think about it) or is this windows security updates as when I did the 21 updates it included several security updates; KB3156019, KB3155178, KB3142024, KB3159398, KB3161949, KB3156016,
 KB3161958, KB3150220, and KB3170455; are these no good? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Internet explorer or the security updates aren't up todate why aren't they coming up when I search for updates? Is there anywhere I can download the security updates to make my computer safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. Don't know if this is significant but I just checked my programs list and Internet explorer isn't listed there, I found it earlier by simply searching in the start menu. I haven't used it in years so don't think about it.</p>

</p><p>Neither show up in my programs so what difference would that make if they were on? Which forum should I try? How can I find out if they were on when I bought it if they don't show up programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>would it be worth simply doing a factory reset to try and fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again for all your help.</p>

<h2>            call of duty ghosts upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>On the dashboard it says i can buy call of duty ghosts off the marketplace and upgrade to the xbox one version for 10 dollars. would i then own the game on both consoles and be able to play interchangebly between the two?(competitive is still on 360 but
 i could go play casually on the one.) would my stats transfer between the two as i am switching constantly?</p>

<p>Sorry...what?!? I got my XB1 version through the upgrade and I can play MP just fine on the 360 as well. Anything you do on one platform transfers to the other. Your MP profile is kept on Activision's servers and updates accordingly. You also only need one
 Season Pass to enjoy the benefits on both platforms.</p>

<p>I never played Ghost on the 360 so I did not have to worry about it. &nbsp;They did say initially that you would not be able to go back and forth between platforms as far as the multiplayer. &nbsp;Otherwise it would be like you getting two copies of the game for the
 price of one. &nbsp;Now if they went back on that then I stand corrected but as I stated earlier I did not buy this game for 360 and just waited on Xbox One.</p>

<p>Im not going to argue with you about this. &nbsp;The OP just wanted to know if his stats and dlc for MP would transfer. &nbsp;I told him that his stats for mp would but game saves would not. &nbsp;If they are letting you go back and forth between them then great. &nbsp;What
 I stated was what multiple people that work in game retail establishments told me when I asked about the upgrade deal. Also it goes on the fact that if you have a hard copy of the 360 version then you have to trade it in to get the $10 deal. &nbsp;However, I have
 heard that if it is detected that you own Ghost for 360 through live then it will let you download the One version for $10. &nbsp;If I had bought the 360 version then I would have downloaded the upgrade version for $10 and done the trade in deal and then sold the
 unopened one to someone else for $60. &nbsp;In the end you would only end up paying $20 for a $60 game.</p>

<p>The $10 upgrade, over Live, only worked if you bought a digital copy of the game.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>For physical copies, it was basically a trade-for...where there were participating stores. I had to re-buy it for my wife's XB1, because she wanted to keep her 360 copy, to play with those of her friends that weren't buying next gen. Season pass still works
 the same, though...oh...so did her SE bonuses.</p>

<p>You can still use both platforms for multiplayer, you can transfer your MP stats over ONLY once, from there on after current stats are linked to each account and cannot be changed or 'matched' on each system. Say you prestige on the 360 version, that won't
 show up in the X1 version. Each level up on their own.</p>

 does not work when the snap-in is doing that.&nbsp; That is usually what causes us to look at it, and now, reboot before we get a BSOD.&nbsp; I have searched all over about this and KB2518298 is the only thing that comes close, but it refers to&nbsp;rdpwd.sys as the problem

There are no files in the minidump folder.&nbsp; Most of the settings that the "here" article says to enact are contradictory to our current settings and being as this is our main server, my primary goal is to avoid the BSODs at all costs because 24GB of Ram takes
 a while to dump and then reboot.&nbsp; Time we don't usually have in the middle of a work day.&nbsp; So, long story short, I don't know when I will be able to get those DMP files unless you have another idea?

You can schedule it for off peak or you can change it next time it BSOD'S.&nbsp; Either way without the DMP file we would just be guessing.<br />

<h2>            Help&#33; Glitch on reclaimer mission</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys i am experiencing an issue on halo 4 episode reclaimer.&nbsp; I get to the part where a covenent ship is supposed to be boarded, but there is no ship to board, no objectives pop up on the map to go to, and literally nothing happens, I just get to run
 around and shoot my teammates.&nbsp; I have tried:&nbsp; clearing&nbsp;the system cache, and formatting my hdd.&nbsp; no success.&nbsp; I have replayed the mission probably 5 times or more, and still nothing.&nbsp; I guess I will play live for now, but I really want to play through the
 campaign.&nbsp; Please help...</p>

                </div>

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 1720</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded Windows 7 Ultimate to Win 10 Pro on a Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop, and the display doesn't work. The upgrade loaded, and everything else seems to work on the laptop, just no screen. The laptop can't detect it's own display in the control panel,
 it will only&nbsp;detect the external monitor I have plugged in through the VGA port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphics card is the original that came on the laptop - NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a driver update that fixes this?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 &#40;32 Bit&#41; Cannot Find DVD&#47;CD Drivers for Clean - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#40;32 Bit&#41; Cannot Find DVD&#47;CD Drivers for Clean Install</h2>
                    I have been trying to install Windows 7 on a clean hard drive but have been experiencing issues.<br />
<br />
1) Installer hangs at times and loads again after i eject/insert the disc again.<br />
2) Installer cannot find drivers for dvd drive.<br />
<br />
I have found a work around for this by installing XP first then installing Windows 7.<br />
It allows me to use 7 but, my drives do not work properly. (Reading complications with DVD/CD drives)<br />
<br />
I have tried updating the firmware on the new dvd-rw/cd-rw combo drive but no luck. (LG GH22LP20)<br />
<br />
I figure windows would use generic drivers for most dvd/cd drives.<br />
<br />
I am wondering about copying the drivers from system32 folder to test for a clean install.<br />

            For a clean install, no drivers are necessary.&nbsp; You simply insert the DVD and boot straight from it.&nbsp; You will start the PC, and when the message comes up, Press Any Key to Boot from CD Drive.... hit a key, any key, even the spacebar will do.

            Yes, i know a clean install shouldn't require any drivers. But, for some reason the installer will not allow me to continue to the 'Installation Phase' without providing a driver(s).<br />
<br />
Most hardware devices can be installed without any additional drivers and windows will use the generic or the compiled drivers it has already.

<p>Hi sheppard86.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Download the file I uploaded (scheduled.xml) from here &gt; http://cid-302fc4a61ffc4465.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Scheduled.xml to your Desktop.</p>
<p>When you have done this. click on Start and type Task Scheduler in the Search Programs and Files Box.&nbsp; Task Scheduler will appear at the top of the Menu.&nbsp; Rightclick on it and choose "Run as Administrator".&nbsp; On the left hand side, click on Task Scheduler
 Library and expand the tree until you arrive at the Diagnosis folder (Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Diagnosis).&nbsp; Select the Diagnosis folder with your Mouse and look on the righthand side for Import Task.&nbsp; Click on Import Task and browser until you find scheduled.xml.&nbsp;
 Click on Open and OK.&nbsp; Job done.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>Please advise when you have downloaded the file and I will delete it from the online directory.</p>

                    Greetings.&nbsp;
<div>I can't use none of my aplications here at my computer because they do not open themselves at all... I mean they do open first but just for a few seconds and then they close automatically after only showing their logo.</div>
<div>There's a special case, when I open the Lector (for some .pdf documents) It happens the same, but instead of only closing itself, it sends a message saying "Interfaz no compatible" in spanish. Sorry for my bad english in most of the sentences but i tried
 to explain myself as far as I could. I beg for help and wish somebody can help me. Thanks.</div>

<div>I tried all the options you gave me, and so far the message box telling "Interfaz no compatible" appears no more, but my apps still don't open themselves at all. Even the Store can't open, in order to uninstall and re-install my apps :(</div>

            i have a problem with certain apps opening, displaying the name, then closing right back down. i have a windows 8 ready biostar motherboard a780l3c but when i install the amd graphics driver, it kills the audio on some of my metro apps then the app closes,
 so i can't install my video driver. i tried the 12.6 version and the 13.1 version of my amd video driver for my amd radeon 3000 motherboard graphics. does anyone know of a fix for that?<br />

            <p>I had the same problem, this is what I did.&nbsp;Try uninstalling the app(s) first, then&nbsp;reinstall it (of course with an account).&nbsp;Launch said app(s) that didn't work. While the app(s) is open,&nbsp;switch to another account, different user or simply disconnect your
 account in settings. It'll sign out, then relaunch the apps</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my case, it wasn't just one; but several apps.&nbsp; All my apps&nbsp;work now,&nbsp;hope this works for you..</p>

    <title>USB mouse not working after Windows 8.1 Update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB mouse not working after Windows 8.1 Update.</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 8.1 on Thursday and everything was fine. I moved over the weekend so I had to take my computer apart. When I was setting it up, my mouse and keyboard worked just fine. When I plugged in my Cintiq 22HD, however, my mouse abruptly stopped
 working. My keyboard still works, my Cintiq works, but my mouse does not. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers for both, I have tried multiple ports for the mouse, I have tried different mice, I have restarted, etc. I have tried unplugging
 my Cintiq also and rebooting, but still the mouse doesn't work.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many people have suggested disabling the XHCI option in the BIOS, but considering all of my other USB devices DO work (my keyboard, my printer, my speakers, etc.) I'm not sure this will work for me. Any suggestions? I need my computer for work so this
 is incredibly inconvenient...</div>

<p>You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a></p>
<p>Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p>Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check
<br />
with MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen. If needed&nbsp;you can post the minidumps
<br />
so they can be analyzed.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<strong><br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />
