<h2>            Grand Theft Auto&#58; San Andreas Remastered - FINALLY&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So a while back I download Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Orginal XBOX version) to my XBOX 360. Was fun, but as you know while playing any oringal XBOX game a lot of features of XBOX LIVE are disabled. Plus you need to know what the "white" and "black" buttons
 from the original XBOX controller are on the XBOX 360. <br />
<br />
While today they finally released GTA: San Andreas "remastered". Which takes the game and ups the graphics to 720p. Enhances the draw distance. And changes the controls to your XBOX 360.
<br />
<br />
I bought the game for under $4.00, and I have the say it was a great buy. The game looks fantastic. You now have control over all the feature of XBOX LIVE. So you can chat with your friends while playing San Andreas. The sound is much more improved.
<br />
<br />
The only downside so far.. is that the game can be a bit laggy at times. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you are thinking about getting this game, get it. You'll be glad you did. <br />
<br />
Oh and they added Achievements!</p>

<p>Is that the stone price? Or is it a deal? I want to get it, but I'm worried that the price will go up soon. I was expecting $10-15 but that's GREAT! San Andreas was the best GTA on the sixth-generation consoles.</p>

    <title>BSOD after system has been rebooted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamessharkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after system has been rebooted</h2>
                    <p>I was having troubles with BSOD for a while. My system recoveries did not work or anything else I tried. I completely rebooted my PC a few days ago to fix the problem which worked until lat night.</p>
<p>After the reboot it has happened once, which was last night. Previously (before the reboot) it was occurring most days. It seemed to be when I would not be using the PC. When I was first installing the MS updates, there were a few problems. When my PC was
 restarting, the configuration would stick at 15% for hours. This happened 2 or 3 times. I then installed them in smaller numbers and it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I would have thought the reboot would have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how to include any information that is stored on here after a BSOD crash, so if you could help me out then please do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which version of Windows operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When was the last time the feature worked fine?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message (This device is currently in use. Close any programs or windows that might be using the device and then try again) is usually the result of an application, file, open
 document, music or video file or any other application which is in use (running from the USB flash drive or external drive) when you try to remove it by clicking on the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the notification area.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error can also be caused if your anti-virus is actively monitoring/scanning the USB drive. Normally, when removing a flash drive from a USB port,<br />
Windows should stop all the read-write operations on the drive so that it can be safely removed. If not, the flash drive can be damaged or data may be lost<br />
or corrupted. However, if Windows determines a file is in use, then it may provide a message which indicates the volume cannot be stopped right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, before ejecting or disconnecting any mass storage device, make sure none of the above activities are performed on the mass storage device before ejecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temporarily disable any security software and then try to remove the hard drive safely.</p>
<p><br />
</p><b><br />
NOTE:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus<br />
software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet<br />
or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this does not help, I would suggest you to download and run the Microsoft safety Scanner. Perform a complete scan and check for any infection including the external drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to do an online scan of your computer by visiting the link mentioned below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: There is a chance of data loss if any files are infected and which may be deleted in the clean up process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and keep us posted.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 live update crashed my console 1st April update.</h2>
                    
<p>On the 1st of april i updated my console like you do any other time. But this time it downloaded and installed half way then crashed the xbox. I contacted xbox support by the online chat and went through all the processes like hard reset, unplug it for 30mins,
 detach external hard drive, detach any cables bar the power and hdmi. The xbox will not even goes as far as the dashboard, it comes straight up with a&nbsp;<span>8 4-digit code that ends in C000 - 007F. Means "needs repair. Now the girl on support said if i could
 wait a couple of days until the new patch comes out that would be great. Not great for me but hey i can do that. Well 4 days went by and still nothing, so i got onto support again and explained myself all again because they couldn't find the referance number.
 ThIs time i wanted to speak to a manager, i got this fella Steve which he told me they know about the problem, were on a minority of cases the update reformatted the main hard drive and he carried on to explain that this hard drive was what has the system
 files, dashboard ect. Hence why i get the error straight away and not the dashboard. Steve said give us a couple of days to sort the patch out. Me being me i said thats ok. So still waiting. So i called xbox in Dublin yesterday and explained myself again.
 Xbox advised me that i would have to pay for the repair because my warranty ran out December Past. The guy said he would call me back today to try and sort it out, still waiting. XBOX why should i have to pay for something that is not my fault. It was your
 update that caused my console to crash, if i had dropped it on the floor i would see past that. Steve your manager from online support has admitted that it was your fault and i have the transcript on file to prove it. I should also mention that i own a very
 inflential social media company. I have held back from blacking your name on there. But if something doesn't get done about this i will be sure that your name goes out on line for the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hello Reaper SoD,</p>
<p>The above update error code refers that the Xbox cannot download the update from Xbox Live, and does not have anything to do with the hard drive. I don't think that an update can damage the Xbox 360. You may have lost connection while downloading and installing
 the update, causing the error codes mentioned. Also if you have hard drive issues, it is not needed to get the Xbox 360 repaired, all you need to do is purchase a new hard drive.</p>

<p>Hi Heldbowl3 thanks for the reply. It makes sense on what you saying. Xbox support have previously told me that it was the update that reformatted the main hard drive. Hence why no dashboard will load or take the update from the usb. Plus if is the main
 hard drive i take it its enclosed in the case?</p>
<p>I would much try and repair it myself.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Cortana link notifications</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently had the new creative update, and decided to push notifications from my phone to my computer to cortana.</p>
<p>I allowed all the different settings on both my phone and computer,<em> but nothing happens when I get a phone notification.</em></p>
<p>I am especially interested in message notifications, as it is very important right now that I don't miss any text notifications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alyssa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why you're having issues about Cortana notifications is due to&nbsp; incorrect settings configuration. We recommend that you follow the steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4046474/cortana-control-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to properly set up Cortana on all of your devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I followed all the steps on the article. When I did this step</p>
<p>"<span>To sync your devices, open Cortana on your PC, go to&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>,
 and then turn on&nbsp;</span><strong>Send notifications and information between devices</strong><span>.
 After a few minutes, you should receive a notification on your PC asking you to confirm that your phone is a trusted device. Once it's trusted, you'll start seeing notifications on both devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do not get a notification confirming that it is a trusted device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On my laptop, I do see the phone listed under the Phones heading in settings.</span></p>
<p><span>My phone is an Honor 5X, not a windows phone, using the new microsoft launcher rather than the default
 launcher. Not sure if that is important.&nbsp;</span></p>

            I am now recieving the notifications. Not sure what happened as All settings were set as suggested, but it's working now. When I reply to a text through a PC notification, where on my phone will it show since it doesn't show through the messaging app?

<h2>            when I send a .wlmp in e-mails the recipient can&#39;t open it, even those who have windows 7.</h2>
                    I made a slide show using windows live movie maker &amp; sent it out in e-mails. No one can open it. What do I do so others get to see it? It goes out as a .wlmp or if I use HD it goes to .wmv but is to big for e-mail. I tried the E-mail button but the pictures
 were out of focus. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks, Ken S.

            <p>The .wlmp is your <u>project</u> file.&nbsp; A <u>project</u> contains no actual video, photos or music since those are still on your computer's hard disk. The project is like the recipe for building your movie and just has the names of the source files along
 with information on where you want to apply edits, etc.&nbsp; But like a recipe, you can't consume it.</p>
<p>When you want to assemble your final <u>movie</u>, that's when you use 'Save Movie' and that creates the
<u>movie</u>.&nbsp; As you discovered, a <u>movie</u>, with all the video, photos and music actually incorporated, is much bigger.&nbsp; This is the file (.wmv format)&nbsp;that you can then view on your computer (Windows Media Player) or uploaded to a sharing site (e.g.
 YouTube) or possibly emailed.</p>
<p>However, as you have noted, video takes up a lot of space and is hard to email. If you reduce the size and quality to make something fit into an email, you are going to cause things to look blurrier.</p>
<p>The best solution would be to upload your movie to a sharing site (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, SkyDrive, etc.) and then just email people the link to view it themselves. Emailing video is not a good solution except perhaps for very, very short clips.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t update after clean install</h2>
                    I recently acquired a Vista laptop that I upgraded with an SSD and Windows 7 Professional. &nbsp;After an uneventful install on a new SSD and activation, I discovered that Win7 won't update, the update console just continues to search for updates, and CPU activity
 hovers around 50%. &nbsp;I've tied several fixes from this site and others with no luck.

            <p>I am not a PC expert, but I (FINALLY) know what caused this problem and how to solve it !!&nbsp;
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But first note that this is the solution for my WINDOWS 7, 64 bit Home Premium right after a clean install.</span></em></strong>&nbsp; I don't know if this scheme will work for 32 bit systems or other Win 7s, but
 mayhap with minor alterations and some searches...??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part of Windows 7 that searches for updates would normally take 24 to 48 hours to finish its search.&nbsp; You can tell you have this problem, whilst you wait for the updater to search, by CTRL-ALT-DEL, start Task Manager, then look at PROCESSES TAB, then
 click: Show Processes From All Users.&nbsp; Look down the list until you find a SVCHOST.EXE being run by SYSTEM that is using 50% or more CPU and a huge chunk (73%) of memory.&nbsp; So, go to Windows Update in Control Panel and tell it to never look for updates.&nbsp; Then
 back to Task Manager and KILL the big fat 50% process you just found.<br />
</p>
<p>MS has produced a fix (2 KB patches) that you cannot ordinarily get to without an update.&nbsp; There is a way to download those 2 KB files, but
<strong>then</strong>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot ordinarily install them without using WUSA (the Windows Update Stand-Alone installer).&nbsp; And if you try to use it to install the fixes, WUSA will first begin another 48 hour search for updates before installing anything.&nbsp; This is a circular trap
 !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the following link to download Windows6.1-KB3102810-x64.msu</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49540</p>
<p>Use the SAVE option, DO NOT RUN IT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the following link to download Windows6.1-KB3112343-x64.msu</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50023</p>
<p>Use the SAVE option, DO NOT RUN IT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for these two files in your DOWNLOADS folder.&nbsp; Copy them to your DESKTOP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to install them, you must use the StandAlone installer, WUSA, <em><strong>BUT
</strong></em>you must FORCE IT to simply do it without searching forever.&nbsp; Here is how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, copy the following line exactly and completely:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Users\<em><strong>Edmund</strong></em>\Desktop\windows6.1-kb3102810-x64.msu" /wuforce</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start Globe;</p>
<p>Click in the Search Programs And Files box;</p>
<p>Type: RUN</p>
<p>(make sure you are running as Administrator)</p>
<p>Click on the RUN at the top, then Right Click on it, and select PASTE;</p>
<p>Change the <strong><em>Edmund </em></strong>to whatever your USER name is;</p>
<p>Hit ENTER and let it roll.&nbsp; After the install is done, then...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the following line exactly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Users\<em><strong>Edmund</strong></em>\Desktop\windows6.1-kb3112343-x64.msu" /wuforce</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start Globe;</p>
<p>Click in the Search Programs And Files box;</p>
<p>Type: RUN</p>
<p>(make sure you are running as Administrator)</p>
<p>Click on the RUN at the top, then Right Click on it, and select PASTE;</p>
<p>Change the <strong><em>Edmund </em></strong>to whatever your USER name is;</p>
<p>Hit ENTER and let it roll again.&nbsp; After that install is done, RESTART your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now be able to setup the UPDATEs in Control Panel and Search For Updates.&nbsp; Within about 10 minutes or less, you should have a huge list of KBs to download and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Files do not appear in search results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gio79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files do not appear in search results</h2>
                    I am having a problem with two files not being indexed and not showing up in searches in Windows Explorer&nbsp;(Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits).<br />
<br />
The files are two JPGs that a friend sent me over email. I saved them in a subfolder in the Picture folder and tagged them with Windows Live Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
When I search for the pictures in the Windows Live Photo Gallery, they show up immediately (I can search by file name or any of the tags). However, when I search for them from the Start Menu or from the Explorer search bar, they are invisible: if I type any
 of the tags or their file name, they do not show up, even when I am in the folder containing such files (all other files in the same folder are indexed correctly).<br />
<br />
I right cliched each file, then Properties. In the Geneal tab,&nbsp;I then clicked on Advanced and I found out that the checkbox "allow this file content to be indexed [...]" was unchecked. I checked it, rebooted, rebuilt a search index, but the files still don't
 show up.<br />
<br />
Is there some other properties I have to look at? Any workaround? Thanks

    <title>Windows Media Player corrupts the meta data of Track 1 on hundreds of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael hockstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player corrupts the meta data of Track 1 on hundreds of albums after ripping</h2>
                    <p>I am ripping CDs to WAVs on my Win 8.1 machine using Windows Media Player. When I look at the ripped files in the File Explorer, you can see that the Title column of&nbsp;every track in the folder is the name of the file
<strong>except the first track where the Title is identified as "Track 1". </strong>
Similarly, in the Contributing Artists and Album&nbsp;columns, every track has appropriate data,
<strong>except the first track, where the data is identified as Unknown</strong>. This has happened with every album that I ripped (hundreds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you view the albums in WMP you don't notice this. However, when I try to see the tracks that I ripped in the Win 8.1 Music app,
<strong>the first track is missing on every single album that I ripped</strong>. The whole point was to rip these albums so that I could listen to them on the Music app across all my devices. Now, every single album that I ripped is missing the first track
 on the&nbsp;Music app.&nbsp;I think this has something to do with the missing metadata on the first track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, WMP still "sees" the first track and correctly identifies the metadata Title, Contributing Artists and Album columns when view in WMP. And, the file plays correctly. However, with the data missing, the Music App fails to identify the track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this? Must I re-rip all these albums with a different application?</p>

            <p>Hi Michael...</p>
<p>This sometimes happens if you have not stopped autoplay when you insert the disc...typically it will be playing track 1 and won't write the data for it ...Insert your disc and when the info has appeared exit the player...re-open and it will no longer be
 in play mode - and then rip.</p>
<p>With ripped discs already affected you can simply delete track one in the wmp library (select 'delete from library and my computer) and then re-rip the one track as above...hope this is what you need.</p>
<p>Best -R</p>

            <p>It's nice to know that someone knows about this. Unfortunately, I was not using AutoPlay. I just ripped one after the other and never noticed the problem until I tried to use Music App to listen. WMP "sees" the data but neither the File Explorer nor the
 Music App, see the mentioned metadata of the&nbsp;first track of any of the ripped albums. The file exists. You can play it "manually" if selected in the file explorer. But the missing metadata prevents Music app from working.</p>

            <p>I have just had a quick look through wav. files (which are in a separate user-account) and all the metadata is there for Tr1 in 'explorer' - although I note that when checking 'properties' none of the wav. files have the full range of info that is present
 with (eg) WMA lossless.</p>
<p>Out of interest - have you tried ripping in wma lossless? It might be worth giving that a try to see if the problem persists in a different format. (make sure 'copy protect' is de-selected)<br />

            <p>I selected WAV because I thought it would be compatible with a large number of apps and devices. I didn't pick WMA lossless because, from what little I've read, it's a format that wasn't as widely embraced (but, I don't really know).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to go back and re rip all these disks, even if it were to fix a single track, I might as well get a ripper that works correctly on my machine. WMP probably works just fine for others, but, if it's not working for me, it's not useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the best audio ripper out there. It doesn't have to be free.</p>

            There are problems with wav. and metadata - the main one being that you cannot do much alteration post-ripping...and album art can't be altered easily. I suggested wma to do one cd as a trial just to see if it takes the data correctly - flac is a popular
 lossless alternative, but not fully supported by WMP at this point (although I believe it may be in Windows 10 ) - as for other programs - media monkey and music bee seem to be popular alternatives here, although I have not used either myself.<br />

<p>yes.. boots all the way to dashboard... but then I'm stuck. &nbsp;Controller won't have any effect other than to turn on console. &nbsp;It won't turn it off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>yes... have tried play and charge kit. Doesn't help... makes no difference.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help... any other ideas? &nbsp;Am thinking of simply going to BestBuy and getting a wired controller.... thinking that it is probably a controller issue.</p>

<p>Greetings, peegee dub. When did you notice this issue begin? Does re-attaching the battery pack fix the issue? In addition have you tried power cycling the console? If you have a headset attached I would recommend detaching it and trying again to pair it
 to your Xbox. Give these steps a shot and let us know how it goes. Thanks!</p>

<p>Do you actually have a original XBOX 360 Wireless controller (and not a 3rd party manufacturer's like CodeJunkies?) They informed Microsoft that there is an incompatibility issue with their 3rd party controllers and that a firmware update is required for
 the controllers to work correctly with the XBOX 360's latest dashboard update.</p>

<p>If you had the ability to use another controller if possible to see if it's just that controller (which might actually be the case) or as you suggested you can get a wired controller (that's actually what I use, it's way lighter and better for me in games
 that I play) which will fix your issue.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>Programs and Features: Uninstall unwanted Programs.</span></p>
<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<h2>            Vista error while booting&#58; 0xc00000e9 unexpected error has occurred. </h2>
                    While trying to start up my Dell laptop with Vista Home Basic installed on it, I got an error saying that the
<strong>winload.exe is missing</strong>. I ran the bcdedit commands to set the osdevice and device partitions. While trying to boot again, got an error again this time saying that
<strong>Kernel is missing or corrupt</strong>. I tried to run a repair using the Vista installation cd but the repair failed midway. I tried to do a clean reinstall on the machine which completed successfully. But when I tried to boot the machine again, it
 gave an error&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>0xc00000e9 unexpected error has occurred</strong> with no other options. Running repair and reinstallation again did not work. I see that a lot of people have faced this problem but I could not find any solution which would work for
 me. Any clue about how to solve this and what is the cause of this problem?&nbsp;

 machine tries to restart while in the process of reinstalling, but hangs up while trying to boot the OS for almost 30 mins or so. I didn't wait for longer since it seemed unlikely that it would take more than 30 mins to start again.&nbsp;

                    I can't refresh PC or create recovery disc. It keeps on coming up with error message "Couldn't find necessary files" and telling me to insert recovery media. There are no system restore points, and I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro from Windows 7 without a disc,
 so I can't do anything. Help! Strangely, nusrmgr.cpl has disappeared, although I'd seen the shortcut just a few weeks ago (no, I didn't delete it).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely try and help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Why are you trying to refresh the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you facing any issues with Windows 8?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How many accounts are configured in the computer?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may run the System File Checker (SFC) scan. This will replace any corrupt Windows files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Boot to the
<b>desktop view</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open
<b>command prompt</b>, right click in the <b>
left corner</b> when the <b>Start window</b>appear and select <b>
command prompt (admin)</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><b><span>sfc /scannow</span></b></p>
<p><span>The
<b>sfc /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new user</a> account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists you will need the Windows 8 installation DVD to perform the repair. If you download the Windows 8 installation files, check your email, there
 should be a link to download an ISO file. Download and burn the file to a DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the DVD to perform the repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Will Not Sync &#34;Not Synced Yet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched this thread and completed everything that has been asked by previous people and even some Microsoft support people however the issue remains and Microsoft hasn't responded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue after the upgrade is the mail application will not sync and provides a "Not synced yet" status.&nbsp; No error messages in the app or in the Windows Log.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to change to a local account, remove the mail account and then switch back to a Microsoft account and still doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the SFC /SCANNOW and it completed 100% with "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the available Windows updates and still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the App Troubleshooter which a Microsoft Support person posted however it is not meant for Windows 10. http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab&nbsp;so I can't try that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now the Windows Mail App does not work and there are no other troubleshooting steps left via this forum... Microsoft we need some help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thanks for the reply, appreciate it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access my email via outlook.com no problem there.&nbsp; I've had access to email even in Windows 8.1 prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I meet all those requirements as listed and other applications (including the Calendar application) works just fine.&nbsp; I see my Outlook calendar items as booked via my Outlook.com email address which is tied to my @gmail.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly I ran the Troubleshooter for Windows App (thanks for providing the proper link unlike the previous MS tech in another forum).&nbsp; It came back saying "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".&nbsp; So for now seems like these options have not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what else to try.</p>
<p>

            I had this same problem after installing Office 2016. I finally figured out the shortcut I had on my taskbar was to Mail 2015. I deleted this shortcut, and left clicked on the windows icon in the left bottom, selected all apps, found mail 2016, and added
 it to my taskbar. Then&nbsp;it all worked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>What taskbar? This is about the Mail app. &nbsp;I have only the All Apps menu and it says, "Mail."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to be judgemental but in Windows 10, Mail is the hardest ting I've ever done on a computer and I still haven't succeeded. &nbsp;I've been doing email since the early 1990's, by the way and I have a home network of about a dozen assorted devices on my router,
 including printers, Chromecast, a Blu-ray player and six computers.</p>

            <p>I have been beating on this problem for hours. &nbsp;Five minutes ago, I went to the microsoft.com site and downloaded Windows Live Mail 2011. &nbsp;It installed in a couple of minutes, the delay coming from needing the .Net download, first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[NOTE: The download step may not be required for you. &nbsp;My version of Windows 10 actually includes some Windows Live components, including Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I cannot vouch for their completeness or functionality. &nbsp;I'm just happy for having made the download
 and having it work right almost instantaneously.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>It nicely loaded my inbox with all the mail that was on the server, EXACTLY AS DESIRED !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hideous thing that contaminates Windows 10, masquerading as an email program, might never bother me, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow in my footsteps, you may wish to uncheck the other components of Windows Live that will be offered to you. &nbsp;Getting them might not hurt but no telling of conflicts with other programs.</p>
