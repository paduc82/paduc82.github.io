<h3> scuba4mom  say:</h3>
<h2>            wininet.dll</h2>
                    
<p>I did a system restore, back a few weeks,&nbsp; on my laptop because of a problem I was having with AVG. I had nor had any problems before talking the 2011 update for AVG. After the system restore I now get&nbsp; 'explorer unable to locate component' 'application
 failed to start because WININET.dll was not found"</p>
<p>The result is that I don't have task bar so I can't undo the system restore I did and I don't have&nbsp; desktop icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there a way to undo the restore I did? or repair the WININET.dll I really need help. In plain English as I am not a tech.</p>
<p>you can email me directly at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>wesley.chin, I do not understand your post at all.&nbsp; Now in your profile, you sound like a nice guy with a good, compassionate heart, but I don't get this at all.<br />
<br />
If you were to boot your system into the XP Recovery Console and delete your wininet.dll file on purpose, then reboot you would see the problem that scuba4mom has.<br />
<br />
Then if you were to follow your directions and boot into Safe Mode with networking, things would look even worse since there will now not even be a background image (wallpaper).&nbsp; That is even scarier when all you see is an empty black screen with "Safe Mode"
 showing in all four corners.<br />
<br />
The problem is that if the wininet.dll file is missing, Explorer will not start.&nbsp; The system can still be fixed though.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested, you will not start Explorer from Task Manager either.<br />
<br />
If Explorer will not start, you need to come up with some better instructions on how to get on the Internet and download some unknown wininet.dll<br />
file from some third party site and install it on your system.&nbsp; Safe Mode with Networking is not it.&nbsp; How would you do it?<br />
<br />
Remember...&nbsp; if Explorer is not running, there are no desktop icons and no Start button - just the background image (wallpaper).<br />
<br />
You could still get in the Internet without your Explorer running though and download that ZIP file from that site with the wininet.dll file in it, but you would not get far after that - no, I'm afraid you would not get far at all without Explorer running.&nbsp;
 Try it.<br />
<br />
Next, let's say by some magic you were to actually download that wininet.dll file from the site you recommend and take a look at it, you will see that it is not a Windows XP SP3 version of the file.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I don't even know what version it is
 and am not going to figure it out, but I did actually try it anyway to see how it works.<br />
<br />
If you then follow your directions and install the downloaded file into the c:\windows\system32 folder and reboot, you will end up with just a flashing<br />
desktop which is now a totally different problem... so somehow that is just not what we need here for this issue.<br />
<br />
There is also no need to download any files from the Internet.&nbsp; There are good copies of the wininet.dll file in other places on the system so you should use them to just cop and replace the missing file and not download some unknown files from some Internet
 site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can replace the missing file by using Task Manager.<br />
<br />
If you have never seen the problem before, before jumping in to post a reply with a helpful effort, at least try to recreate the problem on your own system so you can actually see it.<br />
<br />
If you think you have an idea how to fix the problem, apply your idea to your own system first and at least be sure it works on your system.<br />
<br />
Then when you figure out how to fix the problem, post up those instructions.</p>
<p>So your first idea will not help, so do you have another idea that will help?</p>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, 64 bit -- Improper shutdown instead of sleep</h2>
                    Sometimes, instead of going into sleep mode, the computer does an improper shutdown and produces a blue screen diagnostic.<br />

On reboot, the following is displayed:<br />

You're using a NETGEAR WNDA3100v2 wireless USB network adapter - Win7 doesn't like these devices.&nbsp; Here's my rant about these devices:<br />
<blockquote>I do not recommend using wireless USB devices.&nbsp; Especially in Win7 systems.&nbsp;
<br />
These wireless USB devices have many issues with Win7 - and using Vista drivers with them is almost sure to cause a BSOD.&nbsp;
<br />
Should you want to keep using these devices, be sure to have Win7 drivers - <u><b>DO NOT use Vista drivers!!!</b></u><br />
An installable wireless PCI/PCIe card that's plugged into your motherboard is much more robust, reliable, and powerful.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
You have 6 hard drives listed on your system - what is the make/model/wattage of your Power Supply?<br />
<br />
The MSINFO32 file shows 2 BSOD's in scmndisp.sys.&nbsp; This is a driver associated with your NETGEAR WNDA3100v2 wireless USB network device.&nbsp; Please:<br />
- uninstall the NETGEAR WNDA3100v2 wireless USB network device software - and then physically remove it from your system.<br />
- either use a long wire, or move the system nearer to the router in order to have internet while testing.<br />
- monitor the system to see if that fixes the BSOD's<br />
<br />
If it does stop the BSOD's and you choose to continue to use this device, then update it's&nbsp; software to the latest available, Win7 compatible version available from the NETGEAR website.&nbsp; Install it and see if that causes further BSOD's

            Thanks for the tip on Netgear.&nbsp; I will update the driver.<br />
<br />
I think that I have localized the problem.&nbsp; I've been using thebackup program EASEUS todo 5.0.&nbsp; This program allows the user to do a full backup weekly and increments daily.&nbsp; That works fine.
<br />
<br />
It also allows the user to do a full backup daily with increments throughout the day.&nbsp; I've been using two or three hour increments.&nbsp; This part of the program is erratic.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Both parts bring the computer from sleep and back to sleep.<br />
<br />
So, I've paused the part that does hourly increments and I haven't had a shut down since doing that 5 days ago.&nbsp; I've got the EASEUS tech support working on the problem.<br />

<p>Make sure you have turned it on in Settings&gt;Personalization&gt;start&gt;Show mostly used apps.</p>
<p>I don't think there is way to manually customize start</p>

            <p>Microsoft is stupid as ****. People lambast Win8, MOSTLY because they did away with the extreme usefulness of the start menu. Then, in Win 10 previews, they bring back Win 7-type functionality back to the left side of the menu. Then further along in the
 preview they remove it again for something unknown damn reason, and then upon release you can't do ONE SINGLE USEFUL THING with the left side of the menu. It's useless. Completely useless. No more expanding of recent sites for RDP, no more expanding of recently
 opened documents for pinned programs, N O T H I N G. The only thing the left side of the start menu is for is automagically generated lists of recent/most used (which is selective and NOT actually your most used apps), etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD. WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH MICROSOFT? GIVE US OUR DAMN START MENU FUNCTIONALITY BACK. I hate you so much. You have a good product (7), bury it into the ground with the worst design decisions ever (a full screen start menu, in
 8) then promise to fix what you broke (10), but DON'T.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annnnnd....this is why so many people refuse to upgrade past 7, even though 10 was free. Congrats.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Which are the latest updates that are installed on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To check for the latest update follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>See which Windows updates are installed</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check if the drive is listed in Disk Management. To check in Disk Management, follow the steps given below.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>Open Computer Management by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Security</strong>, clicking <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>, and then double-clicking
<strong>Computer Management</strong>.‌&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span>
</li><li><span><span><span>In the left pane, under
<strong>Storage</strong>, click <strong>Disk Management</strong>, and then look for the new drive.</span></span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the drive is listed try to access the same by right clicking on the drive and selecting Open.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If there is any allocated space and there is no drive letter assigned for the same then you may go ahead and assign a drive letter
 by following the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also r<span>efer to the link and look for the suggestion given by user ‘Vincenzo Di Ruzzo’ on how to remove malware

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help but I think I have managed to resolve the problem. It seems the steps required are a little different in Windows 10 to earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I followed (this is pasted from another Microsoft forum):</p>
<p>
1. Right click an affected folder.&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Properties.&nbsp;<br />
3. Click the Security tab<br />
4. Click the "Advanced" button.<br />
5. Click "Change" next to Owner.&nbsp;<br />
6. Type your username, click the "Check Names" button, then click OK.<br />
7. Check "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects" under the owner's name.<br />
8. Click OK again. If you get a message saying "Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you full control?", click "Yes" and you're done.&nbsp;<br />
9. Click the "Edit" button.<br />
10. Click on your username from the list.<br />
11. Check "Full control" underneath it.&nbsp;<br />
12. Click OK.&nbsp;<br />
13. Click OK again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Repeat with all of the problematic folders.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing this post because I have a complain about what I presume is Update KB3045999. So far I'm not having problems with the update per se... but the way in which Windows Update handled it PISSED ME OFF!!!
</p>
<p>See, on May 13, 2015 I received a couple of prompts to restart the computer in order to install the Update in question. I postponed both because I need to keep the computer on in order to do work towards my Finals Week in college. Next thing I know, my screen
 briefly flickers and freezes, all of my opened applications (like 3 of them) suddenly close and roughly one minute later my computer shuts down and restarts. At first I feared some malware or hacking attempt was to blame... but then I realized it was Windows
 Update fault!</p>
<p>Seriously! I have never seen Windows Update force a restart down my PC's throat so thoroughly and unexpectedly! I need to do what to do so that this doesn't happen again... NEVER, EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for your Time!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Bamboo Ink paired but not writing on surface pro 4 with win 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support Team!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I have a Surface Pro 4 using Windows 10 and a Bamboo Ink pen.</p>
<p>Since a while, the pen does not work anymore. I can switch it on using the top button on it. I can pair it and in Bluetooth, it is shown as paired. If I press the top button (once or twice), it works as expected but my side buttons don't work and doesn't
 do anything if I try to write or draw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the possible solutions I found on Google (unpair and pair it again in Bluetooth settings; reinstall bluetooth and pen drivers - actually, I removed and reinstalled all drivers within Firmware, Bluetooth and Human Interface Device -; Troubleshoot;
 constantly updating everything the update manager finds, ...), but nothing solved the problem.</p>
<p>I also checked on wacom.com if there is a new driver, but when I looked for Bamboo Ink, it returns a 404 error (like if it was removed or is unsupported since a while...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? How can this problem be solved? I literally tried everything I could find on the internet but nothing solved the issue. PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gergo</p>

<p>I can not do it because - as I wrote it - the side buttons simply don't do anything. Is it possible somehow to set the compatibility mode "manually", on the PC?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF no longer working error 0x800F0922 &#40;win 10 pro build 14393&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Microsoft Print to PDF was working fine on Windows 10 for a long time, now suddenly it stopped working.&nbsp;</strong> I followed some of the recommended steps including removing it and re-adding it using turn windows features on and off.&nbsp; Now it will
 not come back via all methods, all with similar errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did sfc, tried all the printer and system troubleshooters and they don't work, so please don't respond with run sfc /scannow as I have done that several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding it back from Add Printer in devices and printers, by checking it in Turn Windows Features on and Off, and by using dism from an elevated command prompt.&nbsp; All fail and the underlying error code is always 0x800F0922</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked hours and hours trying to fix this and I am at the point at doing a fresh install and re-installing all my apps, which will take many many hours so I am not happy about that.&nbsp; Everything else works fine, including normal printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I try to install other 3rd party pdf printers, they fail to install also, sometimes with the same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things I read seem to indicate 0x800F0922 is .NET related, so I have tried to reinstall .NET and tried various .NET checker utilities and all those say that all versions of .NET I have installed are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I checked permissions of temp folders and they seem to be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the specific errors from each of the methods I used to try to turn Microsoft Print to PDF back on:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Via "add printer method"</strong><br />
<br />

    <title>Local files are read-only even if I&#39;m administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwin.xi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Local files are read-only even if I&#39;m administrator</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgrade my system from XP to Windows 7. Now if I open a file, such as .xls, .doc, .txt and others, no matter in my local driver or remote driver or external disk, it is read-only. If I save as the read-only file to a new file, I can open it properly
 in future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I examined the property of the file. The check box read-only is not checked. In tab security, I find three "group or user", which are SYSTEM, Administrators and Users, for files that opened read-only. But in property of the file I saved as, there is one
 more user - Edwin, which is my current user.</p>
<p>The group Administrators has full control to the file. So is my current user Edwin, because it is the owner of the file. But group Users can only read and execute the file.</p>
<p>The problem is, my current user Edwin is in group Administrators. In MMC, it says my user Edwin belongs to Administrators. In Control Panel - ... - User Account, my user Edwin is an administrator. It means I should have the privilege of group Administrators
 and able to full control the files. Even if I check my privilege in File Property - Security - Advanced - Effective Rights (the last tab), it says I have full control to the file. But when I open it, it is still read only.</p>
<p>I want to know what I can do. Please help me. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            SmartScreen Filter - How To Resolve A False Report&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am a webmaster and have been alerted by a user that our website is being reported as "unsafe" by the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>I have reviewed the FAQ's but I am unable to find a link to the form being referred to that allows you to report a false positive. It gives directions from a user's perspective when the error is displayed but I would like to report and work to resolve any
 issues that may have been reported and/or confirmed.</p>
<p>So please can someone point me to the area where I can have this issue resolved by MS?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance for your time.</p>

            I only have one DMP file in my Minidump folder, even though it has crashed a few times already. Does this mean I need to wait until I get the next BSOD in order to send you two DMP files?

It is beginning to look like memory<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
<div><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</span></em><br />
<br />
If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent<br />
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest.</strong><br />
Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. Get it<span>&nbsp;</span><b><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></b><br />
Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.</div>
<div><br />
<div><font color="#FF0000"><b>You can read more about running memtest</b></font><span>&nbsp;</span><b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/bsod-memory-problems-test-easily-and-completely/21c3f63f-f570-4522-b2ef-ecc7b7ff6461">here</a></b><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
2-Driver verifier</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.</span></em><br />
<br />
But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next" (or&nbsp; Type "verifier /standard /all"&nbsp; (no quotes) if you want to verify all of them (this will slow your computer down))</div>
<div>Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and for win 8 dont check Concurrency stress test, and DDI compliance checking click "Next"<br />
Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.<br />
Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least
 36 hours of continuous operation.<br />
If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />

            <p>Thanks. I am a little perplexed now...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run memtest, and on the first pass it found faults. I then removed one of the RAM stick and ran it again. This time, after running memtest for 6 passes it found nothing. I then moved the remaining memory stick into the empty slot which had been vacated
 by the previous stick. I then ran memtest again, and once again, after 6 passes it came up with nothing. So I thought "great it must be the stick, not the slot." But just to be sure I decided to re-run the first stick that I had removed that I thought was
 faulty. This time after 6 passes it came up with nothing. I then returned the other stick (the one I thought was good), and re-ran memtest for 6 passes with both sticks in. This time memtest came up with nothing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal? Could it be that the card was maybe not sitting right or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not run the verifier test yet. Should I?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

It does sound inconsistent.&nbsp; I would forget about memtest for the moment and move to verifier.&nbsp; If it is in fact memory verifier will give us some clues to that fact, and if not it will tell us the driver that is giving you grief.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>By performing clean boot you can check if the problem is caused due to some third party program running in the back ground.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you have not done clean boot, try performing clean boot and then check if the same issue occurs.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you have performed clean boot, then what is the result.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Devices and Printers Screen</h2>
                    On the Windows 10 Devices and Printers Screen there is a line above devices that says "Windows can display enhanced device icons and information from the Internet. Click to change." I inadvertently clicked it and it disappeared. What does this mean and
 how do I reset the page to default and get the line back?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You're getting the message "Windows can display enhanced device icons and information from the Internet. Click to change" because Windows wants to know if you want to use the Internet to get a nice icon. To reset the page of the devices and printers screen
 to default, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Go to <strong>Hardware </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Sound</strong>.<br />
3. Then, <strong>Devices </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Printers</strong>.<br />
4. Under <strong>Devices </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Printers</strong>, right-click the icon for system unit.<br />
5. Select <strong>Device </strong><strong>installation </strong><strong>settings</strong>.<br />
6. Once the Windows for the <strong>Device </strong><strong>installation </strong>
<strong>settings </strong>pop-up, you have to click <strong>No </strong>if you want to have the default devices and printers settings.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.<br />

<h2>            Network Adapter error code 45.</h2>
                    <p>OT: Code 45 on tablet..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I have a Lenovo Miix 2 tablet/laptop. I got it about a month ago now all oft he sudden I lost my wireless connection and no networks will even show up. I reinstalled all of the necessary drivers for my network adapter and it still won't connect. It says
 that the adapter is not connected (hence code 45) but this is a tablet so I have no way of reconnecting it if it really is.... Is this a software issue that can be resolved or is it really a hardware issue?

<h3> lumbergumrubber  say:</h3>
<h2>            hovering mouse over icons does not ....</h2>
                    <p>In Tools / Internet Options / Tabs, I have preview tabs checked off. Also, right clicking on Taskbar / Properties, I have Use Peek to Preview checked off. Here's what's unique. Suddenly I can hover the mouse over open programs, such as IE10. The preview
 will show how many&nbsp; tabs I have opened. But if I click on one of the tabs and then go back and hover the mouse over the IE icon, the preview will not show up. If I click on it, it will but otherwise after clicking on any particular tab, it won't. Maybe a reboot
 (haven't done that) but is there something else that I'm missing that you folks could point out. Thanks.
