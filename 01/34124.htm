<h2>            Lenovo G50-80 stopped working after window 10 upgrade</h2>
                    I have a lenovo G50-80 laptop with windows 8. I upgraded to windows 10, it was working fine for the first 2 days.. I shut it off and a couple weeks went by. &nbsp;When I turned it on, it did nothing. The battery indicator light was white and would blink once
 every couple seconds. I hit the enter button and the lenovo screen came on and it said something about starting to repair then the screen goes black. It will not do anything else.

    <title>No offline mode &#40;Skype won&#39;t allow me to sign out&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jokerjoke  say:</h3>
<h2>            No offline mode &#40;Skype won&#39;t allow me to sign out&#41; Contacts think I am AWAY</h2>
                    <p>Why has Skype removed the ability to go completely go offline?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign out completely, Skype sets my status to AWAY mode. Contacts think I am away for days at a time, not responding to their messages/ignoring them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround is to switch to INVISABLE&nbsp;mode, which then sets my status to OFFLINE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, explain why I am being FORCED to stay signed us under the INVISIBLE&nbsp;feature, just so my contacts know I am offline, which clearly I am NOT in that instance, which also means when my contacts attempt to call me or send messages, I am alerted simply becuaseI
 am in invisible mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even believe the developers are doing this Skype, it's utterly awful now.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I signout ocmpletely&nbsp;and stop Skype from showing me as "away". Is deleting my account the only way to stop this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the older version Desktop and Mac and it's the same thing. I've tried removing the app from my phone. Nothing works.&nbsp;</p>

            Are you signed through multiple devices such as phone? In general, the reason for this is that you are signed in through phone where you have Skype and internet is always running. This keeps you logged in all the time.

<p>No, I am signed out on my iphone. I was actually signed into my backup account for testing purposes. I have since deleted the app from my phone, and restarted it. I also removed all traces of Skype from both my win10 desktop and my mac and did a clean install
 of different versions (also for testing) and it's the same problem. There is no way for me to sign out without appearing "away" to my contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I toggle signed out, it shows me as "away" and the last time I was seen. When I switch to invisible I appear offline to contacts. All I want to do is sign out, close Skype and have my status show me as offline/offline with video messaging, which
 is what I technically&nbsp;am. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm signed out, I'm not just simply away from my desk and can respond later, I need my contacts to know I am offline and shouldn't expect a response&nbsp;until I am online and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sit in invisible&nbsp;mode all day while having chat windows pop up or unwanted calls all night long, and what happens when I turn off my computer, will my status go back to away mode? This is a nightmare!&nbsp;</p>

            I just signed out and uninstalled Skype from everywhere Desktop/Mac/iPhone, deleted all registry entries on Windows, and all folders on Mac. Guess what, my friend said I am still showing as&nbsp;away&nbsp;in her contacts. I had her remove me, add me back, reboot
 her computer and I'm still showing as away. Skype is dead!&nbsp;

<p>I'm trying to find information on signing up for the XBOX ambassador program. I have been gaming for 32 years and want to become more active in the XBOX community. I am a skilled trades union electrician and hold 2 college degrees. I love helping friends
 with getting around the XBOX live menus, and aiding them with any questions they might have regarding a particular game. I am a member of &nbsp;<strong>[MOD EDIT]</strong>&nbsp;and enjoy meeting new friends who play competitively, who also play for the&nbsp;experience and
 fun as well. I am familiar with all genres of video games and even know about the technical aspects of games such as polygons per second, anti-aliasing, cell shading, frame rates, and so on. I have been around since the days of Atari, Colecovision, and Intellivision.....witnessing
 and playing all these wonderful systems which have led to great consoles such as the XBOX 360. If anyone could please message me back, or help me in finding out exactly what I need to do to become an XBOX ambassador...please message me back. As mentioned earlier,
 whether it's turning laps in Forza, running and gunning in Call of Duty, or strolling through Skyrim for a majical adventure...I can be of help to those who enjoy great games and have questions. Oh yeah, isn't it exciting......Boarderlands II, Halo 4, Forza
 Horizon, and Black Ops II....man, what a fall line up. Looks like it's going to be "Prime Time" playing on XBOX Live. Oh, one more thing...I have three children who are ages 14,13, and 13. They love Major Nelson and wanted me to ask for a picture with his
 autograpgh! My gamertag is Techno Fabulous.</p>

<p>Here you go:</p>

<li>Create a bootable repair flash disk on some other Windows 10 machine, using the command RecoveryDrive.exe. Do NOT copy the system files.</li><li>Use this disk to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode.</li><li>Use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before you painted yourself into a corner.</li><li>Plan ahead and create, test and document a spare admin account. Having a single admin account is as risky as having a single house key, and for much the same reasons.</li></ol>

 issue, why doesn't Microsoft just create a link to the proper codec? &nbsp;I can't figure it out. &nbsp;They suggest that it might be a codec issue, but then warn you about downloading codecs from the internet. &nbsp;Please provide a solution.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick explanation as to why the two machines are different...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgrade from Win 7, Windows 8, 8.1, and 10&nbsp;retain all of the Codecs from WMP
<strong>and</strong> Media Center... WMP actually gets a good number of it's codecs from Media Center... in particular .mpeg...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not have Media Center so the codecs are missing... In addition, .mpeg is considered a type of DVD format, and Win 10 will not play any type of DVD' format with WMP anymore...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running a build of Win 10 that was not an upgrade of Win 7, I either need to use a 3rd party player for .mpeg, or install 3rd party codecs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>VLC Media Player is a good, free player for about anything... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Player Classic-Home Cinema also works well and is also free... The writers of this player also have codecs available separately that will enable WMP to play about anything... Except for DVD's...</p>
<p>
</p><p>They even list a download link for their competitor... VLC Media Player...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used this codec package for a good number of years without any sign of any type of improper snooping... I use the "Basic" package</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the install of the codec package, there is one window that will install an additional program that you wouldn't want, but they are honest enough to make it an optional thing if you are paying attention...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that from my own personal experience with this issue since the introduction of Windows 8, these are about your only options, other than some other 3rd party codec supplier...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see a "321" emblem on their website... I have been using stuff from these people for 15 years if that means anything...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... here's a link to take a look at... <a href="https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

On this Microsoft website, you will find only one answer and nothing is adressed. What I mean is you can select multiple files/folders-press control with yourvnormal select button.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, my stuff gets copied/recopied</p>
<p>How can you select multiple files without watching Microsoft re copy them?</p>

            <p>Personally I believe people may have their Mouse to sensitive,</p>
<p>Or just don't realize that when they click on a file the mouse Moves slightly thus creating the copies of the already selected files,</p>
<p>You can try this,</p>
<p>Select a file, then scroll to the last file and hold down the Shift key and click on the last,</p>
<p>This will select all of the files between the clicks,</p>
<p>I use&nbsp;Single click to open an item and Point to select&nbsp;and have never had an issue like people describe.</p>
<p>Although if your holding down the Ctrl key and you use the Mouse wheel to scroll down the page Copies will also be created :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
If I've already set privacy and disk space options in my browser, do I need to do it again?
<p>You may be aware that some websites work together with your browser to store small amounts of data, called cookies, on your computer for their own use in the future. For example, when you go to a website regularly, it may welcome you by name; your name is
 probably stored in a cookie, and you can use browser options to determine whether you want cookies or not. You may also have specified in your browser that pages you visit can take up only a certain amount of disk space.</p>
<p>When SWF or FLV content is being played, the settings you select for Flash Player are used in place of options you may have set in your browser. That is, even if you have specified in your browser settings that you do not want cookies placed on your computer,
 you may be asked if an application that runs in Flash Player can store information. This happens because the information stored by Flash Player is not the same as a cookie; it is used only by the application and has no relation to any other Internet privacy
 or security settings you may have set in your browser.</p>
<p>Similarly, the amount of disk space you let the application use has no relation to the amount of disk space you have allotted for stored pages in your browser. That is, when SWF or FLV content is being played, the amount of disk space you allow here is in
 addition to any space your browser is using for stored pages.</p>
<p>No matter how you may have configured your browser, you still have the option to allow or deny the application that runs in Flash Player permission to store the information and to specify how much disk space the stored information can occupy.</p>

<h2>            My computer keeps freezing...do I need a new hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My windows 7 computer will keep randomly freezing on just about any program you can name (microsoft word, mozilla, ie, online games, itunes, etc.)<br />
I have done multiple things but I have ran out of options...they include:<br />
- Anti virus scans<br />
- Defrag<br />
- Uninstall of programs and reinstall<br />
- Ran memtest and it was fine<br />
- Ran hard drive test when startup computer in start menu and it was fine<br />
- Ran chkdsk and it was fine<br />
- did some reg cleaner thing for free and it got rid of a lot of stuff but hasn't really seemed to help<br />
- ran some program from fujitsu (company of my hard drive) and a short test came back fine but a long test failed after 45 min.
<br />
<br />
I think I need a new hard drive but is there anything else I can check or do before I get one?<br />

            I did run speccy a while ago and hence I figured out it was a fujitsu. <br />
<br />
I already did make some copy of a bootable cd and it worked just fine. <br />
I will run the sfc&nbsp;&nbsp; / scannow command and report what happens. <br />
<br />
Note: As I have typed this my computer froze up completely and I couldn't even move the mouse while mozilla went non-responsive.

            Running the scan found nothing wrong...<br />
<br />
and now my display driver keeps failing and my screen gets ridiculously bright so I have to fix that and my internet keeps having limited connectivity so I have to have windows diagnose and fix the problem to load my internet sometimes. Grrrrrr.<br />

<p>Your index requires virtually no maintenance. However, if the index has problems finding files that you know should be located in an indexed location, you might need to rebuild the index. This can take a long time to complete, so avoid performing
 this step unless you have given the index enough time (several hours) to correct any problems first. To rebuild the index:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Indexing and Search Options by clicking the

 clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Maintenance</span>, and then clicking
<span>Indexing Options</span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Advanced</span>, click the <span>
Index Settings</span> tab, and then click <span>Rebuild</span>. <span>

 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />The Safety Scanner should eliminate this malware detection: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Trojan%3aWin32%2fDynamer!ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threa...</a>
<br />
<br /> The best way to avoid the false detection is to not scan the computer with MS antimalware programs. 
<br />
<br />Or if you prefer to do so you can remove/delete the partition: <a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating-System-and-Recovery/Recovery-after-potential-trojan-on-recovery-partition/td-p/5487655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating...</a>
<br />
<br />Or - you can also try the following free removal guide from Malwaretips.com: <a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dynamer-ac-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dyna...</a>

            <p>Big tip:&nbsp; Do not accept any driver updates from Windows Update.&nbsp; If you see a windows update for a driver, right-click on it and choose Hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Windows Update.&nbsp; Search for Updates.&nbsp; When that is done, find the update that is causing this problem, right-click on it and choose Hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers should only be updated to solve a problem.&nbsp; There are two places and only two you should ever accept a diver from:&nbsp; the manufacturer/brand name of your computer's support web site, or Intel's driver update program.</p>

            <p>More info (be glad):</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/203e6f43-a321-4767-ac89-8dce69d6cb04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/203e6f43-a321-4767-ac89-8dce69d6cb04" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (network, audio, video) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware manufacturers
 WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with video, audio or network don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates
 from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd5f125e-5d6b-4be6-8bb0-984bb7214630" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35df6133-2810-4d2f-aacc-931b3ef61f78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35df6133-2810-4d2f-aacc-931b3ef61f78" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<h2>            Wireless Zero Configuration Difficulties</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had a new mother board installed in my laptop - since then I am unable to connect automatically to my wireless network.&nbsp; Each time I wish to so, I have to go through the following procedure: Go to admin tools; then services; then wireless zero
 configuration; then under general tab set service status to start; click ok; then go to network connections; right click on properties; then wireless networks; then check use windows to configure wireless network setting, then click ok.&nbsp; Could someone tell
 me what I need to do in order that my laptop connects automatically to the wireless network as it used to! :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

Unfortunately, the solutions only apply to Windows Explorer, and the similar processes.

<span>&nbsp;</span>The registry key path often provided even includes the limitation for “Explorer” only:

<p><span>What we really need is a means to disable the “tool-tip” boxes/banners in other applications, such as IE, Outlook, other MS
 Office programs and non-Microsoft programs. </span></p>

            Actually, recommended best way to transfer ownership of a used computer is to do a clean install of Windows. 
<br />
<br />This wipes out all traces of your past existence. And it wipes out any malware you may have lurking in the background. 
<br />
<br />Then you can install only the applications she needs. That could include a share from your Office 365 Home if you have it.

<p><span>You are unable to open Bitlocker on windows 8 computer. </span></p>

<p><span>When you add new files to the Windows 7 or other operating system drive or partition that is encrypted with BitLocker, BitLocker encrypts them automatically. Files remain encrypted only while they are stored in the encrypted drive. Files that are copied
 to another drive, partition, or computer are decrypted.</span></p>
