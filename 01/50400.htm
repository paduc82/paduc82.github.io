<h2>            install windows 8 pro from the &#34;trial&#34; version</h2>
                    Trying to install windows 8 pro from the "trial" version which now restarts every two hours. Unfortunately the install only gets to 35% in two hours. I don't mind waiting, but how do you stop the re-start every two hours? Is there an other solution? I
 am on broadband, wired, speed 9M down, 1M up, and I've stopped Skype (this increased the % from 17 to 35).

<p>In order to install Windows 8 Pro upgrade, you will first need to reinstall your original version of Windows that was running on your computer prior to installing the Windows 8 Release Preview. Whether that is (Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7). After installing
 it, you can then do an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. The Windows 8 Release Preview does not support upgrades to Windows 8 Pro.

<h2>            Unable to resize the Outlook Window</h2>
                    <p>original title: Lost my Outlook Window</p>
<p>I have been unable to grab my Outlook when it is undocked. I can hover over the thumbnail in the task bar and maximize the window, and can minimize it, but when I click restore down from the maximized window, the program disappears.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I hover over the icon in the taskbar, I can see a sliver of a window, but as soon as I leave the thumbnail, it disappears.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried both move and size, and they both give me the cross arrows, but I cannot do anything with them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suspect that I inadvertently sized the window too small, and it is remembering where it is. Any idea on how to go about resolving this problem? Is there a way to manually reset the size? Or clear the memory of where the windows are?</div>
                </div>

            Click Windows + Right or Windows + Left (the arrow keys) that will resize it half the screen size and then you should be able to resize as you like.

<h2>            Network problems with certain games</h2>
                    Both xbox ones in my house have issues playing halo mcc multiplayer and modern warfare 2 backwards compatible. With halo we&nbsp; only like to play halo 2 classic playlists so I cant speak for other playlists but considering how every single game, and I literally
 mean every single match, we try to play has issues. Every match at some point will put us on the black screen that says connecting to game. Usually you can tell when it is about to happen because the gameplay becomes really laggy. I would say 1 out of 3 games
 will kick us back to the main menu with a box that says lost network connection to the game and we will have a timed penalty for playing matchmaking again. MW2 will either lock up trying to find a game or one of us will be booted before the match starts and
 every match is laggy. Sometimes it will kick us back to main menu and say you are not connected to xbox live even though if you check the actual xbox dashboard we are still connected. So needless to say those 2 games ar

            It could be due to the popularity of those titles as I'm personally on The Division 2 on a near constant basis right now without issue.&nbsp; It might be worthwhile checking with the publishers of those games to see if there are any known issues with them at
 this time.

<p>I've thought about it possibly being the games themselves but with halo mcc in particular I just cant imagine that the player base would have has many as it does if alot of people were having this problem. Mw2 it would be hard to tell because most people
 playing it are probably still playing on 360. We are going to test some of the other games we have and see if any others have problems also.</p>

<p>The thing is everything on my end tests fine. I talked to xbox a couple weeks ago and the only thing he said he seen wrong was my upnp was low. He tried a few things but in the end nothing helped and he just decided it was something with ISP. Called them
 and they say they see no issues. I've wondered if it is something with how the xbox communicates with my router.</p>

<p>Hi there MatthewCarr2, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for updating us on the issue. I understand there is an issue with playing multiplayer matches on Halo MCC and MW2. Thank you for checking the NAT type. One thing I do recommend is to double check your network configuration. Different game servers&nbsp;have
 platform-specific TCP and UDP ports. Check out these articles for more information:</p>

            I opened up all of the ports listed for both xboxes and it did help some. We have been able to play MW2 now but only if we stay in the playlist initially picked when you first log on and party up. If we try to back out of the lobby we get placed in and
 select another playlist or even the same one we start having the same problems and have to reset both xboxes before we can actually party up and find a match. Halo on the other hand has gotten much better for the most part. Neither one of us has gotten completely
 disconnected from a game now. Receiving the blue screen every single match doesnt happen anymore but it does happen most matches. Weird thing is sometimes it is just one of us that gets it. Last night for example my roommate kept getting it over and over in
 the same match while I was able to play. After about 6 times in row over the course of 2 or 3 min he would go to blue screen and then come back to match but after just a couple of seconds he would be back in the blue screen. Eventuall

<p>Tried all of these. Still the same problems. Nat types are open on both consoles and all network settings are same. Reaching someone for MW2 backwards compatible seems almost impossible. Hoping to get a response from 343 for Halo MCC</p>

<h2>            On boot&#58; 50&#37;&#43; of ram in use &#40;10&#47;16gb&#41; - where is it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently I've been having ram issues on my desktop. On boot up, after logging in I will have upwards of 10gb of ram 'in use' before even opening applications. I have a laptop which also has 16gb of ram, however on boot up will hardly use more than 6gb.
 Now this wouldn't normally alarm me, windows like to use what it can and if its there, why not make better use of the ram. Sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after using my PC for more than 4hours or so, my ram usage will be 99% (15.8gb) from having maybe chrome open (which I know is notorious for similar problems, but I'm confident its not chrome as I have used Firefox for about a month when this was
 happening) and sometimes, just leaving my&nbsp;machine idle, it can reach this. -&gt; and if&nbsp;I close my applications, it may drop by about 1-2gb, but never any lower. Causing me to restart at least&nbsp;twice a day (which can get really frustrating). This means I usually
 can't have more than one application open on this machine otherwise the programs start to stutter (due to not getting enough ram). That's&nbsp;ridiculous for a machine with 16gb of ram!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, it sounds like I either have a memory leak in one of my programs, windows aren't letting go of ram from closed applications, I have some ram eating virus like a silent bitcoin miner... or some concoction of them all (maybe even faulty ram). I've taken
 some screenshots right after booting my machine:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf84b3cd-bdef-4b59-9e87-e8265a1cbbaa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf84b3cd-bdef-4b59-9e87-e8265a1cbbaa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>FYI, I have seen the compressed up to&nbsp;3gb when my ram gets into the 99%.</p>
<p>Next is my active startup programs:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d014cee-96ef-42dd-87ba-0984e3753682?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d014cee-96ef-42dd-87ba-0984e3753682?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Which to me looks like a typical set of programs (WinDock is a window anchoring program as my monitor is 3440x1440)</p>
<p>This is what my total ram usage is according to my profile:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a25e920-d48a-4e7a-9a09-a209271cf02f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a25e920-d48a-4e7a-9a09-a209271cf02f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Which again, is not very large...<br />
This is what resource manager says about my ram:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47fe98e9-93f4-472e-843e-d3c88b51a2dd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47fe98e9-93f4-472e-843e-d3c88b51a2dd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I just can't see where this ram is going. On resource monitor, nearly all the programs normal/tiny amounts of ram. If you would like a full report on that I can post that too.<br />
<br />
lastly, let me state my PC spec:</p>
<p>Ram: (8x2) 16gb DDR3 @ 2133MHz Corsair Vengence<br />
Motherboard:&nbsp;GA-Z97X-Gaming 3<br />
CPU:&nbsp;CORE I7-4790K 4.00GHZ (DEVIL'S CANYON) SOCKET LGA1150</p>
<p>Graphics card: GTX 1080 ROG Strix O8G<br />

<p>You have non-paged pool of 5.4 GB. This indicates a driver problem. There is also an indication that you have a Killer network card. These are notorious for causing memory leaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can try getting updated Killer software or removing everything apart from the basic driver.</p>

<h2>            Windows Mail. Empty Folder will not delete</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have emptied an unused Folder and tried to delete it from my list of Folders. It is now a sub-folder and displays under the Deleted folder. When I right click to delete the folder and asked do I really want to delete it, a message appears at the top of
 the screen in an orange coloured banner stating the Folder cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Any suggestions welcomed.</p>

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Who is your service provider like Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo, GoDaddy......? Can you login to the Web interface of your service provider and try to delete from there?

<p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>My internet provider does not give access to my Outlook account. I should be able to add or delete folders from the Microsoft Mail interface.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a known issue with Mail which other users have encountered?</p>
<p>I'm at a loss to know how to proceed with this but thank you for your response.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi MNewsome,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Microsoft Tun miniport adapter is part of the Vista networking architecture.&nbsp; It is used by the IPv6 protocol.&nbsp; Since IPv6
 is a very new Internet protocol that is not really being used much yet, chances are that you are not using this device and therefore it is not causing any problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to run the Fixit for Hardware devices and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to uninstall and reinstall the&nbsp;<span><span><span>Microsoft
 Tun Miniport adapter</span></span></span>&nbsp;</span><span>and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall the drivers from the Device manager</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click start and type devmgmt.msc in Start Search and press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In Device Manager click on View and select show hidden devices,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. After select show hidden devices go to Network adapter right click on Microsoft Tun Miniport adapter and select the option
 uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are still facing issues, then you may refer the manufatcurerâ€™s website and try updating the chipset and network adapters
 and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>

    <title>Wireless Display Adapter Lag Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michalmikuå¡  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Display Adapter Lag Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have a Surface Pro 4, Win 10Pro 64, i5-6300U, 8GB RAM, (all updates installed) &nbsp;and and the MWDA 1628 (FRM V.1.3.8305), so all Microsoft and all up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the week I am at work in Paris and I use the MWDA to project on a full HD monitor in my hotel room. The devices are on the same desk so the distance between them is about 30 centimeters.
</p>
<p>On weekends I am at home in Germany where I use it to connect to my full HD Panasonic TV. The distance is about 3 meters.</p>
<p>In both situations I am using the HDMI extension cable provided with the MWDA so the device is not hidden behind the TV/monitor.</p>
<p>And even so I am in both situations dealing with the following issues.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connecting to the device almost never works at the first time. The Surface connects to MWDA for like 3 seconds and then disconnects again. Most of the times without a error message. Sometimes it is not able to connect at all... But after few tries I am
 able to establish the connection. Always. So this point is not so urgent but it would be a "nice to have" feature if it would work on the first try.</li><li>The extended monitor/TV suffers by low frame rate, delay, lugs and vertical asynchronicity meaning:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>low frame rate - I do not know exactly how low it is, but you can see, that the video is not fluent. My guess would be about 40 fps. But it is only a guess.</li><li>delay - the audio comes sometimes just a half a second later after the image and also if I work for example, in excel and I move the mouse the delay is there. Not much but it is there.</li><li>lugs - lugs are just lugs. The streamed video goes almost fluently, with an fps as described before and suddenly a frame or so is missing. Most of the time followed by the&nbsp;vertical asynchronicity and audio delay.</li><li>vertical asynchronicity - sometimes you can see in the lower part an other frame as in the upper part.</li></ul>
<p>All this happens all the time and from the beginning, with youtube, netflix and other streamed video sources as well as with Media Player, VLC and even during normal work with office.</p>
<p>I can understand if there are new borns issue with the Surface 4 Pro, believe me, I do deal with them but the MWDA is not new and except for work(office) and web reading is the device uselles. And if you buy a "premium" product (Surface) and original accessory
 (MWDA) hoping it will do exactly what you need and all your hardware and software is from the same company and it does not work correctly than it starts to be... let us say annoying.</p>
<p>So if somebody could help me, or at least tell me, where to ask for help (there are no Microsoft retail stores in France or Germany) I would be really greatfull.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            <div>Sorry that I missed seeing the firmware version. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have to think that most of this IS the drivers/hardware on the SP4. You could</div>
<div>experiment with the generic video drivers from Intel (but they may cause other</div>
<div>problems).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You're unlikely to get any decent support from Microsoft on this (other than</div>
<div>"reset the MWDA", check for 2.4GHz interference,&nbsp; "refresh/reset your Surface",</div>
<div>etc.). </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are enough other video/power management issues with the SP4 for me to</div>
<div>think that the Miracase issues are probably related. It took Microsoft 9 months</div>
<div>to solve wireless driver issues with the Surface Pro 3, FWIW. </div>

<p>Isso aconteceu comigo e era o controle parental , tinha jogo que quando ia pra alguma cutscene ele voltava ao menu .Da uma conferida nisso e nas suas configuraÃ§oes de rede reinicie tudo inclusive a rede.</p>
<p>Se nada der certo de um master reset , o console vai voltar as configuraÃ§oes de fabrica , mas sus saves continuam a salvo. Tente primeiro o cotrole parental , depois reinicie as configuraÃ§oes de rede , e por ultimo o master reset</p>

    <title>Stop Aero Snap from interacting with the non-active window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kindlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Aero Snap from interacting with the non-active window</h2>
                    <p>I love aero snap. With my dual monitors I can quickly snap windows to various sides of my monitor without wasting time manually readjusting the window for maximum viewing; unless I want to manually adjust a snapped window for some reason, any reason. The
 difficulty comes from everything that happens after a snap, and I wish we had the following options regarding snap features (I would disable each one, but some people probably like them):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enable/Disable&nbsp;tiling the remaining (non-snapped) windows for alternate side snapping after you do your first snap (clicking the middle space cancels this which I'm grateful for, but the whole thing is too visually upsetting).</p>
<p>Enable/Disable adjusting adjacent snapped window's size when you adjust the active window. (the black bar thing, I currently have to drag 1 window away from the top slightly to un-snap it and allow me to adjust each window independently)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be some other features that I haven't found yet why they are annoying, but I can be sure that they are annoying, at least to someone, somewhere, for some reason. Please add options to remove or disable any and all sub features for Aero Snap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND ON THAT NOTE:</p>
<p>This disabling of subfeatures is actually something that is missing from nearly all windows 10 features, which consistently lump too much into a single check box or drop down. So many potentially awesome features exist that only do 1 or 2 annoying things,
 but you lump it in with 10 other features that must all be enabled or disabled. That feature is then immediately disabled by all savvy users who prefer the original functionality, even if they would have liked some of the other functionality you guys created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, let us customize our computer how we want to. (Required security updates, etc. are fine, I'm talking about simple visual and ease of use things)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Aero Snap feature is a way to effortlessly position Windows on the desktop just the way you want them. However, if you opt to stop or disable the feature, you can disable it by simply going to the
<strong>Settings</strong> tab, click <strong>System</strong>, then select <strong>
Multitasking</strong>. Under <strong>Snap</strong> menu, you will see 4 Snap options. you can toggle it
<strong>On</strong> or <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance regarding this concern, just send us a reply.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the most canned and useless answer conceivable. I wrote three paragraphs for my question because I knew you'd want to use some canned-response and my questions requires
<em>the exact opposite of the typical Aero canned responses</em>, where everyone just wants to turn it off cuz it does too much they don't want it to. Well, iIf you had read my VERY FIRST SENTENCE this would have been obvious. My title doesn't even imply that
 I want Aero turned off at all. This must have been a bot. I hope this was a bot. A really bad bot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me reiterate:</p>
<p>I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to turn off Aero Snap. I <strong>do </strong>
want the ability to <em>customize</em> what Aero Snap actually does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last paragraph of my OP expounds upon how this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
lack of customization for so many different features in windows 10</span> should be addressed so that your customers aren't forced to neglect and disable so much of the OS that you thought was so useful and cool and spent so much time and effort to develop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I know that customization requires more effort to implement, but that's the cost of making something all people can actually enjoy.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

                    <span>
<div><strong>Ok, so i just restored my Acer Aspire 5935G to factory settings, and it completed fine. Trouble is, i now get an error code (which loops continuously) when the set-up is at the "Setup is preparing your computer for first use", and i don't know
 what to do to fix it.</strong></div>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong><br />
The actual error code is:<br />
<br />
"The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows, click "OK" to restart the computer, and then restart the installation".<br />
<br />
<br />
However, i do press "OK", but the laptop restarts, and boots up to the same point and gives me the same error code.<br />
<br />
Anything i can do?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I DO NOT have any CD's or anything like that to do with the laptop, but it was bought from PC world so i have no doubts that the copy is genuine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, any help would be massively appreciated.</strong></div>

<p><span>Hi MaelStormer,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to Andre Da Costa's suggestion, you to follow the steps below and check if it helps you
 fix the issue. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This might happen if the drivers fail to install properly during the installation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Disconnect all the external USB devices except for keyboard and mouse.</span></li><li><span>When the computer restarts,</span><span>keep
 tapping F8 key. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode select it and press enter.</span></li><li><span>On booting to safe mode you may receive a message stating that the setup cannot be completed in
 safe mode.</span> </li><li><span>Donâ€™t exit and restart.</span></li><li><span>Press shift + F10 key together, this will bring up command prompt.</span></li><li><span>In the command prompt window, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span></li><li><span>In the device manager, you may expand the following devices and right click on it and disable the
 device.</span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>Ã˜<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Display
 Adapters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ã˜<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Sound,
 video and game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ã˜<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Network
 Adapters.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Restart the computer and check if the installation completes successfully.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to complete the installation, you may access device manager again and try to enable
 the above devices and update it with the latest drivers. You may also access the computer manufacturer website and download the latest drivers and install it. Later connect all the external devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know how to open device manager.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to update the drivers for the above devices from the device manager and check if it helps
 you fix the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>I have a copy of visual basic .net 2003 that I purchased in 2003 (imagine that). I have never used it but I now would like to try my hand at creating some applications that will run in Windows 7, Windows 8x, and Windows 10. Can I successfully use my current
 copy of VB.net or do I have to upgrade to a newer version of VB.net (Visual Studio)?</p>
<p>If I can use my current copy, is there anything special that I would have to do to be able to use it?</p>

            Hi An
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It is not certified compatible to run on Windows 10 and you are likely to encouter compatibility issues. This release came out I believe around 2002/2003, so the target operating system was Windows XP. 
<br />
<br />It is even reported to have issues running on latest versions like Vista (now obselete) and even Windows 7.
<br />
<br />So, I can't imagine you having much success getting it work on Windows 10, which is refreshed every 6 months.
<br />
<br />Your best option is to setup a virtual machine with Windows XP and install it there. 
<br />
<br />Learn how you can do that:
