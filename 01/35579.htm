<h2>            How can I find a disabled task</h2>
                    <p>In preparation for running PCmover (XP to 7) per their instructions I am disabling tasks that are scheduled to start in the next 24 hours.&nbsp; On XP this is trivial as you can pause all scheduled tasks.&nbsp; There is no such option on 7 so I went to the task scheduler
 and started disabling ones that are supposed to run in the next day.&nbsp; However, I did not make a note of which ones I disabled only to discover that the task scheduler does not provide a way to show disabled tasks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find the ones I disabled so I can enable them after the PCmover run?&nbsp;

            <p>You can find disabled ones by observing the "status" column of the task scheduler window.&nbsp; It will say "disabled" if the task is disabled.</p>

            Hi KC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Well you can certainly take it back under the store return policy to get another, or contact HP for help fixing or replacing it free for the first year under the included warranty.
<br />
<br />But first you can Update your drivers from the HP Support Downloads web page here <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>, using the Serial Number  on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Try removing and replacing the battery to see if you can get it detected.  If not contact HP to help you troubleshoot and if necessary replace the battery. 
<br />
<br />You can also run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            This (and every other fix I have seen for the error "The procedure entry point RtlCopyContext could not be located in the dynamic link library ntdll.dll" does not work. I have done 4 format and installs and each time I try to load the Service Pack 1 for
 Windows 7 results in this error. After looking at the forums this problem has been around a very long time. Why have no fixes been established? Why have you not pulled Service Pack 1 and fixed it before putting it up to destroy everyones computer? I have tried
 everything listed in the forums on this but nothing works. I have a new Asus gaming computer, there is nothing wrong with it until I try and update to service pack 1. I hope they don't do something stupid (like I know they will) that requires you to have this
 service pack to run or me and everyone else with this problem is screwed. Yay Microsoft. Thinking of getting a Mac....

            <p>excuse my bad english generaly i speak french but i have found the probleme and im happy to give you my trick cause if something can **** me off its an unworking computer then i use all my compation to wish about you will understand my words lollll XD</p>
<p>I found the solution cause i just got the same trouble with the last update i made.
</p>
<p>dont wast your time on the update list to delete theme one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;if you remember the time you made the update who **** up your systeme its good cause you can do this: on win 7 for me</p>
<p>&nbsp;go to the CONTROL PANEL then RECOVERY</p>
<p>&nbsp;clic on open recovery systeme</p>
<p>&nbsp;Like in a game you can go backward in the time with your pc to undone the wrong updates and they give you 2 choice.
</p>
<p>recomanded recovery and choose an other recovery point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So choose an other recovery point and you will see a little list of ''check point'' with the date of each one. i got the error this date 10/21/1012 then i decided to return to 10/20/1012. this worked for me. the computer will take several minutes to recovery
 then he will restart.(rtlcopycontext could not be located in the dynamic link library ntdll.dll) you will never see this error message again. and the updates got return to the able update list. Its up to you if you want to do the updates again but i recommand
 you to do them one by one and restart your computer between each update. like this you will find wich update is the bully one XD

<h2>            Question About Minecraft Windows 10 compatibility with Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;had posted this question in Discussion section of forums but have not&nbsp;received any responses so I am reposting the question in the support section of XBOX Support Forums in case I should have posted there instead.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hi,</p><p>I recently redeemed my free Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Code that I got because I own the pc/mac version of Minecraft, and when I activated/claimed the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft it said that the next time I turn on my Xbox One it will automatically download to the console. Now this presents me with a few questions about this. Since I currently do not own an Xbox One&nbsp;I have no way to answer my questions. I have been planning to buy an Xbox One S, and my question is if I get an Xbox One S to play it on will it show up on my Xbox One as Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition or will it show up as Minecraft: Xbox One Edition? Will I only be able to play with other people who have a specific version? and if it will show up on the Xbox one

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;Minebuddy777!</p><p><br /></p><p>Great question!&nbsp;I'm wondering if it might have been a misleading message when you redeemed the code for the game, because Minecraft:&nbsp;Windows 10 Edition is only for Windows 10. There is no Play Anywhere for Minecraft at this time, and you would need to purchase the game on the console if you would like to play it there.</p><p><br /></p><p>Later this year, crossplay will be possible between PC&nbsp;and Xbox One users, however that is not currently available.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hopefully I answered what you were looking for!&nbsp;Please let me know if I can address any other concerns. I'm happy to help where I&nbsp;can. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<h2>            KB4056894 causing my Win 7 Pro Dell Laptop to blank the screen every 10-15 minutes</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I recently installed KB4056894, the Jan 18 Monthly Rollup. Prior to doing so, my Dell Inspiron 1420 laptop running Windows 7 Pro had been working just fine. Since the update was installed yesterday, every 10-15 minutes, my screen
 goes entirely black for about 3-5 seconds, as if the display driver is crashing and restarting. It doesn't appear to affect any of my running programs, nor does it crash the computer. But clearly, it should not be causing the display to go black.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here to help. Did you notice any activity that might be causing the screen to go black? And when it goes black, does the desktop come back up immediately or does the PC crash? We're thinking that this issue might be due to a faulty hardware driver
 after the update. To verify this, kindly start your PC in safe mode and check if the issue persists. You may refer to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a></strong> on how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem goes away when in safe mode, it's safe to assume that it is a driver issue. If that is the case, we suggest that you download and install the latest display driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Hello Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the very same problem with KB4056894 on my Dell Latitude with WIN 7 and found a way to solve it doing the following:</p>
<p>1. manually uninstall KB4056894 (and reboot) </p>
<p>2. disable windows-auto-updates temporarily </p>
<p>3. manually install KB4073578 (update for crashing systems with AMD chips, but works fine on Intel systems as well - due to minimal documentation on this one I'm not sure what security issues are adressed by the update compared to the original KB4056894)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit sceptical about the hypothesis that the problem results from a crashing display driver. What relates the AMD fix for the Windows security update to Intel HD graphics in our laptops? Anything else may have been changed from KB4056894 to KB4073578
 so the problem no longer occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe someone else has some ideas on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

                    I have 6 people who added me as a friend. I did not know these people so I blocked and muted them. These people remained stuck in my follower's list even after they stopped following me. I have made contact with some of these people and they have confirmed
 that they have removed me as their friend. I can view their friend's list and I can see all of the people they are following and I am not there. Who do I contact to have this glitch corrected and have them removed

            Yes but blocking and muting does not remove someone who is not following me<br />
. Let me explain it as if I was the person who added me. Okay here goes, I recently added someone as a friend but they blocked and muted me without adding me back. So I changed my relationship with this person and removed them as a friend. I no longer see them
 in my friend's list and that is what is supposed to happen. But for some reason, my profile is stuck in their follower's list and it says I am still following them. How am I still in their follower's list when I am no longer following them almost a year later

<p>As with any social media platform, followers are those who are interested in your activity. There is nothing inherently bad about someone following you. If you are not interested in communicating with them, you can certainly mute or block.</p>
<p>

            I don't think you can remove followers, yeah its pretty annoying but lets hope the new console solves this issue! The only thing you can do is remove them as a friend and just ignore your follower count.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can try a System Restore back to a point before this happened.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html</span></a><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It probably is the drivers that are loaded&nbsp;may not really be the latest or they need to be re-installed<br />
anyway. The best way is to look manually using the methods below.<br />
<br />
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
You may have the windows default or an older certified driver and that is part or all of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
<strong>Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback<br />
and then finally install the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not<br />
unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so. Just make sure the version you<br />
installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install<br />
procedure. Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click on - RUN AS <br />
ADMIN - Reboot</strong> <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>After updating driver. (recheck this as it can be changed by the driver update)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;<br />
Disconnected Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them <br />
and then on lower right properties. Make sure the proper one is enabled and check<br />
other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes</strong>.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

<h2>            KINOBO WEBCAM ON WINDOWS 7</h2>
                    <p><span>I bought a&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kinobo B7 Laptop USB 5mpx Webcam For Windows XP/Vista/7 Skype/Yahoo/MSN Includes USB Microphone</span></span></p>
<p><span>for skype.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>PC is a bog standard &nbsp;H/Packard and has windows 7 home edition. Its 3 years old.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, the Webcam software &nbsp;loaded up fine but all I get is a black screen with the loading up circle going around and around ( have left it on for a while to see if it solves it- still nothing)</span></p>
<p><span>I have done the sound test on skype and that’s fine but still can’t get a picture.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have been to options on Skype and checked video settings, &nbsp;the pc says nothing wrong with it, done the DirectX &nbsp;in start to check etc as advised on windows. Test on the devices gives it an ok.</span></p>
<p><span>Skype forums don’t really give anymore advice. I downloaded the new version of skype and the old version to check</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have downloaded Adobe flash etc and using other ports for webcam, still the same black screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have looked on windows forums and they give lots of advice and gooblegook, but some of the downloads people in &nbsp;the forums advise to download &nbsp;I am not wanting to do just in case.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not sure if its my pc or I need to have something else on the pc that I am not aware of. Is there some other video settings I have to do or check or get from Microsoft?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been ok&nbsp; with&nbsp; editing videos from my camcorder so getting a moving picture is ok.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any advice, </span></p>

            <p>Hello Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you checked if your webcam is working with any other applications?</p>
<p>2. Is the webcam seen in the Device Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A webcam is a video input device, similar to a scanner or camera, and will not work unless you have software that works with your webcam hardware. Check you should have latest software from manufacturer website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let`s uninstall the webcam from the device manager and reinstall it.</strong></p>
<p>a) Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌ If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b) Look for the USB (Universal Serial Bus controllers) or other devices and expand it. Now, right click on it and select Uninstall. When prompted for confirmation check the box which says “Delete the driver software for this device” and click OK.</p>
<p>c) Restart the computer. Windows will now try to find the latest drivers for the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly </strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow the steps from Skype support&nbsp;to check the issue.</strong></p>
<p>How can I solve problems with video calling in Skype for Windows desktop? </p>
<p><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1267/how-can-i-solve-problems-with-video-calling-in-skype-for-windows-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1267/how-can-i-solve-problems-with-video-calling-in-skype-for-windows-desktop</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you have the latest Windows Updates installed. Check for the optional updates as it may have the required drivers.</strong></p>

            <p>hi</p>
<p>tried all your suggestions &amp; nothing worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this from the Kinobo support page</p>
<p>
</p><p>All our webcam products are plug-and-play, which means we don't usually provide any additional CDs. In order to install a webcam, just plug it into a free USB port and the installation will happen automatically in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, your webcam will be ready to use with your chat or video software. Again, we do not provide any additional software, as this is in most cases unneccessary. Other companies provide&nbsp; installation CDs with a lot of unneccessary software,
 which can slow the computer down or show unwanted advertising. We believe that you should choose the software you wish to use and not one that we dictate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to test the webcam without using Skype or a similar chat program, you can download free software, such as
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/WebcamViewer/3000-12510_4-75324168.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Webcam Viewer</a> or the trial version of
<a href="http://amcap.en.softonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AmCap</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>end quote</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product is Kinobo, i looked at properties it tells me the driver and driver file are Microsoft. Webcam doesnt work on Microsoft mover maker either. The only driver i have is the printer, no other. Perhaps this webcam doesnt&nbsp; like working &nbsp;with the microsoft
 i have on my pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried Amcap, but not yet webcam&nbsp; viewer although I &nbsp;still&nbsp; suspect nothing. Honestly until i try it in someone elses pc, I must assume the webcam must be faulty.</p>

            <p>Hello Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to check the webcam on another computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to clean boot the system and check the webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1,
 Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

    <title>trying to download Firefox, program claims I need Administrative - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> td san  say:</h3>
<h2>            trying to download Firefox, program claims I need Administrative permissions but I am the only Administrator account on the computer</h2>
                    <p>Have recently been having issues with internet browsers. Started with Firefox, can't remember specifics but uninstalling and reinstalling had no effect. We gave up and switched to Chrome but the problems only escalated. Malware and adware programs downloading
 themselves and jacking stuff up. Got the malicious software removed, but now that I want to go back to Firefox, my computer refuses to allow it to download. The exact message I get when I run the setup is
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"You may not have the necessary permissions to use all the features of the program you are about to run. You may run this program as a different user or continue to run the program as the current user."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then it gives me the option of sticking with the current user or logging in as a different user with Administrator privileges, complete with a box for the password. The problem is, there is only one user account and it already has Administrator privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;concerned I&nbsp;may have a bot in my system or something but I have no idea how to find out.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem before?&nbsp;Did you figure out what was causing it? Any suggestions or recommendations&nbsp;at all? We're getting to the point where we're considering reinstalling&nbsp;Windows and hoping the problem just goes away.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please Advise&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Is it only Firefox that is asking for Admin rights, or any install attempts for other programs? If its other programs as well, not just Firefox, can you create a new 'fresh' Admin account as a backup? If so, do it and set a password on it. See what happens
 from that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A quick search on google finds others with a similar problem, and strange as it seems some appear to have installed firefox by right-clicking the installation file and clicking 'run as administrator' even though they are already the administrator!! Maybe
 worth a try.</p>

http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100913165104AAfD5aX</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know the choice is yours but general advice is NOT to run as administrator day to day, but for most ( if not all ) work to run as a normal user account -

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check for malware try: </p>
<p>First, update your AV package and run a full scan, then download, install, update and run a scan with free

<p>
</p><p>I have registered for an interview via Skype and am requested to list me Skype username. The problem is, I have no idea what that is... is my Skype username my email, phone number, etc? I've searched details of my account and can't find further information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched my name from a friend's Skype account and I found myself listed under my name among multiple others. Under my name it had a code listed "live:" followed by a string of numbers and letters. Is this code my username?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>As per your description ""live:" followed by a string of numbers and letters", this might indicate that your Skype account information was created using

</p><p>If you will search your name from a friend's account, here is how it should be:
</p>
<p>&lt;<strong>+</strong>&gt;&lt;<strong>area code</strong>&gt;&lt;<strong>exact mobile number</strong>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: You cannot search for your own username while logged in to the same account.</em></p>

            I've had the problem where it freezes randomly and&nbsp;Googled&nbsp;it a while ago and found it is a known issue where computers paged out due to sp1. i uninstalled sp1 back then and the freezing stopped. trust me i know its the problem. heres a link to confirm
 this for you http://www.technize.net/fix-windows-7-service-pack-1-random-freezes/. but now that i have had to use the&nbsp;installation&nbsp;disc there is no backup file to delete sp1 due to it being on the&nbsp;installation&nbsp;disc and i have this freezing again and the hotfix
 microsoft provided for this known issue dos not fix the problem.

            <p>Have to confess I have numerous win7 installations all updated and never come across this issue, not that thats any comfort to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot uninstall sp1 if its imbeded in your win7 installation disk, and any of the official MS win7 ISO's all contain sp1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I see it, apart from ensuring any system drivers have been updated, and disconnecting any external devices or any third party cards, other than graphics to see if that helps isolate the issue, possibly also ensuring any ssd firmware is updated, your next
 port of call would be paid for support.</p>
<p>If indeed its a hotfix/known issue it wont be charged - at least thats&nbsp;my experience -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also want to run extended memory tests, <a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Xbox one..shuts off after 1 hour</h2>
                    Xbox one comes on , then will shut off after approximately a hour. No red lights or overheat warnings. Will turn right back on every time. But always shuts off in in around an hour, sometimes shorter. ...the inactivity shut down is turned off as well..no
 reason I can find for it, Is there any fix? Or time to buy a new one?

    <title>Windows 10 system image folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grahamleo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 system image folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a System Image Backup on my external drive but it is telling me it is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it has backed up because I watched it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I using a third party app to give me confidence in the Backup as it has been suggested by other forums?</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

            You are on the right track with your lack of confidence. An untested backup is only slightly better than no backup at all. You should now restart the machine into Windows Repair Mode (by pressing Shift+Restart), then open the repair mode and check if it
 can detect the image you made. It will not attempt a restore until you give it the final go-ahead.

<p>Hello Fredrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I follow your suggestion, it detected a single Image which is all I had, but the problem is it had the wrong Drive letter, it was D rather than what should be E which is my external hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I should change it to E, continue on and expect the result I want when the requirement presents itself.</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>All is well! While in Windows Repair Mode, drive letters are often quite different from the ones you see in Normal Mode. Have a look at drive D: while in Normal Mode. Can you see a folder called "WindowsImageBackup"? I bet you can't!</p>

<p>Thank you Frederik again for your prompt reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In normal mode there is no drive D, which is not unexpected because I don't have any reason for one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a folder "WindowsImageBackup" located on my external drive (E) which I have wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the folder it is telling me it is empty, opening further into the folder I do find the backup, I just now have to confident that it is going to do the job when the need arises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think now with your next comments I will understand where I'm at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks and Regards</p>

<h2>            Need Help - Laptop freezing and crashing during Gameplay.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello all. I hope someone can help me because nothing has helped so far. Basically the issue first and foremost is that my laptop has been crashing during and after gameplay. Even if I haven't played for that long like to test it. It first happened
 a few days ago when I updated my graphics driver. </span><br />
<br />
<span>I have the Inspiron 7577 laptop from Dell, with the i5 Intel processor and the 1060 Max Q. 8Gb ram. Some more information: Sometimes when it crashes it will beep at me, either right after I Control Alt Delete my way into restarting it. Every time it crashes
<span>I have the Inspiron 7577 laptop from Dell, with the i5 Intel processor and the 1060 Max Q. 8Gb ram. Some more information: Sometimes when it crashes it will beep at me, either right after I Control Alt Delete my way into restarting it. Every time it crashes
 my Xbox one wireless controller connected via Bluetooth disconnects. Then the mouse is unresponsive and then it crashes. Sometimes it would either hard crash like that or crash straight to Desktop during gameplay.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I factory reset my laptop twice. I've talked with someone at Nvidia and they had me updated my integrated display Drivers. That of course didn't fix it. I contacted Windows support and they remote accessed my computer and fixed some Driver incompatibilities
<span>I factory reset my laptop twice. I've talked with someone at Nvidia and they had me updated my integrated display Drivers. That of course didn't fix it. I contacted Windows support and they remote accessed my computer and fixed some Driver incompatibilities
 and updated to the newest version of Windows 10. Didn't help. I talked with Dell and He said my laptop was crashing because it couldn't handle the games. (laugh) I was testing MK XL at the time. Mind you the same issues happen with The Walking Dead Season
 3 and every other game I tested.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I thought I fixed the issue last night when I installed DirectX. It was working fine for the most part. Then it froze up and crashed and even beeped. At that point I gave up and went to bed. This has been extremely annoying as I just got this laptop.

 What can I try to fix this issue? I just updated my graphics driver to the one released in October. Gonna restart and test it. My laptop shouldn't be beeping. I don't know what that is about. Something tells me the issues go hand in hand cause they happen
 at the same time. When it crashes it doesn't always beep though. Should I updated the BIOS or change settings in the firmware? I'm not really sure what to try. Thanks to anyone who trys to help.
