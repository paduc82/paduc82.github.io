    <title>Cannot delete or move some files after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ufyjolk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete or move some files after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a weird problem: just now I noticed a problem popped up after upgrading to Windows 10 x64: I'm having trouble moving and deleting some files.</p>
<p>This issue seems to affect completely random files/folders, while ignoring others. Also: sometimes the problem goes away completely of its own accord (and then it may decide to return...)</p>
<p>When I try to move affected files I get an error "Invalid MS-DOS function".</p>
<p>When deleting files, I usually get a question if I really want to permanently remove the file (I don't use the recycle bin) and I click yes. Then, one of two things can happen if the file/folder is affected: either nothing (no error but no deletion confirmation
 either) or the files get deleted, but they come back after a second or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is up-to-date, file system is (of course) ntfs. There should be no filesystem/physical errors on the disc, as I did chkdsk a few days ago and it repaired the only error it found. Running file explorer and deleting/moving files as an administrator
 gives same results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any of you have a similar problem or have any idea how to fix it? Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: (don't know if this is relevant): I'm also affected by the shut down problem on this HP Pavillion laptop and waiting patiently for some hotfix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Found solution (as below): restarting your machine should do the trick.</p>

 restart with no help. I have not added any applications nor made any other changes. This is weird as it was okay 2 days ago. I can create new files &amp; do anything to them okay.

            I am having the same problem, have rebooted, gone back to last saved point and all that happens is the problem gets worse. It started with two Zip files, now it affects all video and images, even screen dump pasted into paint and saved as a jpeg. This
 seems, having looked at a lot of other sites this has become a major problem with Windows 10. Let's hope they read these entries and give us an update or way to solve the problem.

            <p>Nothing from MS but have sort of solved the problem (I hope). I found that the files and folders had all be set to "read only" and my permissions changed stopping me as being administrator. I reset permissions, which remained OK and to also reset all folders
 and files from "read only". Everything then worked as normal but noticed that the files and folders had returned to read only!!!!. Looked into this and found this was also a common problem that users were asking MS to solve. It appeared that MS had told some
 that had contacted them to ignor this. So far all has been OK. There are problems with getting the MS-DOS function problem as well as files being reset to read only, and some developers think that MS may be on the verge of bringing out a fix. Let's hope they
 are right.</p>
<p>I suggest you look at your files and folders, if they are read only, change them, also check permissions and set the permission so you can act as administrator and then do what you need to do and hope, like me, that the problem does not come back. Hope this
 helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Resolution</h2>
                    <p>Good morning. Yesterday I noticed that the resolution on my computer dropped from 4K to 1080. I went into display settings and I am unable to adjust the resolution any higher than 1080. I have previously had no problem setting the resolution to 4K.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is connected to my home theatre av receiver (Yamaha RX-V683) via a DVI to HDMI cable. It then connects to my Samsung UHD TV via HDMI cable. My graphics card is a Radeon RX 470 with the drivers fully updated. I also checked windows for any updates
 and it's fully up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why the resolution has dropped all of a sudden when I haven't touched any settings and it has been set at 4K since I got my new TV earlier this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kris, <br />
<br />
<br />
Are you still encountering the issue?<br />
Did you notice if there were any updates installed on your computer before you encountered the issue?<br />
<br />
If you still encounter the issue, I suggest that you perform a rollback on your display driver. You can check the instructions on how to do that from this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/display-driver-rollback/09f0fabf-c763-4f9a-96a6-336068d17f95">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />

Regards.

                    <p>Cortana works fine on my W10 notebook but when I am directed to download it to my Nexus 6P phone as well, Google Play Store refuses to download claiming "This item is not available in your country". Why not? My W10 notebook and my smartphone are both in
 the same country - Australia.</p>

            Cortana for Android is only available in EN-US, EN-IN, and ZH-CN(China). You can manually get an apk, but I am not quite sure if it would work properly or not.

    <title>OneDrive DEleted thousands of my files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherwinkaplanyh  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive DEleted thousands of my files</h2>
                    I reinstalled Win 10 on one of my laptops (HP Stream 11) because it could not update to 1803, due to its limited 32 GB C: drive. I moved OneDrive to the D: drive (64 GB SanDisk). Since I HAD nearly 90 GB on OneDrive, I wanted a combo of on-demand and on-machine
 folders. I configured the HP Stream to do that. I have discovered thousands of missing files on my other laptop. I made no changes to it since I upgraded it to 1803 on April 30. I just turned off on-demand on the 2nd laptop to stop the carnage. How do I recover
 the missing files? Yes I have an onsite backup, but if&nbsp; I have to go that route, OneDrive will have failed as a useful product, and I will need to switch to another cloud service that is reliable. I am extremely unhappy that it is deleting and reloading files
 and eating my limited monthly data cap. This will be both annoying and expensive. It appears that you did not think thru or test this very common scenario.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for your reply. The files were in the OneDrive recyle but it still took around 10 hours and much of my monthly data to get them back. I am still not sure all is back to before. I have no faith in the files on demand and the interface. How about warning
 people before deleting 12000 files? I live in a small town with a terrible isp and no other choice. I still don't know how this happened and how to prevent it on the next machine short of not using the feature. It doesn't appear well designed or robust in
 all nite getting my computers back so I am probably still angry. Again, thanks for replying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Failure creating a &#34;System Image&#34; disk to a 4.7 GB DVD</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have had a failure creating a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"System Image"</strong> disk</span> to a<strong> 4.7 GB</strong> DVD through the<strong> "Backup &amp; Restore - Create a system image"</strong> interface via the Windows 7 control
 panel.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions in the tutorial specifically for this purpose on the "Windows Seven Forums" at the URL below:</p>
<p><strong>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/663-backup-complete-computer-create-image-backup.html</strong></p>
<p>I got to the <strong>"Creating a system image"</strong> panel, it said<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Windows is saving a backup...&nbsp; -&nbsp; Preparing media"</span></strong>... then it went through a
<strong>"format media"</strong> process for the 4.7 GB DVD that I was burning to.</p>
<p>And then the progress bar started and got about one inch along before it stopped and and I got a<strong>"Create a system image"</strong> panel that said,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong> "Label and insert a blank media bigger than 1 GB - Please
 write the following label on a blank media and insert it into E:"</strong></span>... and then it gave the name of the computer, the date and time for me to write on the disk.</p>
<p>This didn't make any sense because I already had a <em><strong>4.7 GB DVD</strong></em>in the E drive that this process had already formatted... somehow this
<strong>"System Image"</strong> process was seeing my <em><strong>4.7 DVD&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>as a&nbsp;</strong>
<em><strong>1 GB DVD</strong> </em>.</p>
<p>But there was an <strong>"OK"</strong> button and a<strong> "Stop backup"</strong> button so I said clicked<strong>"OK"</strong> anyway, then it waited for a few seconds and then brought up the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"formatting disk"</strong></span>panel
 again, then started in a loop of that panel and the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>"Label and insert a blank media bigger than 1 GB"</strong> </span>panel, over and over.</p>
<p>I could here the drive starting and stopping when it went around in this loop a couple of more times before I clicked<strong>"Stop Backup"</strong> ... but then it wouldn't stop, no matter how many times I clicked<strong> "Stop Backup"...</strong> it just
 kept in the loop until I had to do an<strong>"End Task"</strong> to stop the process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it didn't do anything to the computer or system because I restarted to be sure and it is fine... I've also checked the function of the DVD drive by playing a CD and that is fine too, thank goodness.</p>
<p>I've also had burnt several DVDs successfully in the last few days with <strong>
"Ashampoo Burning Studio 6"</strong> software with no problems.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any light on this and give me advice on burning a <strong>"System Image"</strong> DVD disk?... the tutorial at the URL above gave specific instructions on selecting the E drive to burn a DVD during this process.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>numetro</p>

<p>I've only used DVDs to store a B/U on once before and had the same problem. The way it was explained to me:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your System Image or Backup is greater than the 4.7 GB available on the DVD, Windows first makes a 'Directory' to tell itself where and when to find the next disk in its proper sequence when it comes time to restore the B/U.</p>

<p>Hi Stuart,</p>
<p><strong>I am using Sony DVD+R DVDs.</strong></p>
<p>The tutorial page at the link that you included is far more lengthy than the one on the "Windows Seven Forums" link that I included above... it didn't say anything about ejecting multiple disks and inserting new ones to continue the process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Does this mean that this "system image" creation process only burns 1 GB to each 4.7 GB disk that I insert?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Also, I was under the impression that if a catastrophic failure happened and no boot is possible and all system info and file info is lost, this "system image" would restore a computer back to it's previous state with all files and apps in tact...
<p>I have a full install Windows 7 ULT disk, not an upgrade, that I installed yesterday and now have several apps installed, 2 user accounts and everything in both accounts set up including lots of taskbar and desktop icons and 19 gigs of system files, data
 and image files total... will a "System Image" series of disks restore back to my current state in case of a meltdown?</p>
<p><strong>And if it only burns 1 GB per DVD, does that mean I'd have to burn a series of 19 DVDs?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you responses,</p>
<p>numetro</p>

<p>No it should use far move than 1GB per DVD. For example a clean install of Windows will fit on 3 DVDs.</p>
<p>Yes if the drive crashes and you need to restore Windows the result is a fully functional version of Windows 7 with all your personal files and apllications.</p>

<p>Hi Stuart,</p>
<p>Why is it giving the message, "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong> "Label and insert a blank media bigger than 1 GB..."</strong></span>&nbsp; then... it hardly burned for one or two minutes before giving me that message.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If a clean install of Windows will fit on 3 DVDs, then why does a Windows 7 ULT full install disk come as</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one DVD and install from that alone ?<br />
</span></p>
<p>Forgive my lack of knowledge here, I'm trying to understand this tricky process.</p>
<p>This is my mom's computer that is finally in a perfect running state with Windows 7 ULT and 2 new GIGS of perfect PNY RAM,&nbsp; after I replaced the 1 GIG of what turned out to be defective RAM that has been running this machine with terrible problems for about
 4 years.</p>
<p>I want to make this "system image" disk, or series of disks, and not mess up the process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Why would the first disk finish so quickly and give the "...bigger than 1 GB" message after burning for only about 1 or 2 minutes... it was really that short.</span></p>
<p><strong>I know that even with a 40x DVD burner drive built in to this Dell, it takes more like a half an hour to burn one 4.7 GB DVD</strong> .</p>
<p>Can you please advise me on this?... I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>numetro</p>

<p>I'm at a loss as to why it only recoginzes your DVD as 1GB (a CD maybe but not a DVD).</p>
<p>Create a 'System Restore' point to backup the registry and then try the following.</p>
<p>How to reset the Backup and Restore’s Action Center:<br />
After the backup failed the Action Center display needs to be reset to clear the error message and the failed backup folders and files deleted from the destination drive in order to perform a successful backup with the correct backup status results.</p>
<p>Start by creating a ‘System Restore’ point before you make any registry changes.</p>
<p>1) Updating the registry:<br />
The following registry change need to be made change the action center status DWORD values.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\Status\ActionCenterState DWORD=0</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\ValidConfig&nbsp; DWORD=0</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since the system originally had another version of Windows did you run the Upgrade Advisor and<br />
check the Compatibility Center for the CD/DVD compatibilty (and other devices as needed).<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - please run this now.<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<p>Also check the Compatibility Center (for major devices)<br />

<p>Check with the System maker and the Device maker for information about drivers for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to firmware for your CD/DVD drive, BIOS, low level chipset drivers,<br />
and other major device drivers.<br />

<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Hi Spirit,</p>
<p>I'm confused by your last reply... are you sending troubleshooting info for my CD/DVD drive from our other thread about burning DVDs that was already answered and solved? That other thread and DVD burning issue was solved when I installed "Ashampoo Burning
 Studio 6" and was able to burn DVDs and CDs flawlessly with no problems... which just left us with the conclusion that the builit-in stock explorer burning app is useless.</p>
<p>I am currently running Windows 7 ULT, which I installed Saturday and it is running solid and with no errors or crashes... 2 new gigs of fresh RAM solved all problems.</p>
<p>Since I am running W7 ULT, I'm not sure why you would suggest running the W7 Upgrade Adviser or the going to the Compatibility Center, which I did a week before I installed a clean install of W7... all hardware and plug-in devices are working perfectly.</p>
<p>Did you copy and paste in your prior letter from the disc burning thread that we were on a couple of days ago?</p>
<p><strong>There is no drive that does not work... the built in DVD burner is working perfectly.</strong></p>
<p>The thread we are on now is<strong> "Failure creating a "System Image" disk to a 4.7 GB DVD"</strong> ... it is the "System Image" process that went wrong last night, recognizing my 4.7 GB DVD as a 1 GB DVD and burning for about 1 minute before it gets in
 to a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"Label and insert a blank media bigger than 1 GB - Please write the following label on a blank media and insert it into E:"</strong></span>and
<p>Since I am able to burn a full 4.7 GB DVD with my new burning app, it has already been determined that there are no problems with my DVD drive.</p>
<p>The advice from you and JW Stuart to use registry key changes to do, something... not sure what, is not sound advice for<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">me</span> ... I am not making registry changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I finally have this machine running solid with new RAM and a 2 day old W7 ULT clean installation with all of it's other software installed and all hardware functioning perfectly... there are no errors crashes or corrupt files. I just ran Check Disk
 and sfc /scannow and I have screenshots of this computer's clean bill of health.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Since the re-install of W7 ULT on Saturday and the new RAM, I have<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> not had one crash or even one error message</span> ... and believe me, I think I've seen them all by now between the prior corrupt Vista
 OS and bad RAM adventure that I've had for 48 days.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I have run the built in Dell PSA diagnostics test on this machine's RAM, the hard drive and processors since the new 2 GIGS of RAM were installed on Saturday...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this computer is as clean as a freshly showered
 18 year old virgin girl.</span></strong></em></p>
<p>I just need to successfully run the "Create System Image Disk" process with however many 4.7 GB DVDs as it takes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm not making any registry updates or registry changes to the<strong>"action center" status "DWORD" values"</strong> ... whatever in the name of hesus that means.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>If JW or Spirit have any advice on following the<em>Pagestart.com</em> tutorial on
<em>"How us use Windows 7's Backup &amp; Restore to create your own customized set of recovery DVD media"</em> and having it actually succeed and finish, then please advise me on this topic.</strong></span></p>

    <title>Incoming faxes being received but not showing up in &#34;InBox&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> answers name  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming faxes being received but not showing up in &#34;InBox&#34;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7, with the built in Windows FAx &amp; Scan. I use my computer sometimes to send &amp; receive faxes. I used to be able to see these in my "Inbox" of the Fax &amp; Scan program. For some reason these are no longer showing up. The only fax in my
 inbox is the "Welcome to Windows FAx &amp; Scan".<br />
<br />
I know the faxes are there, because I can see them in "ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\Inbox"<br />
<br />
I also get a notice on my computer saying "Fax REceived"<br />
<br />
Alternatively is there any program that I can use to view these faxes? When I try to open them (they are tif files) Windows uses Photoshop to try to open them, and I can then only see the first page of the fax.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on this...

            Hi answers name,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Forum.<br />
<br />
Do you receive any error message with any error code?<br />
<strong><br />
In the meantime perform the following steps to check the relevant permissions:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1. Open Windows Explorer, right-click Start, and then click Explore.<br />
<br />
2. In the left pane, click the disk that contains the operating system.<br />
<br />
3. On the toolbar, click Organize, click Folder and Search Options, click the View tab, and then click Show Hidden Files and Folders. Close the dialog box.<br />
<br />
4. In Windows Explorer, navigate to %systemdrive%\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\Inbox.<br />
<br />
5. Right-click the Inbox folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.<br />
<br />
6. Ensure that the folder has Write permissions for the Network Service account and the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />
Please follow the above steps to check if these faxes have the appropriate permissions.<br />
<strong><br />
<br />
If you aren't set up to receive faxes automatically, Windows notifies you during each incoming call. To answer the call as a fax:</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Fax and Scan.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. To use Fax view, click Fax at the bottom of the left pane.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. On the toolbar, click Receive a Fax Now. The Fax Status Monitor displays the progress of the fax.<br />

            I did not receive an error code.<br />
<br />
I followed your suggestions regarding permissions.<br />
When I get to Step 6, this is what I see:<br />
<br />
Under Group or User Names - the two groups there are "Administrators" or "Fax"<br />
Both of these groups have write permission.<br />
<br />
My computer already receives faxes automatically.<br />

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Did you see if the Network Service has Write permissions as stated in Step 6?<br />
<br />
Thanks,

            Hi Marilyn,<br />
When I click on the "Security Tab", I see the following:<br />
***********<br />
Object Name: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\Inbox<br />
<br />
Group or user names:<br />
&nbsp; Administrators (KEVIN-DESKTOP\Administrators)<br />
&nbsp; Fax<br />
********<br />
<br />
If I highlight either group or user name, I see that the user has "Allow" check for each option below, except special permissions, which is neither allowed or denied.<br />
<br />
I do not see "Nework Service" where would i see this?<br />

<p>Had the same problem and after God knows how long decided that the root of the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;must be within Windows Fax &amp; Scan itself. And it was.</p>
<p>Here is what I found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In Windows Fax and Scan program go to "Tools"</p>
<p>2. Click on Fax Accounts - do you see anything there? If not you need to:</p>
<p>3. Click "Add" and follow set up.</p>
<p>That solved the problem and all faxes are showing now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>I am facing the same problem and I have added the network services to the list and restarted the PC and the inbox is still not working.</p>

<p>Currently "Fax", "Network Service" and administrators have all permissions in the security tab.</p>

            Hi Knight,<br />
<br />
On behalf of Marilyn, do you have Blackberry desktop manager software installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
If there is, temporarily disable or <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall</a> it for test purpose.<br />
<br />
Also perform clean boot on your computer and check if that helps.<br />

            <p>If you open Windows Fax and Scan and click on Tools then Fax Accounts, there is an option to Remove any listed Accounts.&nbsp; After you have done that you could set up another Account.</p>
<p>You could try unchecking Windows Fax and Scan&nbsp; via Control Panel/ Programs and Features/ Turn Windows Features on or off/&nbsp; Print and Documents Services/&nbsp; Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; This will uninstall it.&nbsp; You then reboot and then reverse the steps to reinstall

                    I had a similar problem when doing a full backup to DVD from Vista Home Premium before I did the upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; After several minutes of repeated error messages "Windows backup needs a CD/DVD or USB drive to continue. Insert the required
 one." and "The media in the drive is a previous backup media." (of course it is, it is the first disk in this backup!).&nbsp; Backup under Vista finally realized that the DVD still had to have the format finalized (using write once only), so it finalized and then
 the disk finally ejected.&nbsp; So under Vista, my pre-upgrade full backup was successfully completed.&nbsp; Now under Windows 7, the 1st disk is still in the DVD drive and I am stuck.&nbsp; It will not finalize the completed first disk, and willl not let me eject it until
 that is done.&nbsp; It will not manually eject and Backup just continues with the 2 error messages -- "Windows backup needs a CD/DVD or USB drive to continue. Insert the required one." and "The media

            Very frustrating - I experienced this once with Vista. The only thing I was able to do was to shut down the computer and use a paper-clip in the front of the drive door t get it to open and remove the disk. Had to start the whole procedure over, and the
 second time it ran fine.

<h2>            Is my BF spying on me&#63;</h2>
                    I think my boyfriend has put spyware on my computer that tells him when I log onto my computer and what I do.&nbsp; How can I check?

<p>You could do a general security check:<br />
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</p>
<p>Depending on how good the spyware is, it might elude detection. As an example: He could have created a scheduled task that sends him an email note once a day containing your log-on and log-off time. Easy to write, difficult to detect. To be absolutely sure
 you would need to ditch your boyfriend and reload Windows.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop photos on my PC from showing up on my surface&#63;</h2>
                    On my PC, the picture library just shows my default picture library. &nbsp;When I view pictures on my Surface, EVERY picture shows up. &nbsp; I have some libraries I prefer to keep private, thus the&nbsp;separate&nbsp;library. &nbsp;Why does the Surface override the settings on
 my PC and how do I stop it?

            The library and folders underneath are not shared and permissions are locked down to only my account. &nbsp;There shouldn't be any reason for those folders to be showing up,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;since they don't show up on the PC under pictures.

            <p>Hmmm. Are you using a homegroup? On your PC right click on your Pictures library and see what locations are included in your Pictures library.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you're in the Photos app on Surface the pictures that&nbsp;you don't want to see show up under the name of your PC?</p>

            <p>Can other PCs see the images in the Photos app&nbsp;- (assuming you have another laptop). There aren't any settings in the Photos app - so to fix this, you'll probably need to make a change on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not using a Homegroup, I'm surprised the images show up on Surface. Sorry I&nbsp;don't know more about the Photos app and sharing folders - you might ask about this in the Windows 8 forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the Windows 8 page on file sharing:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/share-files-folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/share-files-folders</a></p>
<p>There may be a troubleshooting link off of this content as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>You need to purchase a genuine Windows 7 license. The copy of Windows 7 Home Premium you have installed is an OEM SLP license that should only come preloaded with a new PC. You seem to have installed a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium that uses an activation
 exploit that circumvents product activation.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The reason we know this is because your BIOS date does not match up:</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>2008</strong>0811000000.000000</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Windows 7 was released in 2009, your BIOS date says <strong>2008</strong>, which likely means your system either came with Windows Vista or Windows XP.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Also, this is a well known Windows 7 Home Premium license that has been used all over the web:</p>
<p>Windows Product Key: *****-*****-QCPVQ-KHRB8-RMV82</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Do a web search.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>So, you either need to reload the copy of Windows that came on your computer (Vista or XP) or consider purchasing a genuine Windows 7 license.</p>

<h2>            kdcom.dll is corrupt after 2&#47;14 update</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 professional. After the automatic update that was installed on 2/14, I started to bluescreen, particularly when waking up from hibernation. The crash report indicates that kdcom.dll is corrupt.<br />
<br />
I tried some system-restores which failed, so I formatted my C: drive and did a fresh install of Windows 7. Everything was fine until 133 updates were installed, then the same crashes started again. I plan and re-reinstalling windows 7 and turning off automatic
 updates as there seems to be an issue with the latest one. My computer is home-built, I7 990extreme chip, Asus MB, and a Nvidia GTX560 GPU.<br />
<br />
The crash/recovery report contained this:<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation - I have put in my Skype address and the password that I use for this account.&nbsp; The password did not work, so I created a new password in microsoft.&nbsp; I did not know that skype and microsoft had merged as its been a long time that I used Skype.&nbsp;
 Anyways, I went back to signing into Skype with this new password, but it would not allow me in.&nbsp; Now what?&nbsp;
