<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Charging Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>So I've had a Surface Pro 4 for a while now. It's been fantastic, but recently, my charger broke, and I wasn't able to use it for a few days. The error was with the cord being broken, nothing wrong with the Surface in that case.
</p>
<p>I recently got a new charger, which seems to be working incorrectly. When I plug it in, the light on the charger end is solid. My surface was at around 0%, so I shut down my Surface and let it charge for about an hour, and then I started it up again without
 unplugging it. My Surface was charged to 60% after that, however, it says it is not charging(the plug logo to the left of the battery logo is not there), and the battery has been steadily declining, at 53% now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current state of the problem:</p>
<p>The Surface is behaving as if it is unplugged and is losing power, despite the charging cord being plugged in and lighting up.</p>
<p>Also, the Surface charges while it is shut down.</p>
<p>Another thing I've noticed, when I take the charger out and put it back in, the plug logo appears for a second, says "not charging", and after that second returns to the unplugged battery state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can fix this and get my Surface to charge normally?</p>

<h2>            Audio</h2>
                    <p>We're back to the same story as always. The music comes out LOUD AS POSSIBLE and the talking bits are just barely a whisper. This makes watching movies not fun on the computer. I already tried updating my audio drives and the company that makes them has
 failed, miserably, to put out Windows 10 drivers and these sound cards are less than a year old. There is no reason for support to have been stopped. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Everything was fine under 8 but now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, they are VIA HD audio cards.</p>

            <p>Howdy - Windows Audio quality guy here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like there's a problem with an audio enhancement. Can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click speaker icon next to clock | Playback devices | Double-click the playback device in question | Look for a tab named "Enhancements" or something similar</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Via's enhancements aren't working, you can try installing the Microsoft High Definition Audio class driver as laid out here:
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/mediaq/archive/2015/07/30/windows_2d00_10_2d00_audio_2d00_troubleshooting_2d00_tips.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Once the class driver is installed, there will be an Enhancements tab with a "Loudness Equalization" checkbox. If you check it, that should even out the difference between the loud parts and the soft parts.</p>

            Alas, I have already been to iBuyPower and for this model, which is less than a year old, they have not updated our drivers to 10 yet. They are still 8.1. I know that that is still interchangeable, and I have tried reinstalling the 8.1 drivers, but am
 still having the same issue. Low talking, loud noise and music. :(

            I'm not going to say that this has resolved all of my issues, but the inbox driver seems to have resolved them. However, as we all know, first appearances in Windows can be deceiving. So, if all holds true for the next day or two, I will come back and
 let everyone know, by then I should be able to discern whether or not the problem is fixed. :) Thanks for everyone's help.

<p>
</p><p>No it has not been resolved. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>

            <p>Exactly, on the console go to his Bio and select File Complaint then follow the instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if the person has made death threats to you then you should consider contacting your local authorities to file a complaint. &nbsp;Make sure you have screen shots of the messages from the person before you block them though as you will no longer have access to those messages after that.</p>
<p>The police will be able to get all the information on the person from Microsoft after a complaint is filed.</p>

    <title>Titanfall Atlas headset - microphone not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> savage baird le  say:</h3>
<h2>            Titanfall Atlas headset - microphone not working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Xbox One forumers! I just picked up this headset and I love it. Got it set up fine, game audio sounds great, but my voice is not being picked up (green circle isn't going off in party). I do have the controller and adapter updated so I don't think that
 is the issue. I would greatly appreciate some help!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Well, I figured out with a friend that it switches from Kinect voice chat to my mics voice chat when I boot up a game. Basically, my mic doesn't work when I'm not playing an actual game (even with Kinect chat off), but then does work upon immediately booting
 up let's say Dead Rising 3. </p>
<p>Kinda strange.</p>

<p>They are supposed to have the whole party chat issues fixed by Tuesday when Titanfall releases. &nbsp;I bought the Titanfall Atlas as well as I felt it was just the right thing to do so it would go with my TF controller. &nbsp;However, I do get some crackling here
 and there with game/music audio but I know that it is the adapter because the headset works just fine on my PC and 360.</p>

<p>Oooh I want the Titanfall controller so bad lol. I hear the cracking when navigating dashboard menus but that is with the adapter like you said. &nbsp;Overall, I'm pretty happy and I cannot wait for Titanfall on Tuesday!</p>

 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp;

<p>I share games with my friend. He bought RDR2 Ultimate Version from Microsoft store. I play his digital copy without having bought it myself. My first thought was, that only one of us gets the bonuses, because one purchase = one bonus content. But as you
 can see on the pic above, i got and installed all of the bonus content. And it worked with the pre-order bonuses (i didn't check the special edition content though).</p>

As long as you've installed the content, you should have access to it regardless of game share. If you've followed the step by step guide to receiving the content and still have no access, I would recommend you raise a support ticket with Rockstar.&nbsp;

<h2>            Restore Local Settings Folder - Win 7 64</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Win 7 64 from XP 64. &nbsp;Tried to access the Local Settings folder, only to receive the access denied message. &nbsp;When it was found the folder held no data, it was deleted. &nbsp;Later, it was realized the folder was a junction folder. &nbsp;Is it possible
 to restore it?

            <p><span>Hi vader,</span></p>
<p><span>Local Settings is a junction point: a hidden, protected operating system file not meant to be accessed by users.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>It points to this user-accessible folder: C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>As was in XP Pro the Document and Settings folder in windows7 does not give access to any user,
 as it is a protected folder. The folder you are talking about has now been replaced in Windows7 with the USERS folder. Under this folder you will get the specific users folders and the documents and folders you need.
</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the following link to access the old files and folders after upgrading to Windows 7 from previous
 version of Windows.</span></p>

            Thanks for taking the time to respond. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that doesn't quite answer my question. &nbsp;Allow me to explain what took place in a bit more detail.
<div>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned before, I tried to access Local Settings and got the access denied message. &nbsp;This was before I knew Local Settings was now in AppData\Local.</li><li>I checked permissions and my username was greyed out but had check marks next to everything under Allow except special permissions.</li><li>I spoke to my network administrator and asked him to login as an admin so that he could check my permissions on the folder.</li><li>He did, checked the permissions and everything for my username was the same as I had seen it when I checked earlier.</li><li>He then tried to assign ownership of the folder to me, but the only available option was admin. &nbsp;He selected that, but the process never completed, so he quit that dialogue box. &nbsp;He then discovered that Local Settings now resided in AppData\Local, noticed
 the Local Settings folder was empty and decided to delete it. &nbsp;He was not aware at the time that it was a junction folder.</li><li>Afterward, I did some reading on the Local Settings folder and discovered it was a junction folder and that it did need to be there.</li><li>I then opened all of the programs I use on a daily basis and checked my user folder again. &nbsp;The Local Settings folder is back now (as if it got created when needed?), but the icon is not the same as before and now I can access it without getting the 'access
 denied' message. &nbsp;Inside this folder are two folders:<br />
Temp<br />
Application Data</li><li>Inside Application Data, there is a folder for only one of my programs and that is AutoDesk 3ds Max 2009.</li></ul>
<div>I hope this helps better illustrate everything that took place. &nbsp;With this information in mind, I have a few more questions:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>How was my network admin able to delete the folder if it is protected? &nbsp;Or does protected mean protected from access and not from deletion?</li><li>Is the new version of the folder that got created the same as what is was before, or is it something different, since it's not behaving quite as it should? &nbsp;Should there even be items in there?</li><li>The owner of the folder is listed as the admin, so it seems to me that his taking ownership may have succeeded. &nbsp;Should I give ownership back to myself?</li><li>Although this may be a separate question, I'll ask as I wonder if its related; When I Open or Save in 3ds Max, I get an old version of the dialog box that doesn't show the places bar that I see in other applications. &nbsp;By that I mean, it doesn't show a button
 for Recent Places, Desktop, Libraries, Computer, and Network. &nbsp;Is the lack of those buttons a result of messing with the Local Settings folder or is it unrelated?</li></ol>

<p>Hello Engelsen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having no trouble what so ever downloading any other apps from the windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only recent change I have made is a system restore moving back 2 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only error I'm receiving is windows store saying, "iHeartRadio is not currently available"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done any trouble shooting because no one except for me seems to have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Alex.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>            XBox Game Pass auf Windows 10 &#91;Translation - Xbox Game Pass on Windows 10&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,</p>
<p>ich suche grade eine Liste, bei der ich alle Spiele sehe, welche ich mit dem Game Pass "kostenlos" über Windows 10 spielen kann.</p>
<p>Entweder finde ich eine Liste alle Play Anywhere Titel oder alle Spiele, die ich mit dem Game Pass spielen könnte, die aber nur für die XBox gelten.</p>
<p>Über die XBox App werden mir zum Beispiel (Microsoft Store -&gt; XBox Game Pass) Rocket League oder The Division angezeigt. Diese kann ich aber nur kaufen bzw reduziert kaufen.</p>
<p>Forza Motorsport 7 oder Horizon 3 sind jedoch nicht mit drin. Was irgendwie der Beschreibung (<span>Der Xbox Game Pass ist ein Dauerauftrag für Xbox One-Spiele und abwärtskompatible Titel für Xbox Play Anywhere und Xbox 360)
 widerspricht. Beides sind aber Play Anywhere Titel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Danke und gute Nacht.</span></p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass on Windows 10 Hi,</p>
<p>I'm looking for a list of all the games I can play with the game Pass ' free ' on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Either I find a list of all the play anywhere titles or all the games I could play with the game pass, but that only apply to the Xbox.</p>
<p>For example, the Xbox app shows me (Microsoft Store-&gt; Xbox game pass) Rocket League or the division. However, I can only buy or buy this reduced.</p>
<p>However, Forza Motorsport 7 or Horizon 3 are not included in the game. What somehow contradicts the description (the Xbox game Pass is a standing order for Xbox One games and backward compatible titles for Xbox play anywhere and Xbox 360). But both are play
 anywhere titles.</p>
<p>Thank you and good night.]</p>

    <title>Kernel Security Check Failure with Razer Abyssus mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cappy_bara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernel Security Check Failure with Razer Abyssus mouse</h2>
                    So, on occasion (About 50% of the time) when I plug in my Razer Abyssus mouse, I get a BSOD with the Kernel_Security_Check_Failure immediately upon plugging it in. This has only started happening when I installed the Drivers for the Abyssus from Razer's
 website. I figured this was the issue, so I took my steps to remove the program. I used the basic uninstall programs provided with Win 8, followed by a search (Including hidden folders and files) of the computer with anything involving the name Abyssus (Such
 as Abyssus.sys), followed by digging through my registry and deleting the&nbsp;<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\abyssus
</b>registry entry, and restarted. I figured this would have solved the problem by utilizing the basic mouse drivers, but it still BSOD's when I plug it in. Any ideas?

            Solved the problem myself. Found out about the v2.00 drivers, and the 2.02 drivers (which is specifically for windows 8) dowload the drivers, run CCleaner to fix up registry, install driver, restart, no more bluescreen.

 in my downloads but all new downloads do not go there.&nbsp; Also how do you download from mail, it only gives save as option and that saves to downloads but when I open it, it opens in mail as eml file. not very pleased with this upgrade.</p>

            Hi Cynde, it is normal for Device Manager to show 4 processors if you have a quad core processor - what model of processor is reported in Device Manager?
<br />
<br />For example I have a Quad Core Processor with Hyperthreading which gives 8 cores, see the pic below:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71c2752e-5e74-4265-a807-cbe4e09ba640?upload=true" />

            Hi Cynde, yes that processor is dual core with hyperthreading and that will then show as 4 processors in Device Manager . . .
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />On the performance Tab, right click the Processor graph and choose 'Change Graph to - Logical Processors'
<br />
<br />There you will see the 4 threads on your Processor<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0cc2283-8ed9-414c-ab69-d662932d742a?upload=true" />

<p>Thanks for responding, Bruce. But, I found a very simple answer in a reply to a similar&nbsp;question in this forum. Since I still have an XP Pro PC, I was able to copy the appropriate files from the Windows XP System 32 folder onto a thumb drive and then put
 the files in a new folder on my Win 7 PC.</p>
<p>Here are the file names:</p>
<p>cards.dll, freecell.exe, sol.exe, mshearts.exe, spider.chm, spider.exe, spider.hlp, and winimine.exe.</p>
<p>Actually, I think cards.dll and sol.exe would have been sufficient, as the other files pertain to other games.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

    <title>BSOD unexpected store exception. Stuck on Surface UEFI screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaynenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD unexpected store exception.  Stuck on Surface UEFI screen</h2>
                    <p>My surface laptop model 1769 has blue screened with the error message unexpected store exception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it restarted, it went to the Surface UEFI screen.&nbsp; I tried Exiting and restarting it, but it kept coming back to that screen again.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that going into "security"and change secure boot configuration and setting it to "none" might help the issue, so I tried this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seemed to work and I did some updates on it.&nbsp; I noticed that some drivers didn't install properly, but couldn't see any way to reinstall them or try again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 days later the blue screen with the same error message came back (today), now it's continuously stuck going to the Surface UEFI screen, even if I try re-enabling and disabling the secure boot.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to do anything anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help??&nbsp; I don't know what to do and have lots of work and projects due!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would rather not loose everything on my laptop but can't even get in there to save and back things up.&nbsp; Most things are backed up already, but there are some things that aren't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello JayneNZ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having a start-up failures and now stuck on Surface UEFI screen on your Surface Laptop. We'd like to confirm if you see a
<span><span><span>SSD Status Icon </span></span></span><span>in the top right corner of the UEFI screen. If the
</span><span>UEFI displays a boot drive error icon, </span><span>it is likely that the motherboard is unable to see a hard drive and may need to have it serviced.
<br />
<br />
If there's no icon present on the UEFI screen, try to do a force shutdown on your Surface to
</span><span><span><span>completely turn off all power and restart. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Press and hold the
<strong>Power</strong><strong> button</strong> for 20 seconds. </span></span></span><span>The Surface may boot to UEFI and just exit it. If the issue occurs after the performing the forced shut down, then you may need to restore it to its factory settings using
 the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">recovery image</a></strong>. This reset process will
</span>delete all of your personal files, resets your settings, and removes all apps that you installed. You can read more information on how to create and use USB recovery drive

<p>Hi thanks for your reply, yes there is an icon on the top right corner, with an "x" in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My surface laptop is under a year old and is still under warranty, the only issue is that I'm overseas in France at the moment and won't be back to New Zealand where I bought it for another couple of months.&nbsp; I am working from overseas so need my laptop
 to be able to work.&nbsp; Is it possible to have it fixed or replaced under warranty in France?&nbsp; Or is it only valid in New Zealand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Intermittent black screen - somewhat random</h2>
                    <p>Dell laptop with Intel HD Graphics 620 with LG Ultrawide HDMI monitor. HDMI cables swapped/checked, drivers updated/rolled back and updated again etc. Happens more when watching video and even more when watching video and using Bluetooth out (i.e. taxing
 the graphics chip seems to make it happen more - hence 'somewhat' random). It does happen without taxing graphics but not as often. When watching video (typically youtube) it might do it so often that it is not even worth using! Does not do it with the Tried
 many other things - to many to list (and remember). Didn't happen when I first bought the LG&nbsp; - something changed - not sure what. Has been happening for months now - still working on it....&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            ISD Tablet - Wacom Technology Removal Requirement</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am new to this but didn't see the answer to my questions on this form. Why does the Windows 10 update require the uninstalling of Wacom technology? I have Wacom software version 7.0.2-24 (ISD Tablet is the program and Wacom is the publisher). I saw some
 tutorials online on how to make a Backup of the wacom settings so that when it is reinstalled than it can be used easily, but I don't see why it needs to be uninstalled in the first place. And I am not wanting to lose this technology as it works really well
 on my computer, which has Windows 7 Professional installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this is not particularly helpful.&nbsp; These Lenovo computers are tablet computers with Wacom tablet technology built into the tablet screen.&nbsp; Having a working compatible ISD Tablet Wacom driver is essential to maintaining the essential drawing
 capability of the computer.&nbsp; It's not something that can be left to chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked other forums and there are many people affected by this (these, and similar HP Touchsmart computers were very popular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft is promoting Windows 10 as an upgrade from Windows 7 Professional, it should work with major suppliers such as Wacom and Lenovo to ensure these drivers are compatible.&nbsp; Without assurances that there will be a working driver I can't upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
