<h2>            My Home Xbox</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have an urgent problem. I have a friend that shared his account with me in my xbox one(we, are from the same place, region, etc)and I tried to put his account as my home xbox, the problem is that when I tried it, my xbox&nbsp;said that "it can't be my home xbox&nbsp;-&nbsp;it have to be just one as principal...etc". I have two accounts more and they're not as my home xbox.</p>

<p>I tried to leave that behind but I download a game from his account and I can't play that game if he is not online in my xbox....</p>

<p>What can I do?</p>

<p>Phone support right now and get an unauthorised access investigation opened. It'll take some time to get your account back you (up to 30 days) but your account will be locked off and unusable during that time so that's a plus point. Also if you had credit
 cards stored on that account get in touch with whoever issued them to you so they can watch for any dodgy transactions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you're waiting review just how secure your password was, check anywhere you used the same e-mail/password combination for signs of intrusion (Amazon, Play etc) and look into setting up a WLID that's just for your XBL account.</p>

<p><i><span>Perhaps you should stop CHEATING. A quick Google search of your allegedly hacked account pulls up an interesting post in TTG where you are hosting a modded zombie lobby as recently as May 2011.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>When you associate yourself with modders/cheaters you leave yourself open to attack by the very crowd you participate in. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if it was one of your fellow TTG
 members who compromised your account. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>Anyway, follow the advice above. Oh, and stop CHEATING. People like you don't deserve to use XBL.

<p><i><span>As it is your current account also has associations with the modding world. I can foresee you posting in the MY LIVE ACCOUNT WAS SUSPENDED forum in regards to both accounts in the near future.<br />

<p>I believe you CAN be hacked. &nbsp;Microsoft just doesn't want to admit they aren't that good at preventing it. &nbsp;Microsoft is a big joke. They have more security getting access to your account via their support # than they do at preventing hackers! &nbsp;And all of
 their responses to posts are smart @@@ answers! &nbsp;PS3 is way better...never have any problems with them.</p>

<p>Actually no QuickAttendant2, with the all of the security codes and other firefox security blocking hacking from accounts, it's impossible for someone to get hacked unless they are PHISHED. Which means somebody tempts a user into giving them personal information.
 Also, if your on your way to PS3, please don't disrupt anybody on the way and close the door very quitely. Thank you.

<p>Original Colton...wake up! &nbsp;Anything can be hacked and you are ignorant to believe Xbox can't. &nbsp;That's part of the problem there...denial. &nbsp;BTW, maybe you should learn to read...where did I say I was on my way to PS3...already have it, don't have to go there.
</p>
<p>FannyPackNinja, umm..yep, no problems...don't get suspended without warning for 'allegedly' cheating/hacking/whatever excuse Xbox wants to use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny how PS3 can get hacked but not Microsoft...go figure. &nbsp;Microsoft programmers should be over our government's security if that's the case.</p>

<p><i><span>You say you never had any problems with the PSN? So when MILLIONS of PSN customers couldn't access the PSN network because it was HACKED, not once or twice, but several times, you had no problems?
 Interesting. So while millions of PSN customers weren't able to use their PS3 online YOU were able to with no problems at all, even though Sony shut it down. Maybe you should work for our governments security.<br />
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>While it is a fact that nothing is 100% hack proof, it is also a fact that account security is EVERYONE'S responsibility. It is up to the company providing the service to make sure our account
 information is safe and secure, which by the way Microsoft does do, and it is up to the account holder to keep their account information safe and secure, which millions of people do not do.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>1)They willingly hand over their account log in to the first person who says they can rank them up to the top without all the effort or they can unlock all weapons and camos or whatever else
 they can do. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span>2)Or they visit a phishing website and get their account information stolen that way because they use the same e-mail address and password that they use for XBL for every single website/service
 they use instead of having a seperate one for XBL. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span>3)Or they are socially engineered through normal everyday conversation where an unscrupulous person acts like he is just engaging in chit chat but is really gathering information about you to
 steal your account. ALL of the aforementioned is the USERS FAULT. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>And people aren't suspended or banned from XBL 'for no reason'. There is a reason, they just play dumb about it because they thought they were smarter than MS and wouldn't get caught. MS knows
 all and sees all on their network.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>Microsoft can get hacked just like any other company/website/service, to deny that would be ridiculous. BUT they do a better job than most at keeping our personal information safe and secure.
 If they didn't they would have been hacked by now and that just isn't the case. Maybe MS should handle our governments security, they couldn't do an worse a job than what is already being done.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people do not want to be suspended or banned for 'no reason' then they really should take the time to actually read and follow the XBL Terms of Service, Xbox.com Terms of Use and Code of Conduct. All of those contracts that everyone must agree to in order
 to access XBL tell us what can and can not be done with the hardware, software and service whilst we are using it.</p>

====================================<br />
The only version of XP Movie Maker&nbsp;that has an option to<br />
burn a DVD is the Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005...<br />
is that the version you are running? <br />
<br />
Regardless...you may have a better result if you save your<br />
Movie Maker project in the .wmv or .avi format and use 3rd <br />
party DVD Authoring software to create your Video DVD.. <br />
<br />
The following freeware may be worth a try:<br />

<br />
To create a basic Video DVD that should play in a free<br />
standing DVD player...try the following...<br />
<br />
First...read the DVD Flick Guide to familiarize yourself<br />
with the program.<br />
<br />
Open DVD Flick and insert a blank DVD in your burner.<br />
<br />
If your computer's Autoplay window opens....just close it.<br />
<br />
Click the Project Settings button and go to...Video /<br />
Target format...residents of USA...choose...NTSC /<br />
Accept.<br />
<br />
Left click the Add title button and browse to your<br />
Movie Clips and select the ones you want on the DVD.<br />
<br />
You can arrange them by selecting one and then use<br />
the Move Up and Move Down buttons.<br />
<br />
Left click the Create DVD button / OK / Yes / Yes.<br />
<br />
Wait while the DVD is created.<br />
<br />
When the text "Finished Successfully" appears you<br />
may close DVD Flick. Now you can eject your DVD<br />
and play it in your DVD player.<br />
<br />
At some point you may wish to purchase more<br />
advanced software like Cyberlink, Nero, Roxio,<br />
Ulead, etc...but at least this is a start.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to allow a program to run under a standard user account without an admin password&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There's a program called iCool i have installed that enables the system to increase or decrease the speed of the CPU fan according to how much stress its under.&nbsp; The problem I'm having is when my nephew tries to run it in his Standard User account, it always
 asks for an admin password.&nbsp; Is there a way to get it to run without asking for the password?&nbsp; I want it to do what it does in my Admin account:&nbsp; ask me whether or not I wish the program to run, but without asking for a password - just a simple yes or no click!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank in advance for any help . :)</p>

<p>It appears that your program performs some restricted operation that requires admin privileges. You would have to turn off UAC (User Access Control) to allow ordinary users to run this program, thus bypassing the protective measures that are implemented
 in Windows 7.</p>
<p>Note also that most machines built after the year 2000 use a sensor that automatically increases the fan speed as the CPU temperature increases.</p>

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed<br />
hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see<br />
if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run<br />
hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's<br />
manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so,<br />
contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system<br />
startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system<br />
choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong><br />
option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it<br />
does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must<br />
restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for<br />
problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the<br />
device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<p>I would suggest to first update the Netgear wireless adapter driver.</p>
<p>That should solve the blue screen issue.</p>
<p>Then treat the failed updates as a separate issue and start a new topic on the issue in the&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update</a> forum.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - folders do not save the customized properties view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpilson21bh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - folders do not save the customized properties view</h2>
                    <p>Major nuance. Have a huge library of ripped music CDs (converted to mp3 files) on external hard drive. I like to right click on each folder, select properties, customize, and have each folder display the album artwork. See image below....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since converting
 from WinXP to Windows 7 a couple years ago, Windows 7 will not permanently save these settings. The folders abruptly and without warning return to a default view, which is driving me crazy. It worked fine in WinXP.</p>
<p>How do I apply the customized view in Windows 7 to these folders - and have it be permanent?</p>
<p>In screenshot below, I am trying to setup each folder to look like the folder shown to far right, where ONLY the album artwork is visible. (I use large icons for all of these folders.) Windows 7 allows me to do this, but what I keep running into is that
 something is undoing this, so I get folders like you see to the left as the default view instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc158e4c-62a4-4c00-b547-089b9a441884" /></p>
<p>I should mention - this screenshot shows the subfolders for the Foreigner folder. So this problem affects subfolders as well.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure about this, but I know of one alternative.&nbsp; Inside the Music library (not folder, but specifically the library), you can use the "arrange by" menu at the top-right and arrange by album.&nbsp; This view will be preserved, plus it also makes the album
 art shown in the entirety.</p>

            Thanks, but doesn't solve finding source of problem nor is that&nbsp;a true resolution. Don't know about others, but I find the Windows "library" is another nuance in itself. Best to stay away from. Have always had entire mp3 collection on external hard drive
 - for all ripping and CD burning. And works well for Winamp, which is my default music player. Repeating problem: I change the default folder view on folders and subfolders on external hard drive, to a jpg image of album artwork located within each folder.
 It initially looks fine after doing this, but after a day or a few days, something is changing it. See screenshot in my original post. In WinXP, this always worked fine without problems. This problem exists for Windows 7. In the control panel folder options,
 recently changed the folder settings back to default settings, and testing to see if that does anything. Otherwise, still stuck on this issue.

            <p>I don't know why you find libraries a nuisance, they are quite amazing. But I know you aren't here to debate which organization system you use, so let's see about those folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suspect that media player is perhaps the culprit, adding album art by injecting a hidden
<em>folder.jpg </em>into the folder, or changing the hidden <em>desktop.ini</em> file that is inside the folder (which is where your preferred image setting is stored).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporarily, go to folder options and turn on the display of hidden files and also "protected operating system files", and you should see a desktop.ini file in each folder.&nbsp; Your customized folder should look something like this, if you open that desktop.ini
 file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ce0f305-693e-495a-be75-7a516f4c0d4c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suspect is that this file is being modified, or perhaps deleted, thus resetting your folder view to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, you might try a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>See if you can turn off any library management tools in your Media Player programs.&nbsp; iTunes, Windows Media, etc. all usually have these.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Try setting the desktop.ini file as read-only so it can't be modified.</li></ol>

            <p>Thx for this reply.</p>
<p>Even when choosing to display all hidden files, there is not a desktop.ini file in any of these folders or subfolders. And all folders and subfolders are already marked as read-only.&nbsp;Course, there are thousands of them, impossible to test every single one.
 But in the test I just did, that was the pattern I see. Winamp is set as the default player for all audio and mp3 files. I do not use iTunes, and only use Windows Media Player for video. I do not use the Winamp embedded library, I add files manually to the
 Winamp playlist or just click on the mp3 file directly, which opens and plays that file in Winamp.</p>

            <p>Are you sure there is no desktop.ini file?&nbsp; It would be impossible to have your settings without it.&nbsp; But keep in mind that you can't view it until you turn off
<em>both</em> the "show hidden files", <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and also</span> the "hide protected operating system files" box.&nbsp; Unless you do both, you'll not see it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Media Player could also still be the culprit, even if you only use it for watching video.&nbsp; Make sure that this option is off:</p>

            <p>Got it. OK, yes I now see the desktop.ini files within each folder. (There is also a "thumbs" file in each folder.) I do not understand how to make these files read-only however. The setting you allude to in Windows Media Player is off.&nbsp; Also, since hitting
 the setting to "reset all folders" in control panel, the folders that I have redone using jpg image as the default view have held up so far. Did a few to test, and this goes back at least 3 or 4 days. The folders in which I changed the default view are holding
 up so far. (Control panel, folder options, view/reset&nbsp;folders.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just found - that when I turned the folder view settings OFF for showing all files, (and I turned HIDE operating system files back on)&nbsp;some of the subfolders I am testing - lost the default view. Perhaps that sheds some light on this? But curiously,
 it didn't affect ALL of the subfolders, only some of them. Still, this has to be a clue as to what is going on.</p>

            <p>That is interesting.&nbsp; I would dig in and see if the folders that lost the picture have a picture listed insider their desktop.ini file still.&nbsp; If the picture is no longer listed in there, that's the cause.&nbsp; If the picture file is listed... the mystery would
 deepen because we are back to not knowing why it isn't showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, to make it read-only, I would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Music folder</li><li>In the search box, search for "desktop.ini"</li><li>Select all of them, right-click, choose Properties.</li><li>Turn on the "read only' checkbox to prevent future changes to the file</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>

            <p>Jpg file still in all of those subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read-only: I am following your directions, but don't see that the changes are permanent. Example, steps 1 thru 3 work fine. Step 4: When I check the box for read-only and hit apply to change all of those desktop.ini files, there is a long pause. Then I hit
 OK. I don't see any change though. And right clicking on these desktop.ini files after the fact, under properties, shows they are still not read-only for some reason. (Read-only checkbox not checked.) It's as if something is blocking them from changing to
 read-only. Unless I am doing something wrong in your step 4, don't think I am tho.</p>

            the destruction of folder views is caused by autodiscovery, <br />
this is a privacy and security issue,<br />
I do not want anyone seeing what pics I have just because I happened to navigate into a folder with pics in it.
<br />
there is only one way to kill it and it's with a registry hack <br />
save the the following text as a .reg file and then run it to disable folder auto discovery:<br />
<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags\AllFolders\Shell]<br />

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Steps to check Application Event log:<br />

<p><span>Hi Jrsoccer18 – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
You shall have used Diskparted from Linux or you shall use DBAN instead. <br />
With DBAN you can erase the entire disk driver and zero it on the magnet. <br />
DBAN support DOD (Department of Defense) 5220.22-M standard and of <br />
course the most securely (known to some extent is the) Gutman Wipe method, <br />
delete data from magnetic and solid state memory. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
Anyway, you might need to provide some more details… </span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>

<p>More then likely if your disk has a chip then it is pretty much useless. Personally a disk with a chip in it would not be going in my xbox as it could cause problems with the xbox.

<p>If your game doesnt work when you put it in your xbox, then youll have to get the disc replaced. Most things that go wrong with a disc in the field of chipping, deep scratches, circle scratches, ect, cant be fixed by normal means. I would try trading it
 in towards a new or used copy. However you go about it, if the disc doesnt work, it needs to be replaced.

            &nbsp;Hi,
<ul>
<li>What were the changes made before the issue occured? </li><li>What other troubleshooting steps did you try?</li></ul>
<div>You may refer these steps:</div>
<div><strong>Step A.<br />
</strong>a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Windows 7 will enter Safe mode.<br />
f. Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step B.<br />
</strong>If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.</div>

<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.<br />

<h2>            windows 7 installation 0x80070079 error</h2>
                    Dear Computer Experts,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My specs from what I remember.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>12GB RAM</div>
<div>Quad Core</div>
<div>Thats about it.... I cannot remember any more.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But in a nutshell, I recently purchased a new HDD for my computer. The old one still works it is just maxed (~40 GB left empty), Windows 7 (all patched and updated driver,etc). However I cannot seem to get my new HDD installed with Windows 7 (I am using
 the DVD/CD installer), it is a hit-miss of whether or not the computer boots with the CD (BootMNGR says it is missing), and when it does boot every goes fine (as in I can click the buttons),but when it says "expanding windows files" it hover around 6% then
 gives an error message (0x*0070079) which says the files in question (from the disk) are corrupted(?) (I forgot the exact message)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried using a windows vista installer (CD/DVD) and same result, either cant boot to the optical drive, or stutters at the installation stage.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I am typing this no where near the computer in question, I will post a dxdiag or computer specs as requested.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />

            Hello Frank,
<div><br />
<div>The only other way to install Windows without using the DVD is to use a USB thumb drive that has been properly configured with the Windows installation files on it:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>You would need to do this on a working computer though, so it's not much help if this is your only machine.</div>

<h2>            Compaq laptop screen suddenly begins to rolling  and will continue to do even if I hold down the ctrl.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is Compaq Presario CQ50-210us Notebook PC running Windows VISTA. All support comes from HP. It has developed a mind of its own. The&nbsp;screen starts rolling when it wants. I have no control over it. This happens with already installed HP games, IE9
 and Office. Sometimes I can stop it by holding down the ctril key but once I stop it starts again.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I turn off the laptop and wait to turn it back on it starts rolling and sometimes it does this for over 10-15 minutes. According all updates are in place.
 Any suggestions as it's really annoying? Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before starting the backup, I got a message that about 27GB would be needed.&nbsp; There is over 100GB of free space on the second hard drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suspect that Windows attempted to create an image of the System drive <strong>
and</strong> your backup drive. Rebooting the machine should fix this. If not then a clean boot might be required - see here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135.<br />

            <p>Hi kmay1986,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing those information. I would like to ask what is your operating system and also the version of your Family Safety. To check the version, press
<strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong>, find the version of Windows Essentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we would like you to check the app restrictions of that child account. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. Log in to <a href="https://fss.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://fss.live.com</strong></a></p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Edit Settings</strong> below the account you want to check</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>App restrictions</strong></p>
<p>4. Check the flash player if included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Convert .wma to .mp3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtgjeg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Convert .wma to .mp3</h2>
                    Is it possible to convert .wma files to .mp3 files and keep all of the metadata stored in the WMP library.&nbsp; I have a large music collection (about 75GB).&nbsp; Most of my music is in .wma format.&nbsp; I just got an account with mp3tunes.&nbsp; They only play .mp3 files.&nbsp;
 The problem is that I've been using WMP for a long time now and I have modified a bunch of the metadata associated with the files (mood, genre, sub-genre).&nbsp; When I convert the files to .mp3, that data is lost.&nbsp; Is there another way?

<h2>            Re Closing Account</h2>
                    I read the "answers" to this but it is still unclear to me (due to choice of verbiage I suppose). After the 30 days when the account is deleted, if someone wants to reopen their account- I.E. OPEN AN ACCOUNT AGAIN, will the system allow it? Or does it
 recognize your info (email, name, etc...) and not allow you to "rejoin" Skype?&nbsp;

<h2>            Activate Windows 10 after motherboard Replacement</h2>
                    My old PC failed so I put my hard drive into another PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;Upon booting I get a message to "Activate Windows". My original installation was done online so I don't have Product Key so how do I resolve this without having to buy a new copy?&nbsp;

            Hi, 
<br /> How did you get Windows 10 (or previous Windows version in case of free upgrade) ? 
<br /> If it was preinstalled you have no rights to use it after motherboard replacement unfortunately and need to buy new license.. 
<br /> If you bought Windows in Microsoft Store or in local retail store, please call Microsoft support during work hours and ask a help from support person. And you will need a product key of previous version.

            Hi JG
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence a Retail licence?

            If you use a Microsoft account, you sign in, go to the tab "my devices", unlink your previous device and relink your new device … you can find information at Settings/Account, the device reference at Settings/System/About. Sometimes Microsoft can ask you
 to phone in to verify identity.

            Hi JG
<br />
<br />Great, that means your licence does have transfer rights, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10, they can see into your Microsoft Account and the licence you hold . ..

On that PC with the "Activate Windows" message, sign into the same Microsoft account you associated with the old PC.

If you are a student, you may be eligible for cheaper (or free) Windows 10 product keys through your university.&nbsp;In order to qualify, students need to be attending campuses that have purchased an organization-wide Volume Licensing Program.&nbsp;

    <title>Can&#39;t install any updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heliosvmg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install any updates</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
I'll try to include as much information as possible.<br />
<br />
I'm having serious difficulties installing updates on my computer. First I was getting error 0x80070011 when trying to install KB4056892. The update would reboot the machine, get to ~35%, reboot again, and then rollback the update due to an error. At this point
 the computer reboots several more times and then finally leaves me on the login screen.<br />
The person in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/kb4056892-fails-to-install-with-error-0x80070011/1d285b5b-c12e-48c5-be9e-da3465c58683">
this thread</a> has the exact same symptoms as me. That thread led me to believe I had some sort of corruption in my installation. After trying various methods to attempt to detect/fix the supposed corruption, I decided to just cut my losses and do a full reinstall.
 Now on this fresh installation I'm getting error 0x80240034 when trying to install KB4074588. The symptoms are exactly the same as before; it gets to about 35%, then reboots several times to rollback. I tried running the System File Checker, as suggested in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/windows-update-error-0x80240034/ef877ec1-a3d6-4a4e-a9aa-3ccdf5ff2ff7">
this thread</a>, but no problems were found.<br />
<br />
Now, here's where it gets weird. Before reinstalling I had the foresight to image my SSD with dd, just in case anything went wrong. I just ran this image in VirtualBox and it's able to update itself without any issues! So clearly it's not any sort of corruption
 that's causing the issues. My only is that either some piece of hardware or some driver must be triggering some kind of incompatibility. I looked in the event viewer for any errors, but all I could find was:<br />
<br />
ERROR "Performance power management features on processor # in group 0 are disabled due to a firmware problem. Check with the computer manufacturer for updated firmware."<br />
for each one of my logical cores, which doesn't seem relevant<br />
<br />
WARNING "Intel(R) I211 Gigabit Network Connection - Network link is disconnected."<br />
<br />
My motherboard includes two network adapters and one is disconnected. I tried uninstalling it and disabling installing drivers for it through a group policy, just in case, but this didn't do anything.<br />
<br />
So at this point I'm completely stumped. Any ideas?<br />
