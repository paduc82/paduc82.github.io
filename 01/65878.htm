<h2>            text banned unfairly</h2>
                    I was playing Command and Conquer Kanes Wrath. I created a lobby and waited for players to join. Three people join my four player lobby so I wait for them to ready up. One of them sends me a message asking for teams or not. I reply yes teams the
<strong>[mod removed-profanity]</strong> basically. He replies back no teams are g*y and bo*ing. I then reply back. The teams are better than two people attacking one person. A few minutes into the game I get a enforcement policy and a 2 week chat ban. I'm
 like what. I get a enforcement policy link and read every single rule. I even read. where it says the context matters but apparently it doesn't. Can I get a legit reason why. I was chat banned. When nothing about what I said was offensive or harmful in any
 way. You even have a rule where you encourage competitive but you chat ban me every time over smalls things. If you cared about the context, you would see. I'm mostly the one responding back to negative feedback but somehow I'm the one being reported and banned
 over it.

<h2>            ASUS P5K Motherboard RAM configuration compatibility with Windows 7 &#40;32 bit&#41; clean install.</h2>
                    My desktop is configured with an ASUS P5K motherboard.&nbsp; I currently have 3GB RAM installed. Though a 2005 Intel White Paper regarding "Intel chipset 4GB System Memory Support" shows Windows XP (32 bit) would support 4GB RAM, ASUS recommends 3GB.&nbsp; I've
 recently upgraded (clean install) to Windows 7 thinking that maybe it would support the 4GB configuration.&nbsp; Does anyone have any information as to whether the "new" OS will have any influence on the effective use of, or operating parameters of, Windows 7 on
 the ASUS P5K board?

            Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems will <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">address
</span></strong>no more than 4gb TOTAL.<br />
<br />
When the computer starts,it uses some of the RAM, looks at the motherboard resources, and then ignores any installed RAM which would put it over the 4gb limit. Most motherboards use up around 750mb.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to use more, you will have to switch to using a 64-bit operating system..

<h2>            Country of Device Registration</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a surface pro from the US, but I will be using it in India, where I live. When I am trying to register my device it is asking the country. Which country should I put, and will it make a difference? If so, then how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I put in India, will I still be covered under warranty?&nbsp; Will Microsoft India undertake under warranty repairs here?</p>

<h3> techishcrawford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security Update Win 7 x64 - 800B0100 - KB2978742</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 running x64 on a Compaq CQ57:&nbsp; Security Update&nbsp;KB2978742 yields a 800B0100 corrupt file error code.&nbsp;Yesterday, I succesfully installed 13 updates, however, this one remains.&nbsp; The stored update history shows that this problem with this file began
 on or before May 14,2014 and has continuously existed since.</p>
<p>Last night, I&nbsp;ran, in the elevated console administrative mode, the Win7 versions of &nbsp;MS "Fix it",&nbsp;System Update Readiness and Hotfix, as well as System File Check "sfc /scannow". No errors present in the results&nbsp;and the problem with this stubborn file persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1:&nbsp; Is Installation of This File Necessary&nbsp;since it is&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;one year&nbsp;old?&nbsp; Many security updates have been installed since, the files seem to grow chronologically, so, if they are Cumulative, perhaps I should just uncheck the file and forget it.&nbsp; Perhaps
 it conflicts with a more recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2:&nbsp; If the file is necessary,&nbsp; I believe that I have done everything short of the lengthy command line manual install of this file.&nbsp; However, at my level, I have concerns about forcing it and causing more trouble than existed before.&nbsp; It's a friends computer
 and she leaves in 5 days for 3 months in Baja and needs it for her business operation down there, so I am under a time constraint.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note:&nbsp; She didn't want to bother me with it so, a few weeks back, she took it to OfficeMax and for $250.00 her computer&nbsp;was returned to her running so slowly that it was virtually useless.&nbsp;Of course, I removed all of that, doubled the ram with an additional
 bank to 4Gb, and did a full scan of the drive before I began this.&nbsp; McAffee is the anti-virus, that was preinstalled and remains.&nbsp; Bear in mind that the install error began long before any of that happened, again May of 2014.&nbsp; At this point the performance
 of the unit is better than new (ram, likely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you all for being there, </p>
<p>William</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello William,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts and time towards resolving this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, if there is an issue with the installation of a security update, the probable cause of it is usually the conflict between
 the security program â€“ which is McAffee in your case. You may try to disable the anti-virus and try to install the update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><em>Important Note:</em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</span></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition to that, you may try the following methods.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Clean Boot</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>In clean boot, you can disable the startup items which may be causing this issue. To learn more about clean boot, click on the link below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section â€˜<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>â€™.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to download and install the update manually. To do so, click on the link below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, you may try method 3.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Just block the update and carry on. &nbsp;Windows updates don't actually make your machine more secure. &nbsp;They're just designed to make your machine run progressively slower so that you'll want to go out and buy a new machine. &nbsp;That's why my ten year old laptop
 can run a Linux OS and do it faster than a Windows 8 machine that's less than a year old.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ryan0101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble creating home group when using &#40;2&#41; routers.</h2>
                    Hello everyone, thank you for reviewing my problem is as follows:<br />
<br />
I have three (3) computers that I just upgraded to Windows 7 and am trying to get them to home group together.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The problem I am running into is the fact that my desktop computer is connected to a linksys wireless router.&nbsp; NOTE: The wireless function is disabled, I am only using it as a hub. (My desktop and xbox are hardwired to this)<br />
<br />
Due to poor wireless reception, I have a wireless router I have placed downstairs, this router is hardwired to the linksys hub upstairs.<br />
<br />
So now the desktop computer cannot "see" the wireless computers as they are connected via the wireless network downstairs.&nbsp; Its almost as if the hub upstairs needs to be "invisible".<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you so much!

<blockquote>Ok so I am a little confused, so in my situation would I disable the router DHCP on the upstairs linksys currently being used as just a hub?</blockquote>
<br />
The way I would do it is whatever router is connected to your broadband modem (I am assuming your on broadband cable or DSL ISP) would be Router-1 and have its DHCP server enabled.&nbsp;The other router (Router-2) would be connected to Router-1 LAN-port-2-LAN-port
 and have its DHCP server disabled. Router-2 would also have a LAN IP in the same range as what is used by Router-1. Be careful and make sure the LAN IP you assign to Router-2 is outside the range what the DHCP server on Router-1 assigns, ie. if Router-1 starts
 assigning IP addresses at 192.168.0.100 for example assign Router-2 a LAN IP of 192.168.0.10...<br />
<br />
Make sense? I am off to Super Bowl land and will check back in the morning. If you have further questions post them and either someone else will answer or I will in the morning...

<h2>            Desktop in Windows 10 Changed</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire R7, with Windows 10. I have had no problems with Windows 10, other than that one day when I logged into my PC, my desktop (which had looked normal) switched to looking like this (see below). All of the files that had been on my desktop
 were still saved in a desktop file, but not actually on this new desktop. I added that file and Chrome as apps on the new desktop, but I would really like to have the normal Windows 10 desktop back with all of my files. I tried restoring my computer to a few
 weeks before the change happened, but it did not fix the issue.</p>

            <p>I tried this, and it didn't work. But, when experimenting with the various display settings, I noticed that when I switched to "extend" it would switch back to the correct desktop, then revert back in any of the other settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a little more exploring in Settings, I noticed that my PC was choosing to start in tablet mode. I turned tablet mode off, which didn't work at first. But after restarting and turning it off again, it seems to be back to normal. If not, I now know how
 to fix it.</p>

            Hi  Andjelko,
<br />
<br />You can clone a HDD onto an SSD, if the SSD is of the same or greater size as the HDD. You also need to be able to connect the 2 drives to your PC . . .
<br />
<br />Windows cannot do this for you, it does not have a drive cloning function
<br />
<br />The free Home version of Macrium Reflect will clone that drive for you:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree</a>
<br />
<br />____________________________________________________
<br />
<br />However, since you are replacing your HDD with an SSD your best option is to backup your Data and clean install Windows 10 on the SSD. 
<br />
<br />This will give you the best possible performance form the SSD with a Clean System
<br />
<br />You will need to backup your Data and later restore that and re-install your Software . .. 
<br />
<br />Also Please Note, when installing Windows 10 make sure the SSD is the only drive attached to your PC
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />

            <p>3GB is the amount of RAM you have; it has nothing to do with its speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speed the RAM runs at is set by the motherboard. When you buy RAM, each stick comes with a particular speed, but that is actually *not* its speed; it's the speed it's certified to run at&nbsp; without a problem. If you install RAM with a speed lower than
 what the motherboard will run it at, you're looking for trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way, it has nothing to do with your question, but running with unmatched sticks of RAM as you are doing, often creates a problem.</p>

<h2>            Need Bluetooth Driver for Sony Vaio running Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello <strong>Microsoft</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My <strong>Sony Vaio</strong> Laptop is using <strong>Windows 7 64 bit</strong>.
</p>
<p>In the <strong>Device Manager </strong>I found&nbsp;one item with an "<strong>Exclaimation Mark</strong>" right next to "<strong>Bluetooth Peripherial Device</strong>" under Other Devices.</p>
<p>From the properties I found out that one item is within a problem and is located on "<strong>Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</strong>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to perform <strong>Windows Update </strong>to get the driver but it says no update available, and I can't find the driver online because I don't know what
<strong>version </strong>I'm looking for or anything, could anyone help? </p>
<p>Thanks in further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Edit 5/19/2016: Blue Screen of Death has claimed the life of my computer. Hargrove was barely working and we were able to get a refund thanks to warranty and went with Apple in hopes we don't have to experience blue screens of death again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so annoyed.. I was playing a game last night and suddenly I get a blue screen and than a loop of restarting in an attempt to repair the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is CyperpowerPC model GUA2200BST AMD FX-8320 is&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Repair.. That was a big fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore : three separate points and the only three available to me. It didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode : yeah no.. It won't even consider starting in safe mode.Windows 10 hates me ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening up that command thing where you press delete in the booting process and changes the BCwhatever to its defaults like suggested in a different post. Pretty sure my computer chuckled at me because it most definitely gave me a bye Felicia response (obviously
 it didn't work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally would be the start menu suggestions however and to my obvious dismay it won't move past this blue screen of death! (I'm having Xbox 360 nostalgia)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so besides completely reseting my computer so that I lose my life and the hours spent downloading FFXIV what could I do that I haven't done yet to fix this **** because I'm not to happy.. Right now I'm having buyers remorse wishing I went to Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Because im impatient awaiting a responses tried this next step as well.. However I didn't work either ï¿½ï¿½.</p>
<p>
</p><p>opened up the command prompt and did the command bootrec.exe along with the 5 or 6 other&nbsp;commands that were suggested in a different post.&nbsp;</p>

            I have already done this. After contacting different support people who give me the whole "you have cancer so now you will die" speech I'm taking it in to get looked at. I am livid though and I would hope this falls under my manufacture warranty and not
 the protection plan that I purchased since the computer is less then three months old.. I really hope that any more updates Microsoft decides to have will not ruin anymore computers as this blue screen of death seems to be a huge issue among a lot of people.
 Ever since 7 Windows has been on a down hill spiral to death land. It's be epic if. The many computer guros at Microsoft could get a handle on this issue quickly. I love the saying "if it's not broke don't fix it" I really think Microsoft needs to back track
 and figure out where they went wrong and issue an apology to the customers that get screwed because of their constant mistakes.&nbsp;

            When I find out the issue and how the techs are able to fix it I will update you. At this point since nothing I have researched and tried has worked ( I've been working on this computer for about 8+hrs) I'm assuming the worst. We only use this computer
 for one game and to load pictures onto the computer from our camera.. So considering the amount of use it doesn't get I'm just shocked something like this is even happening. Disappointment isn't even a good word for the feels I have.&nbsp;

            <p>After spending three hours with geeks quad I has come to the realization that the hard drive was done. Thankfully I was covered under two warranties and was able to get a replacement computer. I will be going with a Mac to avoid another blue screen of death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that both myself and the geek squad did everything that was suggested on this site and in the forums and nothing worked. I'm not illiterate when it comes to computers and with proper guidance I can do just about anything... For me to have
 done it all and for geek squad to become just as annoyed as me really made me question the companies I shiver my money to. We will be an apple household from here on out. Windows is always steering us in the path of disasters .</p>

    <title>Copying a large Zip folder takes ages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptoye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying a large Zip folder takes ages</h2>
                    <p>Having downloaded a large (285MB) Zip file from the MS site to my normal download folder, I wanted to move it to another folder, so did a drag.. The estimated time was 9 hours! After about 20 minutes I gave up and downloaded it again directly to the destination
 folder - <strong>far </strong>shorter - about 7 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is going on? I have a nasty feeling that Windows Explorer is treating the Zip file as a folder, extracting each file within it and re-zipping it. Can MS really be so stupid? Or am I mistaken?</p>
                </div>

<p>When you use Windows Explorer to move a file from one folder to another on the same drive then the move is instantaneous. Microsoft Security Essentials does not open the zip file. You can easily test this by including a test virus in a zip file. MSE will
 pick up the test virus at unzip time but will ignore it while moving the zip file.</p>

<p>You need to deactivate Real-Time Protection while creating Eicar.com and putting it into the .zip file.</p>

            <p>Tried that - got the Zip file OK. Then reactivated MSE. Zip file disappeared, together with the original test fle! At least MSE is doing its job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was putting the file on the desktop - maybe MSE checks that in more detail than other folders. No time to check it today (it's evening here and food is coming onto the table) though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Later] I've now tried putting the Eicar text into a zip file in one of my own folders rather than the desktop. When I reactivated MSE it found the .txt file but not the Zip, and I can drag and drop the zip file without MSE finding it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I really don't know why dragging the mega-zip file from the download folder to another one took so long. And I've just tried it again and it moves instantaneously. I think one has to put it down as one of those Windows things. Sometimes it works, sometimes
 it doesn't. Possibly finger trouble. If I tell it to copy rather than move it certainly opens each file in the zip and copies it separately (and possibly virus-checks as well), which still seems perverse.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashing and or Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 crashing and or Freezing -&nbsp; Long story short.<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 10 32 bit DVD Disk AND a USB Windows 10 32 bit&nbsp;and 64 bit installation media/s.<br />
<br />
And my woes all began when I used the&nbsp;DVD disk to upgrade&nbsp;what was a hassle free Windows 7.<br />
</p>
<p>All was going well until it got to installing and setting up drivers, where the install rebooted &amp; just looped and looped, to which I was advised&nbsp;the install or upgrade failed.<br />
<br />
Few days later after reading&nbsp;Umpteen windows 10 help files - I connected up offending computer to an Ethernet Cable and after&nbsp;several attempts&nbsp;Windows 10 was finally up and running, so I switched off the system and disconnected the&nbsp;Ethernet cable and plugged
 in the USB TP-Link WiFi and placed the computer back to where it is used.<br />
<br />
Next Day I ended up receiving&nbsp;a complete out of character&nbsp;borderline physical-verbal abuse, because as soon as the computer got to the login screen it would freeze as my wife attempted to log in and then in some cases reboot and repeat before she could do anything,
 thankfully she could use my computer,&nbsp;as I removed the WiFi and plug the Ethernet cable back into her system.<br />
<br />
I tried both a 32 bit and a 64 bit installations - mind you it would only install after XP was first upgraded to windows 7&nbsp;so that windows 10 could&nbsp;be upgraded - disappointingly &nbsp;- A Clean Install just wont install no matter what I try..<br />
<br />
So yeah has anybody got a clue why Windows 10 is so problematic just for that system out of the other 5 systems, and what can I do to fix it so the computer doesn't freeze as soon as the Ethernet cable is disconnected?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>OK&nbsp;Pounding the F8 Key like a male at&nbsp;his first time, simply Froze the system - No doubt the Bios was fooled into&nbsp;a keyboard error.<br />
<br />
So after holding down the Power switch and rebooting into windows 10 and then restarting the system several times,&nbsp;mashing the F8 key at different rates&nbsp;- I gave up as it seems it just refuses to boot into safe mode, So now what?<br />
<br />
And before&nbsp;anyone responds I already tried&nbsp;many of the common command prompts "provided in the online help files and or forums" as an admin, and nothing is unusual and the exercises does nothing.<br />
<br />
Two previous windows 10 successful installs ago - I tried Motherboard drivers but I kept messing it up as&nbsp;after&nbsp;doing that&nbsp;- the system&nbsp;always goes&nbsp;into a constant loop going no further than the login screen.<br />
<br />
Now these Error message/s&nbsp;seem to be always coming up when installing "what is going to be a failed" Window 10 Attempt, which without a doubt and sure as rain is due to the Ethernet Cable&nbsp;being unplugged, whilst a USB WiFI identified as a&nbsp;TP-Link TL-WN821N
 "Version 3" is plugged into a USB Port.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am hoping this might provide some&nbsp;freak-N programming Genius a complete Fix,&nbsp;Err-Here's the error data..<br />
<br />
0xC1900101-0x30018<br />
The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error<br />
SYS Prep operation</p>
<p>80240020</p>
<p>BTW Windows 3.1,&nbsp;Win95, Windows 95 plus, WIn98, Wi Me, XP, Vista, &amp; Win-7 all&nbsp;work perfectly on this system, Hey I had to find out if it was the hardware.
<br />
<br />
Anyway -&nbsp;I forwent windows 8&nbsp;onward as I never got&nbsp;the beta's&nbsp;to work on any of my computers including the problematic system&nbsp;-&nbsp; which BTW is not the oldest system as all my hard ware&nbsp;is Gigabyte.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem system is an AMD Athlon 64 x2 Dual 4600+ 2.41 Ghz&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on a GA-M55-SLI-S4, mother board,&nbsp;I still have an old Nvidia&nbsp; Geforce 8400GS video card on that system.</p>

<h2>            Cant access power management plans on windows 7 ultimate</h2>
                    I can not access Power management settings for windows 7. Once I get to the power management (
<strong>Control Panel&gt; Power Options&gt; Edit Plan Settings</strong> ) area on the control panel i get the fllowing error message "Your power plan information isnÂ´t available"
<br />
<br />
So I can not modify my power management options to prevent my laptop from hibernating while unattended during long internet downloads..<br />
<br />
Does any one know if there is a walk around for this issue.

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to turn on power management plans on your computer, you need to try changing the registry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>
 This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the
 registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/ ) </span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to start, in search box type in Regedit.</span></p>
<p><span>Search for the below mentioned path:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\</span><span>system\currentcontrolset\control\power\powersettings</span></p>
<p><span>Under this you should be able to see 15 subkeys.
</span></p>
<p><span>Incase if you are missing on any of the subkeys, please copy the same from a different computer and paste.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case if this doesnâ€™t fix your issue, suggest you to perform a system restore. To perform the system restore,
 please visit the below mentioned link:</span></p>

    <title>Cannot activate reinstalled Windows with OEM key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azazel9088  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate reinstalled Windows with OEM key</h2>
                    <p>I've reinstalled my Windows 10 Home edition because it was Chinese and I wanted English. Turned out my key was a single-language Chinese key so I've downloaded the Chinese installer to reinstall the original system and activate it so that I can at least
 have a working operating system. But when I tried to active the system it didn't accept the key. By the way it's an OEM key, I don't know if it helps. Any ideas?</p>

Thank you but it doesn't activate itself after installation. Asked MS support and they said it can be activated only in China. Since I can't go to China (I'm in Europe) I tried using VPN but it didn't help either. I didn't even know such license keys existed...
 I mean come on. Having to go to China to activate my system? What was MS thinking?

<p>It's up to you to find the one that will work with your licence unfortunately. If you go back to version 1703 I notice they list Windows 10 Single Language, if the download is available then try that. They don't make it easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure there is not a recovery partition from the OEM on the device. You would need to check their documentation to see how to initial the recovery. Often it involves pressing a key during the boot process.</p>

            <p>This new 'update fix' is wreaking havoc across the board.</p>
<p>First, try to remove the Hotmail accounts and add&nbsp;them again:</p>
<p>Open Windows Live mail.</p>
<p>Click 'File' at top left. Click on 'Options'&gt; 'Email Accounts.' Click on 'Properties' and copy down all the info on each tab. (For Hotmail, none of the settings needed to be re-entered in my case, but&nbsp;just in case...)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highlight account&nbsp;and click 'Remove'.</p>
<p>Then, as above, click on 'Add' email account and enter the info as required.</p>
<p>If you still are not able send/receive on&nbsp;Microsoft accounts, you may need to </p>
<p>uninstall Windows Live Essentials (mail component)&nbsp;to remove the 'fix'. (KB3093594 doesn't show up in programs /updates.)</p>
<p>Reinstall Windows Live Essentials (mail) - Live mail should now work but you may need to remove the Hotmail accounts and add&nbsp;them again, as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing the 'update fix' isn't necessary yet until Microsoft actually makes the changes they are planning to their email&nbsp; services.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Addendum: Some users, including myself,&nbsp;may not have read the fine print when they downloaded the fix- it is for Windows 7/8&nbsp;only, not 10! As well, I'm not sure if the Windows Live Essentials&nbsp;currently available&nbsp;for download already contains this 'fix' so
 one might need to locate an older&nbsp;version if they are still having the &nbsp;same problems after re-installing.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback DG1960 - I am running Win 7 on the system with the problem - I haven't tried it on one of my Win 10 systems - yet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that somewhere this "fix" has told Windows Live Mail to use the following url "<strong><em>https://m.hotmail.com/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync".</em></strong> I cannot locate where it has set this value.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look in the email account properties information for the server url I still have the same values set as previously (I checked these with some of my other systems) The old value (and the one that still works on systems without the fix) is"https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/sync.aspx".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition if I enter https://m.hotmail.com in a browser it comes back with the response that the DNS lookup failed!! This would seem to imply this address does not exist - surely Microsoft would not have implemented a 'fix' back in early November which
 invokes a web site that does not exist, and surely by now they would have addressed the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I am a bit concerned about the address in the email which says the fix is needed - this is&nbsp;http://communication.microsoft.com/Key-6859401.C.rv22.N.K4.-.nFwJQdB - I'm not convinced this is a valid Microsoft address even though it appears to send one
 to a valid Microsoft address - it just does not feel right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you (or some other helpful soul) has any better info I think I'm inclined to go back to a backup from earlier last week as the safest and ultimately quickest route to resolution? Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Installing the KB alone <strong>WOULD NOT</strong>&nbsp;work if mail server settings are still of the old SYNC way. I got the similar error initially after applying the KB. I
<strong>fixed it by following this setup</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/wiki/livemail-email/windows-live-mail-and-outlook-mail/6edb5ba6-f9f2-40fd-80a1-fc23cc6fbfe0"><strong>GUIDE</strong></a>. Try it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion for MSFT: When you notify user to install that KB, make sure you tell them to refresh their server setup w/ the latest IMAP/SMTP settings as well. Many are still using the old SYNC mechanism unaware of their settings are outdated and no longer
 work w/ this KB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me MSFT was more interested in getting you to upgrade to Win10 than making sure your WLM 12 still works on Win7.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info, are we really sure this is a genuine Microsoft KB fix - as I said in my feedback to DG1960 there are lots of things about the email that just do not look right, and don't add up. I mean why should the DNS lookup fail for m.hotmail.com
 if it is a genuine Microsoft site? Also I cannot find that much info on the web about this issue, which I would expect if it were a genuine Microsoft foul-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided not to go down the "fix it" routes, with all due respect to you guys, so I restored a backup from a few days ago and am now back using Windows Live Mail 2012 without the "fix". It sounded as if I would end up with a bit of a botched system if I
 went for IMAP. I'm going to stay away from the "fix" until I hear more from Microsoft - I reported the email to them as SPAM and something that broke my system, not that I'm expecting them to reply to those sort of emails - unfortunately they never do, but
 maybe, just maybe it will get to someone who will ensure better info is produced in future if this is genuine.</p>

            Hi DG1960, A man after my own way of thinking. Just as a matter of interest which of your suggested routes did you use successfully to reverse the change? Was an uninstall/reinstall of the code enough or did you need to remove/add the accounts as well?

    <title>Windows 10 user passwords with Microsoft Account messes with windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meretet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 user passwords with Microsoft Account messes with windows 7 previous accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi, This is mainly please explain as I have now fully formatted my system and re-installed my windows 7 x64. And the 50 or so programs I had purchased quite a painful journey time wise. Stressful experience. I had of course backed up everything.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded all three systems here &nbsp;to windows 10 ,</p>
<p>1 was through the windows updates the other 2, &nbsp;I downloaded the Windows 10 manually.</p>
<p>I noticed there is a different experience for desktop users and what video cards installed verses x32 bit by x64 .
</p>
<p>This windows 10 OS is designed for mobile devices iPad laptops not desktops. The security is too high and the control has been taken away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem started &nbsp;4 days later that when I rebooted it asked for my password to log into my windows even though I had disabled login password.</p>
<p>I had never set a windows password??</p>
<p>So what password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the other systems also had the same problem and I resolved that by several reboots.</p>
<p>The problem escalated where I had to put in a password everywhere and then it was not accepted.</p>
<p>I had made the media creation tool USB for this system so used that to figure out why I had been locked out of my system and nothing would work as it wouldn't accept my Microsoft password which is my ISP password as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I couldn't do a system restore or access safemode. I tried the cmd prompt and tried to create a new user through cmd nope I had to put in password at every step and that password was not accepted even though that was the correct password.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>Anyone can check the password?</p>
<p>I am the default administrator and there was noway I could find this hidden administrator.
</p>
<p>The new profile I created in CMD prompt didn't appear on the screen at boot. </p>
<p>The shutdown button had disappeared on the boot screen as well so had to reset manually.</p>
<p>I was stuck with noway out because of some problem with a password. </p>
<p>What password could it have been? </p>
<p>I am now too scarred to upgrade to windows 10 even though I did find it a good upgrade,</p>
<p>however this is really serious where we have to use a password to do a system restore or access safemode?</p>
<p>I could not even roll back to fix things.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any ideas and an explanation how a password was required to log into windows when I had disabled that.
</p>
<p>Why nothing would run even in the media creation tool menu without a password.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>
<p>Merete</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the error message when you try to type a password that you know?</p>
<p>2. Do you see your email address on the log in screen? Or just your name?</p>
<p>3. Is the message on you log in screen "Hi there. Welcome back!" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answers will be very helpful for us to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: In some cases I have encountered, if in Windows 7 you disabled / bypass the log in password, that old password might be required after you upgrade the Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi the first error was wrong password, I looked at it and it was right so typed it in again, in the bottom left corner was two accounts one with my email and one without both the same?</p>
<p>Then I started to get my account was disabled that's when I decided to try the media creation tool to recover or restore my system and that's when I encountered a password was required. I did take a couple of photos this was when I saw the account disabled
 and I thought I had tried the password too many times?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Then in the recovery console dont know what it's called when I used the media creation tool USB it asked me to choose an account?There was only mine and when I select it it asked for a password whcih it didnt accept. It is eh same password I use here to
 log into Microsoft?</p>
<p>Thank you..</p>

            <p>I couldn't get past my login screen once it started,</p>
<p>prior my emails access was fine I used windows live and was logged into Microsoft using the same password that suddenly went south.</p>
<p>I did try that as well, I logged into Outlook online and went to change my password and after a few next next oops Microsoft message I couldn't do that here I had contact my ISP. So I went to &nbsp;my online ISP&gt;Telstra and changed my password, the thing is I
 couldn't get past my login at windows 10 so no matter what password was used in my emails I couldn't access it.</p>
<p>Strange hey. I gave it everything I tried everything possible I even took the drive out of my system and plugged it into another and tried to repair the profile. and replaced the NTuser dot dat and ini files etc with the backup I made at the start of windows
 upgrade.</p>
<p>I have never encountered such a problem that I couldn't fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also tried the registry tricks from here even though it was a different problem.</p>
<p>http://www.techbout.com/user-profile-cannot-be-loaded-error-in-windows-10-9115/&nbsp;</p>
<p>My theory is that my password somehow nolonger pointed to my profile as it was corrupted .</p>
<p>&nbsp;I use "User" as my registered name with windows installs &nbsp;and I also noticed that&nbsp;Microsoft decided to make my profile name Merete T. That could have played a part.</p>
<p>When you look at the top of the start menu is the name of your profile. It applies to everything Public folders shared folders anything. Mine always said User .</p>
<p>Where Merete T came from with a gap too &nbsp;I dont know as my email is meretet@isp they couldn't separate Merete with the T as the T was supposed to be the letter for my surname. So where did Merete T come from?</p>
<p>I just looked and my Microsoft account at the top of my windows live has Merete T on it. This is the only place I would have seen that and it is access to Outlook on OneDrive. Yet it uses the same password.</p>
<p>My question is why I had to log into windows 10? </p>
<p>Possible the bug &nbsp;is this a Microsoft windows 10 heavy emphasis with always being logged in Microsoft account, and when the log in was requested &nbsp;to my windows didn't match my profile name User with &nbsp;Microsoft Merete T? &nbsp;</p>
<p>also windows live is being phased out in July what will I do if it is killed with my windows 7? Use Outlook on Onedrive?</p>
<p>I want safemode back and the normal access to fix the system, not every desktop installing windows has the newer&nbsp;UEFI<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;(</span>Unified

            <p>I reinstalled windows 10 after I had reinstalled windows 7 and created an image.</p>
<p>Started with the same problem, comparing settings I am logging in using a Microsoft account instead of a local account, that is the first key.</p>
<p>and I think I found the solution to the cause, I have two computers with similar names for the network the difference was the computer name. So when I installed windows 10 this time I used my own maiden name instead of User. Then named my computer with that
 I am now on my local network in the 3 systems that solved problem 1.</p>
<p>I think what happened when I disabled one of the user accounts to fix my default which is also administrator, all my accounts I created were default admins but disabling the one I thought was a spare actually disabled all of them, that is a bug.</p>
<p>When I looked in the Netplwiz now it says Merete@ - debugger Users Admins.</p>
<p>So the difference now is I use MS to log in am not confident to try change this atm to login locally incase it decides not accept my MS password again.</p>
<p>But this kind of explains it a little, I still cant understand why my password was rejected as that's what started the previous problem. Note even though teh 2 systems use a different name they both used the same Microsoft Windows Live Account which uses
 my ISP. I'd say that is where the connected got messed up?</p>
<p>Your thoughts</p>

            Never resolved it, the registered name Merete is not the same as Microsoft Merete T which is my ISP name cannot change it. No solution as I cannot even log in with Local Account. So I have to just leave it as is cannot share files on my network because
