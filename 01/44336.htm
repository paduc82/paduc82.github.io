<h2>            wrong Skype account</h2>
                    <p>I have two Skype accounts. &nbsp;The 60 monthly free minutes from my Office subscription were automatically linked to the wrong Skype account. &nbsp;When I go to the correct Skype account and click on the link to "My Microsoft Account", it tells me I'm already logged
 into my Microsoft account. &nbsp;So I assumed that this was the account that the minutes would be linked to. &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">JeffStern2</span>,</p>

</p><p>This is the FAQ link that you need to check about your concern: </p>

</a></strong>
<p>
</p><p>But to give you a heads-up, it is not possible for your to link your Skype minutes to your Skype account since it can only be linked to the Microsoft account you used to purchased the office 365 subscription and your Skype account is already a Microsoft
 account.</p>

<h2>            Battlefield 4 Installation stuck at 40&#37;. Installation Stopped. ps - I have power cycled 5 times and have done online and offline installation. </h2>
                    
<p>I am really having some difficulties with my Battlefield 4 Installation. Every time it gets to 40% it stops. I have followed all the recommendations on YouTube and what the Xbox Support home page has to offer. I have power cycled the console more times than
 I can count. I have carried out each installation with updates and without. Online and offline.</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;after a nice fix. I installed Star Wars Battlefront the other day completely fine. I also have 100GB left in my hard drive.</p>
<p>I really am at a loss here and the disc is in pristine condition. I can work other games&nbsp;completely fine as well.&nbsp;I have cancelled and re-installed multiple times.</p>
<p>Any advise would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Logitech G633 showing up as headphones, therefore not recognized by LGS</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now spent the last 3 hours trying to figure out how to make the computer STOP recognizing my Logitech G633 from showing up as speakers.<br />
No matter what I do, this is probably a 3rd of what I have actually tried:<br />
</p>
<p>- Uninstall drivers</p>
<p>-Revert drivers</p>
<p>- Uninstall and reinstall LGS</p>
<p>- Uninstalling drivers, LGS, disconneting headphones, rebooting, installing both again.</p>
<p>- Plugging them in and out, a few times to see if the system will figure something out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SAME story, they keep showing up as Speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have really tried almost everything I can find around the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was NEVER a problem with my old system. Everything connected as it was supposed to.</p>
<p>I have spent 30 000 SEK on a computer that is just not working properly. </p>
<p>The computer is, but WIN10 is driving me absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone PLEASE try and help me figure out where me and WIN10 just aren't buddies enough yet.</p>
<p>I have no clue as of what to do. It is sad, to finally upgrade to WIN10 and just find so many problems I just can't figure out.</p>
<p>I am very technical and shouldn't be having these issues with such a "modern" operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if you need it but the important specifications:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Prime Z370-A</p>
<p>i7 - 8700K</p>
<p>GTX 1070</p>

            Try these:
<br />Device manager &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden Devices &gt; Sound, Video, and Game controllers &gt; Uninstall Logitech g633 Headset driver (the label was grayed out, and said the device wasn't plugged in, which it was) &gt; Restart computer
<br /> 
<br />2. Leave your headset plugged into the computer as it restarts!! (might work now, but if not keep reading)
<br /> 
<br />3. Go to Device Manager once computer restarts &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden Devices &gt; Universal Serial Bus Controllers &gt; find as many labels that state: "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)" and uninstall ALL of them. 
<br /> 
<br />4. Restart computer (again), keep headset plugged in still, and it should work next boot.
<br /> 
<br />5. If it still doesn't work, your last resorts are:
<br />System restore
<br />Use USB Oblivion (google it)
<br />Restore PC to factory settings
<br /> 
<br />**Note: My headset was detected by my desktop after I uninstalled the Unknown USB Devices. Those didn't even show up until I removed the original G633 driver though.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, have tried most of these. Still no luck.</p>
<p>But found a new problem, after trying to look for errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says in Swedish: USB-unit is not compatible/does not work with USB 3.0.</p>
<p>I see that as pretty problematic...</p>

            That is strange, I can only think the headset is USB 3 only but you have USB 2 on the PC.
<br />If it was the other way around then it should work as USB 3 is backwards compatible.

            I wonder if they need to be connected to both USB &amp; 3.5 audio jack.
<br />Have you downloaded the Logitech gaming software?

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried absolutely everything humanly possible. Followed every step, for lots of different solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried uninstalling all drivers for USB-ports as well to see if it would recognize that something was wrong, considering the USB-ports for some reason aren't backwards compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried checking if USB legacy is activated. It is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalled and installed LGS multiple times and deleting everything from the registry multiple times, didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried connecting to different USB-ports, all of them.</p>
<p>Found another solution that might work. Getting a USB-hub that only supports USB 2.0.&nbsp;<br />
Just have to find the time to go and buy it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD from DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 and I'm pretty sure I have every driver up to date, BIOS is up to date.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am experiencing the BSOD when my laptop sit idle for a little while and the screen turns off. The laptop will just restart cause of the BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the minidump:&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kLLn4oYmrp-dK5edlf0Q0tCCvxEZvE9A/view?usp=sharing</p>

</p><p>On another issue does anyone know how to stop the touchpad from re-enabling upon restart?</p>

            Hi Crowlord3,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Analysis Results
<br />
<br />File Name: 020219-10984-01.dmp
<br />DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)
<br />IMAGE_NAME:  dxgkrnl.sys
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />
<br />B. Third Party Drivers
<br />nvlddmkm.sys - nVidia
<br />Driver Date - 11-Jan-2019
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Your nVidia driver is very new. The driver date is 11-Jan-2019. If BSOD started happening after 11-Jan-2019, you have two options
<br />Roll back nVidia driver
<br />Go to computer manufacturer's website and see if any driver is released after 11-Jan-2019.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the problem has been happening for a long time, much much longer then just this year. I can't remember but it date back to 2017 even and through multiple windows installations. I was hoping that the minidump would provide some intel to help me fix it.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I have done them and will be awaiting to see if the blue screens continue.</p>

                    <p>hola, hace tiempo había comprado un disco duro de 320Gb y iba todo bien hasta una semana después que empezó a fallar sin razón alguna, es raro porque después en almacenamiento decía que era un dispositivo sin formatear, lo he intentado innumerables veces
 con el número de serie pero siempre en la mitad del formateo decía&nbsp;<strong>Acción no&nbsp;realizable, la acción no se pudo realizar</strong> entonces el disco duro no lo puedo utilizar. Mi pregunta es ¿hay alguna forma de que el disco funcione sin errores? o si
 hay alguna especie de solución por favor. Este problema lo tengo hace tiempo y no sé como solucionarlo.</p>
<p>

<h2>            im getting accused of cheating on black ops 2 a lot more these days</h2>
                    
<p>ok so this is the problem im having.</p>
<p>so when u play black ops 2 everyday u become a lot better,&nbsp; u can react better,&nbsp; u can see people better and u get to know where people will be on each map and where to get the most kills.</p>
<p>but on this black ops i have got to the point where i can get 20 plus kills nearly every game easy. but now i get people accusing me of cheating.</p>
<p>one person said i had hacked the game and was using an aimbot . ( i am not pc savvy and only new what&nbsp; a cookie was and how to clear them last year lol.) so this is well beyond my capabillities.</p>
<p>but&nbsp; also because im using the fal with select fire attachment so i can use automatic fire, im now getting people saying im using a modded pad lol. i cant win.</p>
<p>one guy sent me a message saying nothing but "reported" which annoyed me.</p>
<p>and now im 10 prestige with diamond camo **** rifles its happening more. took me ages and a lot of effort to get diamond camo and dont want to get banned because people are just not as good as me.</p>
<p>my questions is can u guys see from your end if someone is cheating?&nbsp; and have people being banned just for getting wrongly reported?</p>
<p>this would put my mind at ease.</p>

<p>and has anyone else had this problem? like to hear your storys.</p>

<p>I get 20+ kills every game and I use the fal select fire a lot but ive never had people say im cheating, most ppl who play cod surely know about select fire by now. I don't think you can be banned that easily because if that was the case you could in theory
 get your friends list to report someone and get them banned, pretty sure they would have to see evidence, and if your playing legit there will be no evidence of cheating so I wouldn't worry.</p>

<p>Somebody in here will pull your stats soon enough, but anyways, if you are NOT cheating, then dont worry about it? Especially enough to make a thread about it. I have friends that get "fan mail" every game, but they are getting like 50-60 kills every game

<p>ok guys 20 kills is ment as my &nbsp;average score. &nbsp;i only play team deathmatch &nbsp;and i use more than just the fal but that was my main gun.</p>
<p>but i can get over 30 kills a lot and ive had over 40 a few times. i have saved replays of me getting 43-10 and 45-10 plus i have had a 30 kill streak on there too.</p>
<p>what im saying is ive being accused of every form of cheating that i know off. but im glad to hear that u cant get banned for nothing. &nbsp;my next challenge now is diamond pistols. so i will post here when the next person says im cheating. and at this rate
 i give it 2 week lol</p>

</p><p>I am trying to connect my Xbox One to my schools Network, so I can update the console&nbsp;however it comes up with the error that the Xbox cannot connect to WPA Enterprise security.&nbsp; Is there any way I could either get it to connect or manually install the updates.

<h2>            Xbox One Club Chat not updating</h2>
                    <p>Having an issue where, after I created my club yesterday, the chat has not allowed me to post messages or MoTD. Every time I send out a message it does not stay or even update once I leave the club and return. I've tried both on my phone and on my console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else run into this problem?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm sorry to hear this effect you, I have had this happen on pc to th the xbox app and mobile. As im not sure why this would be happening. You can try to power cycle you console and see if that helps there and uninstall and reinstall the app on mobile.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Edit Taskbar Toolbar Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pete999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edit Taskbar Toolbar Menu</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 Pro, if you right click on the Taskbar and select Toolbars, you get another menu with a list of toolbars that you can add.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have an entry in that list that's left over from a program that I mistakenly installed (Pokki).&nbsp; The program is uninstalled and selecting the toolbar doesn't do anything, but I'd like to remove it from the list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How/where do I edit the list of toolbars?</p>

            Right click on a blank area of the Taskbar, select Properties and click the Toolbars tab. Is Pokki listed there. If yes uncheck the box before Pokki and click Apply. You may need to unlock the Taskbar first to remove.

            <p>No, that doesn't work.&nbsp; Pokki is listed there (along with all of the other 5 entries in the pop-up menu).&nbsp; None of them are checked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't think you've quite understood the question.&nbsp; I don't want to remove a toolbar from the Taskbar (which is what unchecking a box on the Toolbars tab on the Properties screen does).&nbsp; I want to remove
<strong>the listing</strong> of the toolbar from the right click menu.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Presumably, removing something from the right click menu&nbsp;would also remove the same thing from&nbsp;the Toolbars tab on the Properties menu.</p>

<h2>            How to reduce xbox one latency&#63; &#40;ethernet cable&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Further on from my post yesterday, i've found out that it is the latency that is causing my problem with games disconnecting. I have opened the required ports on my router and opened my dmz and it has helped, but i'm still getting very bad lag that is almost
 causing me to be kicked from the servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Is there a way to solve this latency and get it down (it's current 150-170ms)? Is it a simple as using a ethernet cable from my router to the xbox, and will that lower it dramatically? My current router is a virgin superhub 2.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connecting directly to your router using an Ethernet cable should significantly reduce lag/latency. Or you could upgrade your wireless router to wireless n or higher for better speeds/range.</p>

<p>unless you have some serious radio interference*, going from wireless to wired won't make that much of a difference, if you are seeing the same latency wired to the router, then you'll contact your ISP to have them check the connection.</p>
<p>*=if it is interference, then you can check with a wifi scanner app for smartphones, a lot of router like to default to channels 5 or 6 (if you're running G mode), speaking of, are you using 2.4ghz or 5ghz?</p>

<p>A wired connection is always better than a wireless connection because it's a direct link and there in no interference. I have Comcast Blast and was 50/10mbps. Now Comcast just upgraded their Blast customers 100mbps. I wasn't getting that though. I was determined
 to find out why. Then it hit me. I had Comcast's all in one modem/router and was connected to my personal router. When I disconnected my personal router and decided to use just the all in one Comcast modem/router the results were phenomenal. I did detailed
 network statistics and my download/upload speed was 120/12.50mbps. So if you have Comcast, I would definitely disconnect your personal router and just use theirs and also check if your eligible for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Trust me i went through connection BS for months...i had an open network and everything would seem fine...but after an hour or soo my x1 would lose connection and the latency would be through the roof...now that i used a eithernet cable instead of going
 wireless everything has been much much smoother. My latencly is usually at 97-98 which is fine for me....i got 50 mbps broadband internet but for some reason my xbox only gets about 11 mbps which gets me through a game lag free but if it drops to around 7
 which it use to do before the Ethernet i would get some bad lag. Im upgrading to the lighting fast internet which gets me 90 mbps hoping to pump out more than 11 mbps out of my xbox...hopefully that works.</p>

 worked on and I need to retrieve those. &nbsp;These are NOT files that are in my regular profile, I can access those without any problem; these are specifically the files used during the temporary profile. &nbsp;

 but was afraid this might be the case. &nbsp;She had 400 images open today and I saved those onto an external hard drive before she lost her edits there as well.

            hello Hilmar
<br />check under audio setting see if someone mutted your windows sound. also check under sound devices the audio chipset and not gpu chipset set as main audio output. if the output still low try installing the newest audio driver see if the audio driver got damaged. also check to see if window or your media player audio set right.
<br />
<br />
<br />to reload the audio driver and check.
<br />
<br />a. Click on Start button. Type Device Manager and press Enter.
<br />
<br />b. Under Device Manager windows, expand Sound, video, and game controllers and locate the sound card.
<br />c. Click Uninstall.
<br />d.Restart the computer and check.

<br />
This is not a sarcastic answer: Ask Norton.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
After all - read your own question: "What file does this Norton program change to make it boot to Disk Doctor instead of the normal windows boot cycle?" and then ask yourself who you should ask that question of in order to get the answer... Microsoft or Norton?

<p><br />
"Win 8 boot cycle files" &lt;- whatever you think that is... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restore from the backups one should always make - but especially before they do something they know is risky.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Your problem is not with a Microsoft product - but with a Norton product.&nbsp; What changes they make using their utilities - only they know.&nbsp; Doesn't matter what defaults are supposed to be there - if the automated tools cannot fix the issue Norton created for
 you - then you are probably resolved to restoration/clean install.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Yes - Norton has terrible technical support.&nbsp; A ten second Google search before you destroyed the computer using their utility would have prevented this issue.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
This is a peer-to-peer forum.&nbsp; Many here would not recommend most Norton products.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
At least you have posted on the proper forums:<br />

    <title>Creators update broke my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeviterbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creators update broke my PC</h2>
                    <p>I have been running the anniversary version of Windows 10 pro and yesterday my computer prompted me to upgrade, I'm assuming it's the creators update. &nbsp;After letting Windows do it's thing, it asked if I should shut down or restart the computer to finish
 installing updates. &nbsp;I chose shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turned on my computer this morning it did not show the Windows logo on start up. &nbsp;Instead it restarted before that and continues to restart over and over and over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a bootable Windows 10 creators update media DVD, booted from that and was prompted with "It looks like you started an update..." window. &nbsp;If I click Yes, it just reboots over and over. &nbsp;So I pressed ESC and went to the Troubleshoot menu. &nbsp;I tried
 Startup repair and it attempted repairs. &nbsp;Then it said that this PC cannot be repaired. &nbsp;So then I tried Go Back to Previous version. &nbsp;It said that I cannot and need to Reset my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Creators update broke my PC. &nbsp;What now!?</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If performing a <strong>Startup repair</strong> and <strong>System Restore</strong> didn't work, the next step that you can do is to
<strong>Go Back to Previous version</strong>. However, as what you've stated on your post, the system can't go back to the previous version and it says you need to reset your PC. Note that there are options in resetting your PC. You can either keep your files
 or remove everything. If you opt to reset your PC, you can follow the steps on how to reset your PC from this article:

            we've had the same thing happen on 3 PCs, the reset is about as much help as the other options you tried. we did have one HP laptop that had an HP reset option in the fix menu, surprisingly, that worked perfectly. well if consider resetting to factory
 "perfectly". i would think MS needs a better response than "just run through the reset process, hope you keep your files...".

</p><p>Similar problem 11/21/2017. Was prompted to install <span><strong>Fall Creators Update
</strong>last night. After doing so, I could shutdown the computer Start&gt;Power&gt;Shutdown, but once off, it immediately restarted. Over and Over. It was like shutdown had morphed into restart. I uninstalled the release, problem went away.</span></p>

</p><p>The release broke my Dell XPS 27 desktop; I had to roll the release back and luckily that worked. That is&nbsp; POOR solution to a bug that should have been caught. 30+ years in software development .. not a newbie. This was a beta release level bug; Microsoft
 either needs to up their game on QC, provide a proper fix for this, and/or allow users the options to DEFER major updates til they are rock solid. There are early adopters (willing to tolerate unreliability for cool new features) and late adopters (it needs
 to be ROCK SOLID when it gets these folks). I'm a late adopter and a not ready for prime time release was pushed out. IMO -- Rich Denney, author of Succeeding with Use Cases &amp; Use Case Levels of Test.</p>

<p>Even when 1709 first started downloading (!?) my laptop lagged out as hell and since then, even through 2 clean installations from USB, updating drives and whatnot, it's still the same piece of garbage that won't even play a movie. My disc constantly at
 99% - 100%, sometimes randomly GPU skips to 99% and RAM is still way over what it should be. After this second USB boot it got a little better as far as numbers go, but the laptop still wont run the most basic things, lagging everything out and even just plain
 crashing apps on launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually do not understand how microsoft don't have this update fixed, with people still having these kinds of problems, when I live where I live getting updates 2 months later than everyone else. Incredible. My laptop is now not fit as a 2nd grade calculator.
 Good job.</p>

<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now end of January 2018 and this problem still persists with updates that aren't ready for release. I have a Dell XPS Windows 10 box that was bricked with the infamous 1709 "upgrade". I worked over the weekend and wasted a good 6 hours removing, reseating
 cables, memory, etc thinking it was just a simple hardware problem. I did this many times removing hardware till I had a bare bones system. In my case when the update was installed, when I went to boot up the computer, I got nothing. Didn't make it to the
 POST. So..no I can't recover, reset, etc. It didn't boot and find the USB drive that was my emergency boot disk. The PC was powered on, but there was no activity. I have 3 other PCs (all Dells) that I am now nervous of getting any new feature upgrades. The
 support from Microsoft is terrible as it appears it is better to act like nothing is wrong. There is no online chat support personnel to provide assistance like most companies these days. We are left complaining on a forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now end of January 2018 and this problem still persists with updates that aren't ready for release. I have a Dell XPS Windows 10 box that was bricked with the infamous 1709 "upgrade". I worked over the weekend and wasted a good 6 hours removing, reseating
 cables, memory, etc thinking it was just a simple hardware problem. I did this many times removing hardware till I had a bare bones system. In my case when the update was installed, when I went to boot up the computer, I got nothing. Didn't make it to the
 POST. So..no I can't recover, reset, etc. It didn't boot and find the USB drive that was my emergency boot disk. The PC was powered on, but there was no activity. I have 3 other PCs (all Dells) that I am now nervous of getting any new feature upgrades. The
 support from Microsoft is terrible as it appears it is better to act like nothing is wrong. There is no online chat support personnel to provide assistance like most companies these days. We are left complaining on a forum.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>And again, my previous complaint: no apparent way to tell Microsoft, "thanks, but NO thanks" to this or any other "upgrade". As another example, on an older Windows 7 machine there is an update to one of the drivers that fails every time. I am at least able
 to uncheck the update when new updates are ready, but there needs to be a way to say NO, NO, NO .. i don't ever want this update .. never .. ever .. go away! It's my computer, I have the right to say NO.

<p>Great Point!! Why can't I choose what gets updated? I understand that PC's need updated with all the security issues that are swarming the internet. But we should be able to defer an upgrade/update until it has been properly vetted to insure it doesn't brick
 machines. I'm now trying to get Dell to assist me as it seems Microsoft doesn't seem to think it's an issue. I have two other friends who are having similar problems with 1709 that has made their machines useless. We are lucky that we all have more than one.
 If it was my sole computer I'd be totally totally f*cked.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the difficulty when things won’t work the way they should. </span>
<span>I will be glad to assist you with the issue you are experiencing with the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Are you facing this issue after any recent update installed?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your PC?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>This issue could occur due to incompatible, outdated or corrupted device drivers. You can also check if detaching all other peripheral devices except for keyboard and mouse works out the issue. The issue (<strong>black screen</strong>) you’re facing
 could be most likely related to display drivers and could be resolved by updating the drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to refer to the suggestion by <strong>Sharath Srinivatava </strong>
from the following link and check if it helps you resolving the issue.</span></p>
