<h2>            Installing leap pad explorer device not recognized by Windows 7</h2>
                    I am trying to install the leap pad explorer but I am having a lot of difficulty. The leap frog connect application (CD)&nbsp;installed with no problems but when I connect the device with the usb nothing happens.&nbsp;It doesnt seem to be recognised by my computer
 I have tried adding the device through control panel and troubleshooting but it just says there were problems installing. I have even tried turning of the security but still nothing. Any ideas?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is the issue confined only to this USB device?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you try connecting to a different USB port?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check with a different USB port and see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to update chipset drivers from the system manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            How to install Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! Can anybody tell me how could I switch from Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit to 64-bit?</p>
<p>This is my question:-</p>
<p>1. I have purchased a retailed version Windows Vista Home Premium, the package only has the 32-bit media (DVD). I have found some website saying the product key for retail version of Windows is for both 32-bit and 64-bit so long as we use either the 32-bit
 or 64-bit on only one computer at a time. If I am correct, could anyone answer my following question?</p>
<p>2. Now I am planning to switch from 32-bit to 64-bit, my problem is that the retailed version of Windows I purchased only contain the 32-bit media:-</p>
<p>a) Is there any way I could install the 64-bit Windows?</p>
<p>b) Is there any way I could get a 64-bit media?</p>
<p>c) Could I use a friend's retailed Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit media to install on my computer? And after the installation, can I activate Windows with my product key?</p>
<p>Looking forward for answers, thank you.</p>

<p>OEM disk will work, as long as the Disk is Microsoft, not Dell, HP, etc</p>
<p>A MICROSFT&nbsp; Vista&nbsp;DVD is a proper Vista DVD.</p>
<p>As for 3,&nbsp;it will.</p>

<p>You do a clean install going from 32bit to 64bit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/1033/ordermedia/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/1033/ordermedia/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>Above link is how you get 64bit DVD, if&nbsp;you have a Retail licence.</p>
<p>You can use any Microsoft Vista 64bit DVD and use your 32bit Key as you say it is Retail Vista</p>
<p><span>Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

    <title>Delayed Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ameneses  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delayed Startup</h2>
                    <p>Recently I'm experiencing delayed startups with my system, which is a Dell Xps 8700 wity 16 GB RAM .</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware of, no new programs have been added and what I did up to now for trouble shooting is disable all the start up services except the Microsoft related. This did not change the delay and as the startup programs have not changed I did not
 tweak them.</p>
<p>What has me confused is that if I power off the computer and re-start the delay does not happen and it boots in less than 40 ", but if I just do a re-start without a power off, than it delays for about 2 minutes, which did not happen before (it used to boot
 in less than a minute).</p>
<p>Ive tried to find some program which can show me a log of the startups with time, but I can't find one.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate your advice.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First let me address the confusion you have on the restarting procedure delays. &nbsp;By default Windows 8 and 8.1 have on what is called Fast Startup. &nbsp;This only occurs when you shutdown the computer, and does not occur upon doing a restart. &nbsp;A restart is exactly
 that, a full restart. &nbsp;However, when Windows 8.1 has it's defualt set, shutting down the computer actually does what is called a hybrid shutdown. &nbsp;It does this by performing a partial hibernation which results in the kernal and device driver files being saved
 to the hard drive, similar to what a hibernation would do, so the computer can start back up faster when you turn it back on. &nbsp;Due to this, your startup is actually faster when you do it after the computer has been shutdown, over doing a restart which saves
 nothing and starts everything fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to determine what programs are starting up, right click on your status bar, and left click on Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the startup tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you have listed all the programs that start up during boot, along with a column that shows you what impact they have on the startup portion. &nbsp;You can also disable easily any of these by clicking on one and then clicking Disable. &nbsp;In Windows 8 and 8.1
 this is the preferred method to turning on or off startup programs, versus the old msconfig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always suggest that you first turn off all high impact programs that are not driver related. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and explanation on the rebooting. I went to start up and what I've been finding all the time that in the column "startup impact" , all I have is "not measured".</p>
<p>Any more ideas?</p>

            If it's reading not measure then my step would be to disable all of them, restart, and try enabling one by one, followed by a restart until you find the one that is causing the issue. &nbsp;Usually the list is not long on here, so it shouldn't take to much
 time to figure out which program is the culprit. &nbsp;

            <p>It &nbsp;was my understanding that once you installed Windows 10 that the computer BIOS would remember that you had previously installed the &nbsp;Windows 10 &nbsp; &nbsp;OS.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, &nbsp;why then is all of this nonsense necessary ????? &nbsp; &nbsp;I &nbsp;think LINUX sounds better all the time ! &nbsp; If &nbsp;the computer remembers that you had Windows 10 on it previously; &nbsp;then why go to all of this MESS ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would stand to reason then, &nbsp;that said computer would NOT &nbsp;allow &nbsp;Windows 10 to be installed with-out a &nbsp;valid COA &nbsp; .....Was this all a bunch of lies ?????</p>

            I downloaded malwarebytes from another machine onto a flash drive and installed it on my computer. I'm assuming it would already be the latest version, but I wouldn't know how to update it on my computer, since I have no networking options in safe mode.
 Even the 'Safe mode with networking' option doesn't give me anything. The first scan picked up a bunch of stuff from toolbars and downloads and the like, and it seemed to quarantine those files on my next safe mode reboot. When I scanned again I had 0 files
 that needed action. I still can't get in normally though. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8acvo79itiqd3vg/NewDMPs.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Problem with Wheel Mouse Optical setup</h2>
                    <p>When I modify the Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical setup, the modifications are not retained and I must redo them every time I reboot the computer.</p>
<p>It particularly applies to the Mouse Scroll (Roulette) setup. When I choose to roll up ou down one line at a time, it works for the duration of the session.</p>
<p>After the reboot, the setting returns to the default of 3 lines per roll.</p>
<p>It has always been like that (for many years).</p>
<p>The Mouse is a non wireless Wheel Mouse Optical 1.1A USB and PS2 Compatible (plugged in a USB port).</p>
<p>The Windows version is Windows 7 Family Edition.</p>
<p>The Driver is version&nbsp;9.5.172.0 dated 2013-12-12.</p>

                    I just tried installing Windows 10 Pro on my Windows 7 PC right now. I got 100% through the installation, and then I got to a screen that said it was going back to my old operating system. After it loaded up, I was back to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
The error code I got was: 8007002C. I looked for help, but I haven't found anything that can help me. Any ideas?

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Finally I FOUND A GUARANTEED&nbsp; SOLUTION TO Error Code 8007002</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1</strong>- All you have to do is to download a program by Microsoft called
<strong>Autoruns</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Autoruns">Autoruns Download Link</a></p>
<p><strong>2</strong>- in this program (Autoruns) you will find literally every program, service, drive, etc.. that starts during &amp; after system boot (startup).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A </strong>- In the program options, <strong>Make sure that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
(Hide Microsoft Entries)</span> &amp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(Hide Windows Entries)</span> are ticked,
</strong>This insures that you don't accidentally disable any of the files required by the system to function correctly</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B</strong><strong> -</strong> Now got the <strong>Logon Tab </strong>
&amp; untick (uncheck) all the entries, <strong>DO NOT DELETE the entries</strong> just untick them</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C </strong>- Then do the same thing in the&nbsp;<strong>Scheduled Tasks Tab</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>D </strong>- Also untick (uncheck) all the entries in the <strong>
Service Tab</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>E </strong>- Now go to the <strong>Drivers Tab, </strong>You have to be
<strong>EXTRA CAREFUL </strong>in this tab, Some of the entries in this tab are required by the system to boot &amp; unchecking them will definitely damage your system,
<strong>DO NOT Randomly untick</strong><strong> the entries of this tab</strong>, look at the
<strong>Description </strong>&amp; <strong>Publisher </strong>columns in the program to determine which entries to untick, The entries that should Be unticked are the:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (Graphic Drivers): </strong></p>
<p>in my case the graphic drive is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NVIDIA</span> so i unticked all the entries from NVIDIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>- (Network Drivers)</strong>: </p>
<p>Untick all the network drivers found, For me there was many <strong>(Media Tek Wireless, Huawei USB Modem, AnchorFree For Hotspot Sheild VPN, etc..)
</strong>as i said you have to look at the <strong>[Publisher column]</strong> to know what the entry represent</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (Audio Drivers): </strong></p>
<p>Like <strong>(RealTek HD Audio)</strong> or any other audio driver</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (3rd Party Drivers): </strong></p>
<p>Untick any 3d party driver, &amp; by third party drivers i mean the drivers added by programs you installed like
<strong>(Internet Download Manger WFP Driver) &amp; (Samsung USB Driver) etc..</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>F </strong>- Now go to the <strong>Codecs Tab</strong>, untick all the entries that could be unticked (some will remain ticked no matter what), Alternatively you can
<strong>uninstall the codec</strong> software installed in your computer Like (<strong>K-lite Codec) or (Shark007 Codec</strong> )
</p>
<p><strong>3- </strong>Now you can close the program &amp; proceed with the Windows 10 upgrade</p>
<p><strong>4-&nbsp;</strong>After the end of the Windows 10 upgrade process SURPRISE Windows Successfully upgraded to Windows 10, no more Restore Previous System, no more Error Code 8007002</p>
<p><strong>5-</strong> After The Upgrade, run the (Autoruns) program &amp; tick all the entries you unticked previously</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I&nbsp;tried the anti-virus route. I removed&nbsp;Avast, and also Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware which I used for occasional scans. Then for reassurance installed MS's Security Essentials, and tried again to upgrade to Win10. This time, much to my amazement

<h2>            Incorrect wifi system tray icon &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I am connected to wireless internet, and airplane mode is not on. &nbsp;Nevertheless, there is no network icon in my system tray. &nbsp;Instead, there is an airplane icon, and when I mouse over it, this message pops up: "Not connected - Wireless communication is
 turned off." &nbsp;To reiterate, this is incorrect; I am connected and it is working fine. &nbsp;But I would like a workable network icon in my system tray, so that I don't have to open the control panel to access my network settings. &nbsp;I saw a similar post, and the
 questioner was instructed to run 'sfc /scannow' in an administrator enabled command prompt. &nbsp;I did so, and no errors were found. &nbsp;Please help!

            <p>No No No No. MICROSOFT NEEDS TO ACTUALLY <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">READ</span></strong> RESPONSES if they want to act on them. I got the upgrade last night, and this morning - PLEASE READ THIS:<br />
<br />
AIRPLANE MODE SHOWS IN THE TRAY AND THE LOCK SCREEN<br />
<br />
BUT IT IS NOT ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse over shows that the internet is not connected, yet when you click on it, the connection is clearly shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - AND MICROSOFT ENGINEER - I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER - Somebody screwed up, and the icon is in reverse mode, or stuck on airplane (can't quite determine which).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix - MAKE SURE IT SHOWS THE "CONNECTED" ICON when the computer is CONNECTED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get a tepid response or auto response like the previous one to this thread, the whole thread will go immediately to MSNBC, CNN, FOX, and computer related forums, and not look too good for Microsoft, simply reinforcing a point of view that many people
 have concerning how inaccessible and uncaring they are.<br />
<br />
AGAIN - THE CONNECTION IS FINE. IT WORKS. IT <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
IS</span> CONNECTED. THE NOTIFICATION ICON IN THE TRAY AND THE LOCK SCREEN FOR ME (and evidently millions of others) SHOWS THAT IT IS IN AIRPLANE MODE. PLEASE RESPOND THAT YOU GET THIS, AND THAT IT WILL BE FIXED. AND YES, BASED ON THAT LAST RESPONSE AND THIS
 SITUATION, I AM UNDERSTANDABLY FRUSTRATED!</p>

            <p>i can confirm everything the previous posters have stated is true.</p>
<p>i just updated to Windows 10 build 1511 and now the tray icon shows the airplane icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>but WiFi is disabled .. (also disabled in Device Manager)</p>
<p>im using the Ethernet connection but the tray does not show this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there's no option or setting that can fix this.<br />
i've looked through out Control Panel..<br />
</p>
<p><strong>ie</strong>. here's a screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d97ee5-236e-4f94-930a-9cf8235c34cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d97ee5-236e-4f94-930a-9cf8235c34cf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>usually.. if WiFi is disabled.. the square Network icon should display.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>FYI</strong>: i have no problems w/connection.. just the icon is incorrect for the connection type being used.<br />

            <p>OK.. figured out the problem and solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: when Airplane Mode is <strong>On</strong> (<em>WiFi is disabled</em>) &gt; Windows 10 incorrectly displays Airplane Icon</p>
<p>- it should display the Ethernet Icon because WiFi has been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Turn Airplane Mode <strong>Off</strong> (<em>enable WiFi</em>) &nbsp;and Windows 10 will display the Ethernet Icon</p>
<p>- then if you want Airplane Mode On &gt; disable WiFi card via Device Manager</p>

            This doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; For me, it is displaying the airplane icon even though wifi is not in fact disabled.&nbsp; WiFi is working fine, and airplane mode is off, and yet it still will only display the airplane icon.<br />

<p>I have managed to resolve the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the <strong>login screen</strong> (ie before you load W10 by typing in your PIN or password), click the Aeroplane icon near the bottom right of the screen. Then click the slider to turn of Aeroplane mode (and thus enable Wireless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login to W10. The Wireless connection icon (with the connection-strength indicator) should be restored.</p>

                    <p>I was a happy player, I had fun on Live, but the Xbox One S, SN °. 127005662548 started to give problems in the resolution of the video, does not leave the low resolution 640 x 480p, it was after I updated to this new interface of the OS, already tried everything, install OS1 via USB mode, change TV, change the HDMI cable, but the console still does not recognize the TV's resolution. Now I'm a sad player.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Edition 64, Bluescreen, BugCheck 4A, Probably caused by &#58; ntkrnlmp.exe</h2>
                    Okay so for the past week I've been getting bluescreened by Windows for something. I've formulated a theory and tested it, so far it seems every time i install some new program, bluescreen starts happening. I took up the error codes and googled something
 and figured out it's 4A, meaning its a hardware \ driver error, but I can't figure out which one or what ot do with it. I ran the debugging tools and came up with this code, could you explain to me what to do to fix this?<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi Rcls0053,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The error log file that you have posted does refer to a driver fault with the process name being ‘acs.exe’.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>ACS.exe</span></strong><span> is
<span>Atheros Wireless LAN</span></span></span><span><span>
</span><span><span>file which was most likely on your computer the day you first acquired it, but it may have been installed by you also. Always verify where it is located on your hard drive,
 as this makes sure it is not spyware or adware simply placed elsewhere on your computer, and using the same name in an attempt to fool you. This acs.exe program is part of the wireless LAN task and will provide features related to this. This will also appear
 in your startup services. This is not considered trojan, spyware or virus related, and is considered a safe file till the file appears to be placed on your hard disk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the file does not appear to be placed on the hard disk and appears in some windows system files then I would suggest you to perform an online
 virus and malware scan on your computer. </span><span>In that case, you may refer to the below links to perform the online scan on your computer -</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the file is properly placed then as the file is related to your wireless tasks I would suggest you to check for the network adapter drivers on
 your computer –</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check the status of the wireless network card driver/adapter and try updating the driver if needed.<br />
</span><span>Follow the steps to check for the Network Adapter in the device manager:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Click
<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click <strong>
System</strong>, and then click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>In Network Adapter, expand Network Adapter, right-click the devices listed. Here you will get the device listed.<br />
Check if you have any exclamation or cross marks alongside the devices listed. If you do have then there is issue with the adapter installed.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>You may right click and uninstall the driver.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Now restart the computer and let the computer automatically detect the driver and then check.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the below mentioned link to update the drivers using windows update-<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists I would also suggest you to manually download and install the drivers from the manufacturer website and check if the issue
 gets resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

<h3> burce999  say:</h3>
<h2>            64 bit VS 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Could you let explain me exactly, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1-what is differently between 32 bit windows and 64 bit windows?&nbsp;I mean the main important!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-I heard that, Application with 32 bit designed for 32 bit windows , but when i tried to load on 64 bit windows, it working but some 32 bit program not support.</p>
<p>So Why????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3-When we need to use 32 bit (Programs or Windows) or 64 bit (Programs or Windows)????</p>
<p>4-If i buy a laptop, Which bit of WIndows should i go for? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            <p>The difference is just the type of processor. At a basic level, it's how many paths are available in the processor for simultaneous computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>64-bit computers are more modern, allow you to take advantage of more memory, and are faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs built for 32-bit computers will work fine on a 64-bit computer because Windows has the ability to mimic a 32-bit computer (they call this WoW, or "Windows on Windows").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it's nearly impossible to buy a computer that isn't 64-bit, and I would not recommend it even if you had the choice.</p>

            <p>The primary difference between 32 bit and 64 bit <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Windows</span> is the address space available so how much memory can be used</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;32 bit address bus can only access a maximum of 4GB memory. If you were to install more the excess would be ignored. Due to other technical issues even with 4GB installed if you were to look at the system properties you would find that is only has around
 3.2 GB available (there are slight variations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>64 bit can access up to 16 terabytes of memory although different versions of Windows have lower limits. This means that with more memory applications can remain in active memory instead of having to&nbsp;be swapped out in virtual memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some true 64 bit applications although the majority in active use are 32 bit natively, the program specification should make it clear if there is a particular need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the minimum specification for 64 bit Windows is 2GB vs 1 for 32 bit. This has to be remembered because if you have only 4GB of memory although it would all be used with 64 bit the extra memory demand would wipe out most if not all the extra. If you
 are considering 64 bit purely on the basis of more memory you should be looking to install

            <p>You have your opinion..... I just credit people with more sense,, one of the commonest upgrades installed is more memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His opening question was "what is the difference between 64 bit WINDOWS and&nbsp;32 bit WINDOWS".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is no 32 bit PC on the general market the processor is irrelevant. The MAIN difference is memory support. End of... Most commercial programs are either 32 bit only or will detect and run in 64 bit mode if detecting the O/S supports it.</p>

            <p>Ignore that little spat, it is against forum guidelines to comment on other posts unless technically incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your other questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>How programs behave depends on when and how well written. For example almost all XP computers&nbsp;sold were 32 bit, programmers writing in that era may not have fully taken into account the implications of the difference even&nbsp;though it was well documented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows itself recognises programs needing the 32bit environment and will support it. Only with that caveat above but that is not a problem with Windows but the program. I know of a few bespoke programs that do not like 64 bit, commercial ones should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buying 32 vs 64? Only go for 32 bit if you know something you want to do will only work properly on that system, or if you are ordering less than 4GB RAM and are unlikely to be able to upgrade later. Otherwise&nbsp;specify 64 bit Windows but with&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">at
 least</span> 4GB RAM, a little more if possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 computer keeps turning off&#33;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Ultimate. Once I log in, the screen goes black and I can't see it. It does say Windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown, but i have to put my face right up to it to barely see that. I have taken everything off my Compaq 610, and
 then reinstalled just the windows 7 and it still does the same thing. It works fine in Safe Mode. &nbsp;If I leave it on, it jsut keeps restarting over and over, but the same thing keeps happening<br />
<br />
<div>That happens, now when I turn it on, it just turns right back off</div>

<h2>            Cannot find camera in Device Manager after window 10 update.</h2>
                    <p>Machine is Dell inspiron 15 7000 Gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It constantly working properly before the update. And I did update only because windows just kept pop up during gaming and don't give the option that cancel the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the issue I tried to follow the FAQ, but the device manager didn't recognize the camera at all. I tried to follow one community threads and goto Dell official website for BIOS upgrade, but the most recent BIOS still unable to recognize the camera.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that this is due to driver conflicts after the recent update. To properly isolate this camera issue, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows 10 version/build is currently installed on your computer? To check, type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search option.</li><li>Did you encounter any error messages?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling the recent update that could be causing this issue and test the issue again?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you contact your device manufacturer to check the compatible drivers should work with the build of Windows 10 that you have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are eager on getting this resolved for you, we will wait for your feedback.</p>

            Hi andyandlily,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Forum<br />
<br />
Windows Mail stores your email, folders for newsgroups, and account settings in its own storage folder. By default, this storage folder is placed on the C drive, under your username in the AppData\Local\Microsoft\ Windows Mail directory.<br />
<br />
In vista and windows 7 the path is C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Mail storage folder.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to try to below steps to backup messages from windows mail and export them to windows live mail.<br />
<strong><br />
Steps :</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This method uses the traditional 'Drag and Drop' approach. Some may find this approach more familiar or easier.<br />
<br />
Drag Messages from Windows Mail to an Explorer Folder<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a new folder using Windows Explorer on the desktop(e.g. WMDragEmail)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create sub-folders in the new folder with identical names as the folders in your Windows Mail mail account<br />
- Inbox, Outbox, Sent, etc<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Windows Mail<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resize each window to fit on the desktop(one for the new folder and one for Windows Mail)<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switch to Windows Mail and select messages from a Windows Mail folder e.g Inbox<br />
- Control A can be used to Select All<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag those messages to the identical named sub-folder in the earlier created Windows Explorer folder.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat for each Windows Mail folder(Outbox, Sent,etc)<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close Windows Mail<br />
<br />
<strong>Drag Messages from an Explorer Folder to Windows Live Mail</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resize again to show two windows--the Explorer folder and Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure an email account is created<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag the messages from the Windows Explorer folder to the like named folder in Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />

<p>Hello OXF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would've PM'd a mod but they wouldn't know if they'd got it because there's no notification now when you get a PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't log in with my Gold account (FatMond), get a funny error message and have no email or anything. Second time in a week, a friendly American mod sorted it last time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate a response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mond (GT: FatMond)</p>

<p>That is the error. Nice to know that I get a quicker response from a good forum reg than anyone who actually works for these people. Although it would be nice to know what the suspension is for. Cheers DC
