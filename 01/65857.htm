<h2>            xbox won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t output in HD, but will output SD</h2>
                    
<p>hi</p>
<p>I used to connect my xbox 360 through a DVI adapter on an HDMI cable to a monitor, which worked fine for ages, but then one day it suddenly stopped working. I tried a couple different cables and adapters, they didn't work either. The xbox did output fine
 through scart to an old SD TV through the VGA cable. It will also output SD fine through SCART to a new 1080 TV.</p>
<p>However, if you flick the switch on the VGA cable to HD, the screen goes black, with 'no video signal', although sound carries on playing. And if you put an HDMI cable in, there's no sound or video, and it looks like the xbox isn't booting properly, and
 won't connect with the controller, with the green light going round in circles, although the TV does react to the signal, but again displays 'no video signal'.</p>
<p>I've tried resetting the display options, I've tried 3 different HDMI cables. There's no setting to change on the TV to allow HD sources or whatever, I've been through the instructions and menus with a fine tooth comb.</p>
<p>I'm guessing the xbox must have a fault? Any suggestions gratefully received</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>I've worked out why I'm not getting video with the component cable, because I don't have the right HD cable connection for the TV. So really it's just the HDMI that's misbehaving.</p>

<p>I've tried putting the TV into game mode. I've tried plugging in the component cable to see the display, then changing the display settings on the xbox to HD, then plugging in the HDMI cable. I guess it's an HDMI handshake issue? Or a fault in the HDMI port
 on the xbox?</p>

<p>It's kind of a miracle the method was working in the first place.</p>
<p>The console supports VGA cable usage, but HDMI to DVI setups are not supported by the system, even though third party companies make products for it.</p>

<p>[quote user="Dev70"]I'm guessing the xbox must have a fault?[/quote]Based on the other posts you've made in this thread,&nbsp;that sounds&nbsp;the most likely explanation.[quote user="Jameser78"]It's kind of a miracle the method was working in the first place.[/quote]No,
 it's not. HDMI and DVI carry the same video data. HDMI was also designed to be backwards compatible with DVI from a signaling perspective. The extra audio data that HDMI can carry does not normally cause a problem.[quote]HDMI to DVI setups are not supported
 by the system,[/quote]They're not supported from an official perspective because MS never made an HDMI to DVI cable. They're supported from a console perspective as MS supports manual resolution selection when the connected display does not enumerate its display
 options to the console.</p>

<p>yes. reset the display settings. also manually changed the resolution and then swapped the cables. anyway, it's outputting HD successfully through the VGA. looks like it's just a fault with the HDMI port, i suppose.</p>

<p>Each cable/port on the Xbox has separate video settings that get remembered. I'd unplug ALL cables from the Xbox except for HDMI and do a video reset with only that plugged in. If you've already been through that, I don't have any other ideas. You could
 try a different HDMI port on the TV, a different HDMI cable, or flipping the cable around - plug the end that was in the TV into the Xbox, and the end that was in the Xbox into the TV.</p>

<p>I have kind of the same issue. I have always used xbox with hdmi on my TV and its worked fine. For the past month or so i have been using my computer monitor that has HDMI. Today i tried moving my xbox back to my tv and now the TV wont accept the signal.
 It says weak signal. I tried the whole display reset, u could see that the xbox was restarting and resetting but it didnt work. Other components work fine on the tv with the same port and cable. Even tried it on another TV but still the same problem. The xbox
 still however works fine on the monitor. maybe it was a bad patch? Im stumped.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to change my main monitor to the nvidia graphics card so I can stream better&#63;</h2>
                    When I use Obs&nbsp; it runs on my Nvidia Graphics card and I get a black screen. However, when I run it with the Integrated Graphics I can see my main screen (Laptop screen) but the stream is far worse and lags and makes it almost impossible to stream from.
 I was wondering if it was at all possible to make my Laptop Default monitor run off of the Nvidia Graphics card.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />For this you should change Nvidia settings.
<br />
<br />Open the Nvidia Control Panel (right-clicking on the desktop or you can find the option within the notification area of the Taskbar)
<br />
<br />Select Manage 3D Settings under 3D Settings.
<br />
<br />Click on the Program Settings tab and select the program you want to choose a graphics card for from the drop down list.
<br />
<br />Choose the 'preferred graphics processor' in the drop down list.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions

            Hi.
<br />My name is Miles.
<br />
<br />	If your game is running with an integrated card instead of the dedicated one you will notice less fluid performance or problems when running the game. The solution is usually to switch to the dedicated card.
<br />
<br />	Most laptops (and, sometimes, desktops) have more than one GPU: one integrated and one dedicated. The integrated part of the processor and ensures that your PC makes use of the screen, but has no dedicated GPU. However, some more demanding tasks require a more powerful GPU, which in most cases is not integrated.
<br />
<br />	If you are not sure if your PC has more than one GPU, you can easily check it by opening the Device Manager and navigating to Display Adapters. Your GPU or GPUs will be displayed there.
<br />
<br />	Toggle to the dedicated Nvidia card:
<br />
<br />• First, open the Nvidia Control Panel. One way to do this is by right clicking on an empty area of your desktop and then choosing Nvidia Control Panel.
<br />
<br />• Navigate to the 3D Settings&gt; Manage 3D Settings.
<br />
<br />• Open the Program Settings section and select the game from the drop-down list.
<br />
<br />• Next, choose the preferred graphics card for this program in the second drop-down list. There you should see your Nvidia card as a Nvidia High-Performance Processor.
<br />
<br />	Finally, save the changes. Now your game should run with your dedicated Nvidia card.

            I am not having trouble running games. This is a recent problem that has just started with my OBS. It use to capture my whole laptop monitor and now it only shows a black screen when I run it with nvidia. It works when I run OBS with the Integrated, however
 the stream does not work as well. In the settings is there a certain option that I can add that will make it where my whole monitor will be displayed while streaming.<br />

            • On the desktop, press right click and open the NVIDIA control panel.
<br />
<br />• You will get 3 options (At least from the laptop), choose the second "Control 3D configuration".
<br />
<br />• In the section on the right, you get 2 parts, global and program settings.
<br />
<br />• Choose "Program settings"
<br />
<br />• In point 1. Choose the OBS program, in case it does not come out, add it from your location.
<br />
<br />• In point 2. Choose the integrated graphics option
<br />
<br />	And with that, it should work. Luck.

<p>This does work. I have streamed a few times with it on the integrated graphics However the streaming has taken a hit in quality (super laggy and skipping frames to the point where it is unwatchable) Is there a way to fix this. I have streamed from this laptop
 and from this internet in the past and have had zero trouble and now that I am having problems with the Graphics card these problems have started. I was wondering if you have any advise on ways that might be able to fix it from lagging or skipping frames.
 Thanks for your help so far.<br />

            C6 Clickfree is an imaging program - you can not image Windows to a different computer because
<span>Windows is not designed to be moved from one motherboard to another.
<br />
<br />
You can restore the image to an external hard drive - check the instructions for </span>
C6 Clickfree to see how.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there<br />
probably are Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />

<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with
<br />
TouchPad entries) and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on
<br />
lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad -
<br />
Driver's Tab - Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying
<br />
drivers), now RIGHT CLICK on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in
<br />
it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad
<br />
from working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except we need to
<br />
clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
This utility also helps to control the TouchPad :<br />

            <p>Sorry I didn't get back sooner. My husband has been in the hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your question.&nbsp; The problem I have is only on Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;error message doesn't always pop up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes every email opens without a problem.&nbsp; This morning I had one email that had an error message. The rest of the emails opened normally.
 Then there are days when every email has the error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing that I can pin down as why this happens.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this&nbsp;info will help but I found this&nbsp;in some notes I'd made:</p>
<p><a href="https://host18.3agsdc.net/aprimo/etrackaspx?DSN=b9ca5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://host18.3agsdc.net/aprimo/etrackaspx?DSN=b9ca5</a>&nbsp; (I think there may be more to this URL</p>
<p>but it didn't show. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message I receive is: "There is a problem sending the command to the program".&nbsp; If I click several times the emails will open &amp; I won't have a problem with that particular email again.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Edna RuthHarrell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your time posting in Microsoft Community and we apologize for the delayed response. If I may ask, are you getting the same error message when accessing the account using the web interface? If yes, what browser are you using when you got it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a lot of possible reasons as to why you received that error message. However, I have some options for you to assist you in rectifying this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure that the browser that you're using is set to allow pop-ups. If you're using Internet Explorer, here's how to do it:</p>
<p>a. Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Go to Tools tab then<strong> Internet Options</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Click on Privacy tab. Under Pop-up Blocker, make sure that there's a check mark on the box beside Turn on Pop-up Blocker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you're using other browser, please contact your browser support to assist you on how to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Change the default browser that you're using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the same issue persist after doing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Configuring Volume Activation Management Tool on Win Server 2012 R2</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>I trust you're well</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed VAMT role to my windows server 2012 R2 all successfully.</p>
<p>I am facing issues on pre-configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My company has a Volume Licensing agreement for MAK licenses, as far as I understand is that I need a KMS license to make VAMT to work as shown in the below image:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed5f6eea-0072-4fff-9276-c447d60abd4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed5f6eea-0072-4fff-9276-c447d60abd4e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>when i insert an MAK license it ends up with error:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7981926-5bb3-45e0-aa29-4e4de415356b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7981926-5bb3-45e0-aa29-4e4de415356b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite confused, I am not sure which license I should use (Windows Server license or any other) If there is any other way to make it work using a MAK license ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

            Hi Mahesh,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help! Unfortunately the first method made no change. I tried method two but i cant find the right instructions for my laptop. I bought the Lenovo G500AM i5, When it arrived I turned it on follwed the instructions, i thought. I inserted
 the driver disk after a couple of hours (stupidly). I'm not sure if i done something to the laptop or it came broke? Is there an online instruction on how to restore or refresh the laptop to its original state?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>May i also add that all the instructions came in chinese, no english!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope to speak soon!</div>

<h2>            Loud system sounds</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Problem is that I can't change loudness of the Windows notifications. There is "System sounds" volume mixer, but it doesn't change loudness of Windows tray notifications, and every such notify plays a maximal loud sound! It's annoying.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You spoke about two different things: Windows system sounds and tray notifications. There's a lot more in the tray than just Windows utilities. First thing is to figure out exactly what program or utility is making the sound.</p>

            It all really depends on how much you want a new console currently. I understand where you're coming from though. There's no precise time frame currently given for when a newer Xbox is due to be released. I would think that we have some time though.&nbsp;

<p>Hey Saint thanks for taking the time to bring this inquiry to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the concern on this particular matter but rest assured we are here to help. As of right now we don't have a new console coming out next year, it is in the works but nothing confirmed so in short, the Xbox One S will not be obsolete in 6 months
 and the controllers should work like if a controller that came with the Xbox One can be used with the Xbox One X. Hope this gives some peace of mind but let us know if we can further assist in this or any other issue or inquiry!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unknown on when the next console will be coming maybe 2020 or 2021. Plus Xbox has said the next console will work with current console accessories and games so my suggestion is you get an&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;one x and don't miss out.<br />

    <title>Marble Blast Ultra Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wang lung 5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marble Blast Ultra Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have been having a problem &nbsp;downloading Marble Blast Ultra. Recently, I went to a friends house and recovered my account on his xbox so I could use my account at his house. While I was there, I played Marble Blast Ultra on my account. The next day,
 when I played at my house, I had to recover my account on my xbox so I could play at my home. I wanted to play Marble Blast so i went to the Game Marketplace to download it to my harddrive. However, when I went to buy the game, there was no option to buy it.
 The only items I could buy were the three add-on packs. The game was not in my Game Library either. The only place it showed up was in the achievement progress page under my profile. So basically, I cannot play the game and I cannot buy the game, however it
 shows that I have still played the game on my account. I think it has something to do with me recovering my account at my friends house. It seems that the xbox recognizes that I have played the game and therefore does not allow it to show up in the Game Marketplace.
 But I dont think that the xbox knows the game is not downloaded to my harddrive. &nbsp;The xbox acts as though the game is downloaded to my xbox when, in reality, it isn't. Please help me. Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Windows Shutting Down Unexpectedly Following Upgrade to Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday evening, I upgraded my Windows 10 installation from the Creators Update to the Fall Creators Update using the Update Assistant - which went perfectly.&nbsp; So I am now running Version 1709 Build 16299.19.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afternoon while using it, around 3 hours of use it shutdown unexpectedly.&nbsp; I had Chrome open and I was going through some e-mails in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; The machine just dropped.&nbsp; I powered it back on and it came back up fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only configuration change to the laptop in the last week, is the upgrade to the Fall Creators Update and it never did this under the Creators Update.&nbsp; So the issue has only occurred following the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked through the Event Viewer and I have found the following events which were logged when this happened;</p>

            I ran SFC and DISM as well after each crash and they said there were no issues as well. I still am getting this crash though at random times (happened again a hour ago which makes 3 times now).<br />
<br />
For me it is as if the computer shuts down like it lost power and then 30 seconds later reboots it's self realizing it still has power. No crash log is created as a result (cause no BSOD or the like came up before hand), and I only get the event log error reports
 after the computer has booted back up saying the shut down was unexpected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I didn't have this issue at all before the update I installed on November 1st that updated me to the 1709 build/version. So I am pretty sure this Feature Update screwed something up. I did point a Microsoft Phone Support person to this thread already to try
 to help resolve my issue. They have me scheduled to talk with a Tier 2 tech (higher tier than them) on Monday to try to resolve things and I'll point them at this thread again so Microsoft will know about the issue one way or another even if they never respond
 to this thread.&nbsp;

That's a great question. You can right click on the Recycle bin, or if you are only using the touch screen, press and hold until a blue box appears around your finger, and touch Empty Recycle Bin.

<h2>            Slow&#47;glitchy usb mouse through Surface Pro 3 Dock with Surface Pro 4.</h2>
                    When I attach my Microsoft wireless desktop to my Surface Pro 3 Docking Station and plug in my Surface Pro4, the mouse gets very glitchy/laggy. When I connect the desktop to my SP4 through its built-in usb, the mouse works great. Any suggestions?

            Why did you link to the bluetooth troubleshooting when this is a problem with USB?&nbsp; I don't see bluetooth in the question, and I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; Lots of missed clicks and key presses with various USB devices.

</p><p>As Brian Marble points out this is not a bluetooth problem, this is a problem with my SP4 failing to reliably connect to a USB dongle through the SP3 docking station.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the confusion in the previous reply and let's try to address the issue. When did you first start noticing the issue and do you see the same issue when using the type cover for instance?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you connect the Surface to the docking station and run&nbsp;Windows updates manually. Once complete, restart the device and let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you use the Surface Dock updater as well? Does the issue persist even after re-plugging the mouse? Go to
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; scroll to the bottom of the window and tap/click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. Now look for "<strong>Mice and other pointing device</strong><strong>s</strong>" expand it and
<strong>uninstall</strong> all mouse drivers (HID-compliant mouse). <strong>Reboot / Restart Surface</strong> and see if the issue persists.</p>

It appears as if you have solved the problem yourself by using US layout or am I not understanding your issue?<br />

            <p>Sorry if I wasnt clear, when I set layout to US Im able to use apostrophes, but not use special accents or tilde.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only proves from a keyboard standpoint that the keys are working correctly, but when set to International and trying to use apostrophes, nothing happens, not even a single apostrophe shows and I cant apply accents to other vowels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I want to use a tilde, I should press the tilde character and then the system applies that accent to the next character (if applicable), if not it then just prints that accent alone. Thats how it should work, but right not thats not happening,
 Im not able to even print the accent on the screen, let alone put accent to a character.</p>

            Hi Keenu.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The message means another account is till logged in on the PC.  If yours is the only account then it is likely a bug.  
<br />
<br />There's fuller discussion of this here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/user-accounts-family-safety/97230-logout-warning-someone-else-still-using-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/user-accounts-family-...</a>

<br />
<br />What is the antivirus?   I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.  
<br />
<br /> If you want the best on-demand scanner install run Download and install Malwarebytes from <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />In it's Settings &gt; Protection &gt; Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits.  
<br />Then on Scan tab choose Threat Scan and Run Scan.  
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Next check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Accounts tab.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Recovering saved content from old Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the dreaded red ring of death on my original 20gb Xbox last&nbsp;month. GAME were offering a really good deal on a slim 250gb console&nbsp;with games I was planning to buy anyway (Forza 4 &amp; Battlefield 3) so it made financial sense to replace rather than repair
 (again).</p>
<p>However, just wondering what is the best method for retriving my saved games from my old hard drive and memory stick?</p>
<p>I've read you can get an official data transfer cable but wondered how this would work with the memory stick itself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I had got a score of 995 on Forza 3 with an extensive amount of cars and money. I've been playing Forza 4 a lot since I got but noticed that there is an achievement for copying a file from Forza 3. Obviously I can't do this at the&nbsp;moment as all
 my game data is on my dead&nbsp;console, but will this unlock if I copy all my old game saves?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, bit to go with there but I would really appreciate any help!</p>

<p>Is the memory stick a USB drive or is it one of the Xbox Memory Units that you plugged into the special slot on the front of the old console? If it's the Memory Unit, unfortunately there isn't a way to get the info off of that using your new slim. The only
 way to do it is find an old xbox console, plug in the memory unit and copy the data off of it to a USB drive that's formatted for the xbox. Then you can use the USB drive to move it to your new console.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Service Pack 1 &#40;SP1&#41; Error Code 80070017</h2>
                    <p>I just formatted both of my hard drives and did a clean install of Windows 7 from the disc because I was getting nonstop BSOD's after start up previously. Upon attempting to update Windows 7, I got the first round of important updates and several optional
 updates to install just fine, but when I restarted and went to install the rest of the important updates and optional update quite a few of the updates failed and now the SP1 wont install. Now, I've seen plenty of threads on this subject, and none with any
 answers that solved it for me. When I try to install SP1 it fails, every single time. Like the title says, I get error code 80070017. I'm using the Windows Update program to try and install this, but even when using the SP1 Installer from the windows website
 it fails. Someone suggested I run chkdsk, and when I tried that it froze at about 11% and then went into a BSOD. Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>

    <title>how to move pics from emails to folder in my pics - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to move pics from emails to folder in my pics</h2>
                    i am trying to answer my question as they have come back to say that they dont know how. &nbsp;I have chrome and it does most of this for you. &nbsp;Click on the pic in the email and download it. &nbsp;It will ask what you want to do. Check on save as.... &nbsp;It should
 now go down to the lower left corner. &nbsp;When you click this , one of the options is 'to see in folder'. &nbsp;See chrome saves it in your file manager. &nbsp;From there you just highlight the title of the pic - which can be a jpg #- and highlight my pics or pictures
 and it will go there. &nbsp;Then you can move it into a new folder or to another folder. &nbsp;Hope this helps. &nbsp;sue
