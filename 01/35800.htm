<h2>            ,,An operating system wasn&#39;t found.&#34; after factory reset</h2>
                    <p>I had a lot of junk in my computer, so I decided to delete it. I thought that I could just simply do factory reset. When I did it the screen showed ,,Resseting this pc" I leaved it alone and did other things. When I came back there was an error. I don't
 remember what actually they showed, but I remember I choosed to try again. After about 30min. they showed me the same error. So then I remember I choosed to restart this computer. When pc restarted, it showed white letters in black screen ,,An operating system
 wasn't found. Try disconnecting any drives that don't contain an operating system. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart". I tried to search for the solution, but it didn't work... What should I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Sorry for my bad English</p>

    <title>Windows Update Error Code 8024402F - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update Error Code 8024402F</h2>
                    Hi, I had not updated windows for a while, and I thought it would be a good idea to update it. I had disabled checking for updates automatically so I go to check for an update manually and I get error code 80244022, I seemed to have fixed that, but now
 when I go to Check for an Update I get error code 8024402F, I have tried all the options that are applicable to me in any of the help articles connected to this error code but to no avail, also when I tried to run the FixIt it sais the troubleshooter is temporarily
 unavailable and it had an issue downloading one or more components and cannot run the troubleshooter, so I find the updated FixIt for Windows Update and it says the same thing. When I first got the computer I could update fine but after doing a Clean Install
 of Windows near the start of this year I have not been able to update which is weird. I am at my wits end, can anyone please help me?

<h2>            Surface 3 charging problems.</h2>
                    <p>We bought our son a Surface 3 in August last year. Never charged to full capacity from the start and the issue just got worse. Microsoft replaced both the computer and charger. My son is now experiencing the same problem with the replacement. It does not
 charge fully, ever and the charge does not last long enough for his day at school :( . It was a very expensive purchase and we were hoping it would last him until the end of sixth form but we are now faced with buying a replacement sadly.</p>

            <p>I purchased a Surface 3 in October 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned it in December 2015 and bought another, which lasted until June 2016, when I tried a new charging&nbsp;cable from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That Surface&nbsp;unit totally stopped charging when in use and was returned to Microsoft...and I&nbsp;just received my third Surface 3 from Microsoft this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am on my third Surface 3 in&nbsp;ten months. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All the units had charging/ cable/ microUSB port&nbsp; problems....it's a very bad design and execution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I had a Surface RT which didn't even last two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I sympathise with your issues.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My son always uses minimum brightness and energy saving mode. He updates it regularly with Microsoft updates. The unit is currently plugged in and is reading 75% charged and not charging despite the light on the charger being on. It is really unpredictable
 and cannot be relied upon to do a whole school day. Three and a half hours is the limit which just doesn't work for a school day of 8.30 am - 5.30 pm. He says it very&nbsp;rarely charges to 100% despite a whole night of charging&nbsp;and when it does, he switches it
 off for school and when he switches it back on the battery life has reduced to 50% and he hasn't even used it! It hasn't charged to 100% for a while now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: after 2 hours of charging, 75% has REDUCED to 60% ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>The charging issues of the Surface 3 are well documented here, on reddit and other places. What you will need to do is purchase a USB charger from places like Amazon or some other retailer which can charge the tablet. The recommended one can be found at
 the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-Foldable-iPhone/dp/B012WLUKHC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable sleep mode and always <strong>shut down</strong> the tablet when not in use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">DO NOT PUT IT TO SLEEP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done the above you should have a pleasant computing experience thereafter.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft Support&nbsp;‚Äì Ovi</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well what a day! </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did the trouble shooting that Ovi suggested, after waiting for the unit to gather enough charge to do so. Uninstalled the battery driver and switched back on for 4 hours. No charging.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Embarked upon trying to call Microsoft about this and to try to get a refund...this is after all our second unit and we have now lost confidence. Our son is entering important GCSE years and needs his laptop to last for longer than 3 hours!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well, attempted several calls this morning, ‚Äúexperiencing high volumes of calls‚Äù and tried an waited several times before giving up at around 10 minutes.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Managed to actually speak to someone after a 15 minute or so wait this afternoon only to be told that this connection given to me by the technical department 2 days ago was not correct and was diverted. Waited 27 minutes and gave up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tried again and waited&nbsp;25 minutes only to be disconnected. Tried again, details explanation over and over again only to be given an 0800 number. 0800 026 0329 Called this after another long wait only to be told that they would not issue a refund on the
 basis that I had only had two units so far and not 3? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Really I said? I don‚Äôt want a replacement. I want a refund. My son‚Äôs education is important and he needs a computer that meets his needs. I will transfer you....25 minutes later I had waited enough.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have had enough of Microsoft, their products and terrible customer service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can honestly say that I would rather buy a computer from Currys...I hate to think how much the&nbsp;0800 number phone calls have cost
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you Microsoft for a day of my life wasted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Clare Farrant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a real issue with the fact that the Microsoft policy is that they will not issue a refund until they have replaced the unit 3 times. This is now in the realms of affecting my sons ability at school and this unit was purchased on the student scheme.
 I have no choice now but to accept their replacement in which I have no confidence and to go and buy an alternative too so that my son can have a computer that works.

            I too am now having the problem of it being plugged in to charge but says not charging and how ironic it starts right after my warranty expires. I'm so extremely upset with microsoft. I have had nothing but problems. I bought this for school and am a single
 mom of 4. I can't afford another computer right now. This has me in tears. I'm so frustrated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, Could not make commercial with microsoft. Had to send my unit back as well for not booting anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have as well the problem of charging. Plug in not charging or plug in and charging for a while...etc. Always must have a look on the battery status. As well take forever to charge. Like 5 hours for 50 % .</p>
<p>I have change the cable and bought a new radioshack wall usb charger. Now charging and hope this works out. But look like a problem with cable-charger and as well the micro usb on the tablet.
</p>
<p>Microsoft should better improve their OS instead of playing in a field already taken by more competent companies.</p>
<p>Hope this for a couple of dollars solve your problem. worth to try.</p>

            <p>Very good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually the problem is the cable, but sometimes the charger has to be changed as well. The thinner a cable is the more resistance it has and so the more voltage drop you experience across that cable. This is why earth cables on a house&nbsp;are always thick,
 so that they have the least resistance and pass the maximum amount of current without heating up in the case of a lightning strike. You would also see power cables in home wiring are also thick, so that they can carry the current required for all your equipment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing applies to USB cables. Unfortunately these cheap cables use very thin wires hence the voltage drops too far, the current therefore is too low and the tablet cannot charge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Voltage = Current X Resistance</p>
<p>
</p><p>or I=V/R so since the Voltage is fixed at whatever the adaptor gives out. If the resistance in the wire goes up. Current must come down. Which is where the problem is and why you have to change your cables.</p>

            Thanks for mentioning this case number. &nbsp;I tried contacting Symantec (who said contact Microsoft) and Microsoft about this issue. &nbsp;I met a similar response to jkvato, and was told I had to start a paid support case. &nbsp;I will be contacting Microsoft again
 and mentioning that case number to see if this issue can be escalated further. &nbsp;Hopefully Microsoft can fix this fast.

            They didn't tell me to start a paid support case. And if they had, it would have gotten unpleasant.&nbsp; We should not have to pay for Microsoft support because our Symantec product was broken by a Microsoft update. If Microsoft needs to be paid, then Microsoft
 &amp; Symantec need to work out who is going to pay for Microsoft's time.&nbsp; But the payer should not be us.

<a href="http://bemis/8/Pages/3092401_en-US.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bemis/8/Pages/3092401_en-US.aspx</a> then they will give the hotfix. You might have to request to speak to a technical lead (but hopefully not).</p>

<h2>            Spider-Man&#58; Edge of Time - Anyone got it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The title really does say it all; has anyone got <em>Edge of Time</em>, and if so, what do you think of it?<br />
<br />
My copy turned up from Activision this morning, and so far I've only put about an hour into it, but I did quite enjoy that hour.</p>
<p>- Combat was fairly typical button mashing, but felt fun enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Controls felt a little imprecise when web-swinging and wall-crawling. Doesn't help that the first hour I played was all set indoors. Spidey ain't meant for indoors, ****!</p>
<p>- Story seems pretty interesting so far, even if it does raise about a million points on the base laws of physics and hypotheotical.... I'll stop there.</p>
<p>- Voice acting seemed solid.</p>
<p>- Anti-Venom!!!</p>

<p>So what do you guys think, or are you planning on picking it?<br />
<br />
Wolf&nbsp;</p>

<p>Love it except for the Spider-Man 2099 free-fall sections. I've reached one and I simply can not get past it because of my poor reaction times.<br />
<br />
It feels very much like Shattered Dimensions and I loved the little dig about the Spider-Marriage near the beginning.<br />
<br />
The freefall section has killed it for me though.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Spider-Man: Web of Shadows is the best Spider-Man game I've played.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK here's what I don't get, you have Spiderman 1 which was an improvement on the previous ones, you then Have Spiderman 2 considered the defining thing of the genre then you have the still damn fine Spiderman 3, then Ultimate spiderman which was still good.
 So why have the modern Spiderman games removed the things that made 2 ,3 and ultimate work by making linear levels when Spiderman was meant to swing through the city, I'd actually get back to the spiderman games if they hadn't started going backwards. Though
 with the comic One more day you could say the games are following the comics, going backwards for no apparent reason other than morons behind the wheel.</p>

I agree completely, mate. The indoor setting of Edge of Time just doesn't suit web-slinging at all. Spidey needs massive open spaces to swing in! I understand them trying to do something different with the games, but enclosed spaces simply don't suit this style
 of character</p>

 a shame they've gone backwards i.m.o. &nbsp;I think i will pick up a preowned copy of spiderman3 for him...</p>

<p>[quote user="hobblejp"]OK here's what I don't get, you have <strong>Spider-Man</strong> 1 which was an improvement on the previous ones, you then Have
<strong>Spider-Man</strong> 2 considered the defining thing of the genre then you have the still damn fine
<strong>Spider-Man</strong> 3, then Ultimate <strong>Spider-Man</strong> which was still good. So why have the modern
<strong>Spider-Man</strong> games removed the things that made 2 ,3 and ultimate work by making linear levels when
<strong>Spider-Man</strong> was meant to swing through the city, I'd actually get back to the
<strong>Spider-Man</strong> games if they hadn't started going backwards. Though with the comic One more day you could say the games are following the comics, going backwards for no apparent reason other than morons behind the wheel.[/quote]Web of Shadows is
 a free-roam game.<br />
<br />
You can swing around the City as much as you want and don't have to touch the main storyline until you want to. Taking part in the main storyline does change the type of enemies you come across though while free-roaming.<br />
<br />
The only complaint I have about Web of Shadows is the camera, which can occasionally throw you the most inopportune angle.<br />
<br />
It's a game well worth checking out if you liked the older Spider-Man titles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer . Now my turn- Yes, I tried. Over wi-fi. I believe it is IPhone 6. I don't know what is IOS - I am sure not the one who installed ))</p>
<p>Another thing- now I deleted Skype to try and download it again- here another problem. The system request my Apple ID password . Apparently I don't remember. Then to reset it I need to answer the security questions- apparently I can't remember them too../or
 to get instructions trough the email address I ve never used - so do not have access . Eah. I stuck</p>

            Hello Ahmad,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how this concerns you and I‚Äôll assist you with this.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>It is recommended to uninstall your antivirus as it is blocking your upgrade and you can reinstall it after the upgrade is done.
</p>
<div>Since, you do not want to uninstall your McAfee DLP agent you can Disable it and check if it helps.&nbsp;
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Reply with results to help you further.</p>

            <p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus or other security software&nbsp;that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription
 that has not expired, contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows
 10.</p>

I strongly suggest you avoid using third party Antivirus utilities until Windows 10 is released to the general public. Antivirus utilities require intimate access to the heart of Windows, new versions tend break a version of a AV utility not specifically designed for it. Since Windows 10 is going through rapid development, even third party Antivirus utilities that might offer support in another build might break in a future build.

    <title>Opening different file types Windows - Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevetaillon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening different file types Windows - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I do not understand why every time I sit down to do what should be a very simple task on the newest operating system turns out to be hours of aggravation and</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;disappointment. I am speaking specifically about viewing certain file types, attaching a picture to an email, or viewing a DVD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I guess if I was just using my laptop to click on apps all day life would be just wonderful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I need to do actual work.&nbsp; You would think having a laptop with Microsoft Windows 8 that opening a file would be a breeze.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why is it I have to configure a file to open using a list of 10 different apps ????&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why should I have to spend time associating a &nbsp;file type with a program????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why do I need to set up defaults????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why should I&nbsp;have to down load another email program to send a picture????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have to download additional programs to view a DVD ????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It&nbsp;is absolutely &nbsp;ridiculous !!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am a contractor and have been building Houses for 25years . I cant help but compare what I build to what software companies are building and how
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>every piece of software is either going to at sometime in the near future be out of date or incompatible with the old stuff you just bought.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So here's a scenario I think about quite often.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I build you house and hand you the keys to your brand new energy efficient home&nbsp;. You enter your new home and flick the switch to the lights in the hallway</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and nothing happens . You flick it again and again and nothing happens . You call me but of coarse I am not available. You leave a message and a couple hours</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>pass with you sitting in the hallway . I get your message and call you back and say if you want the lights to turn on you need to go to the service panel and</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>insert a circuit breaker , turn it on and you will have lights. You think I cant believe this Its a new House. You go to the service panel and to your amazement</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>there are 20 different circuit breakers. Some have a 15 written on&nbsp;them , some have a 20 on them , and&nbsp;the others&nbsp;have 30 or 50 on them . You scratch your head
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and think why am I doing this I just bought this new home and I cant even turn the lights on . You call me back and ask which one do I use to which I reply
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>well how long do you want the lights to stay on? , do you want to use a lot of energy ? Would you like the lights to dim?? Are you using fluorescent , condensing,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>or incandescent lights . ?&nbsp; This is &nbsp;where you loose it and respond with a " I&nbsp;JUST WANT THE FREAKING LIGHTS TO TURN ON&nbsp;"&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know this is probably an over exaggeration but you cant help but see my point .
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;actually have a ton of these examples. How about if you called me to fix your leaky&nbsp;roof and I said Sorry but I am going to have to replace your entire house</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>because the shingles I put on your house are no longer compatible with the windows and doors you have .
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Its no different to me when I call QuickBooks and ask them how I can print a pdf using windows 8 and they say sorry sir you need the newest addition of
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>QuickBooks . Which was a total lie . I fixed the problem myself.&nbsp; I will no longer be buying intuit products.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do have a&nbsp;question.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the safest program or app I need to play a DVD . ??&nbsp; The reason I am kind of upset &nbsp;&nbsp;about this one little simple question is because since I have
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>become more familiar with Operating Systems and computers the more I get completely aggravated with the entire programming world.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We lost power in our house last week . I thought no worries I can watch a&nbsp;DVD on my laptop. Guess what after hours of searching I could not open the DVD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I didn't have wifi so I couldn't search the net or download additional programs.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was completely put off. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why on earth would an Operating System that is supposed to be the newest and best thing on the planet not be able to play a DVD ????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Totally unreal. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;cant an &nbsp;operating system be set up to open every file type that there is ??? Why does there have to be so many options???</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have become a society of consuming and customization .&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Computers are supposed to save us time but lately it seems the life is being sucked out of me every time I try to do something on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't want to read directions on how to associate a program with a file type . I have way to much to do than&nbsp;to sit there and learn every file type and
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>what they do . When I try and view a file I don't want a list of programs to pop up like a multiple choice test and ask me which one to use .
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I JUST WANT THE FREAKING LIGHTS TO TURN ON . </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really do like Windows 8 and love Windows 8.1 . I like Microsoft Products and will continue to purchase&nbsp;software from Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I simplify my experience when using Windows opening different file types and programs .?????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SkyDrive has been driving me crazy lately . Offline, Online ??? My/PC&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like I'm back in school .&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Downloading software has become a very risky task . I am tired of deleting programs that piggy back the software I am downloading.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I download a specific program and 10 more show up . I just cant win. I have actually started doing more stuff on my phone. It doesn't ask me as many</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>questions as my computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks Steve </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My question again was . Safest and best program or app to download to view a DVD using windows 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

                    I've talked with my service provider, Bell, and they fixed it from their end, and replaced the modem. But it still cuts out. Is this my computer? Low end, E Machine, 10 months old, not over used?

<p><span>Hey dmc613,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>√ò<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you streaming only from a particular website or from different websites?</span></p>
<p><span><span>√ò<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have a wireless or a wired connection?</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>√ò<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you streaming through any particular application?</span></p>
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>There
 are various factors interfering with online stream such as Internet traffic jams. Video is more susceptible than audio to such interruptions. To avoid this, you can buffer the streamed content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>There
 could be temporary problems between the server and the computer. Normally this resolves within a few minutes. If it doesn‚Äôt, try with another website.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Disable
 your antivirus/firewall. If you have installed security software that inspects outgoing network traffic on your computer, it may slow down your stream as it inspects it, causing the interruption. Try turning off any security software temporarily to isolate
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Create
 more resources to receive the file. Receiving the video requires that you have the proper amount of space needed to load the video temporarily. The video will be loaded in to your Web Cache. If this area is full, this can lead to slow loading. For help, see:&nbsp;<span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/View-temporary-Internet-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">View

<p><span><span>5.&nbsp; Update your router firmware.</span></span><span><span><span>Updated
 router firmware often can fix frequent internet disconnects. </span><span>Visit the router manufacturer‚Äôs support section and check if there‚Äôs any firmware update for
 your product.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>Yes, I am able to play them in <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> and <strong>

I do not have another computer to test at the moment. Maybe tomorrow. But it would required installing the appropriate codecs, which I do not want to do on someone else's computer.</p>

    <title>Blocking of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blocking of Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>Does Microsoft have the option to block installation of Windows on a targeted PC??</p>
<p>My laptop has Windows 10 pro. And recently I heard about Remix OS and tried installing it Dual boot with Windows.</p>
<p>Until then Windows ran perfectly... After installation of Remix OS,I tried booting into Windows but an Stop Code welcomed me "INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE"</p>
<p>I thought Remix OS was the reason behind it and formatted the whole HDD and tried installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>To my worst nightmare,the installation stuck at the language selection and from there nothing works.. Keyboard and mouse won't work at all.</p>
<p>And then I've tried installing Win 7 and Win 8.1 but my PC won't give in. It stops at the boot screen and restarts.</p>
<p>At present am using Linux mint 18. Only Linux based OS's were working. Other than Windows everything works.</p>
<p>I've lost all hope of Windows on it. If anyone thinks that they've the solution... you are always welcome.</p>
<p>Thanking you so much,</p>
<p>Windows Insider,</p>
<p>Tarun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>If you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process select 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC',
 and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Servers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise you will have to purchase a Windows 10 Licence</span></p>

            <p>Keyboard and mouse were working good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booted Linux OS in live boot and the keyboard and mouse were working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to my surprise Windows 7 is working on my PC.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

Many of you will be initiating a clean install instead of an in place upgrade. Before you do that though, you will need to ensure your data can move to the new version of Windows or that new device you will be buying. In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

            <p>Hello SwishierGnu5737, I would recommend clearing your mac address in settings- network settings. Also power cycling your console after that first step, by powering down the console fully for 5 minutes before unplugging power cord from wall and console and waiting 5-10 minutes before plugging all back in. Hope this helps, if these steps do not work you may need to reinstall the game.</p>

<p>Are you an Administrator or Standard user?</p>
<p>Right-click the game, select Run as administrator.</p>
<p>If Run as administrator is not working, then the game has been blocked by Parental Controls (if you're Standard user).</p>
