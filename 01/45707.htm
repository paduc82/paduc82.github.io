                    Windows is using my internet bandwidth to the fullest since two days, hence I am not able to use internet for other purposes. I have disabled Windows Update and Background Intelligent Transfer Service. Still the svchost.exe(netsvcs) can be observed in
 the resource monitor using most of the internet.&nbsp;<br />

I did not find any of the working solutions online. Windows 10 is getting worse day by day.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Svchost.exe is a process on your computer that hosts, or contains, other individual services that Windows uses to perform various functions. For example, Windows Defender uses a service that is hosted by a svchost.exe process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be multiple instances of svchost.exe running on your computer, with each instance containing different services. One instance of svchost.exe might host a single service for a program, and another instance might host several services related to
 Windows. You can use Task Manager to view which services are running under each instance of svchost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open <strong>Task Manager </strong>by pressing <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</strong>, then right-click an instance of
<strong>svchost.exe </strong>in <strong>Details</strong> tab, and then click <span>
<strong>Go to Service(s)</strong></span>. The services associated with the process are highlighted on the
<span>Services</span> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also suggest you to go for a complete system scan with Windows Defender or with any available Antivirus Software to make sure no virus is causing this issue. The

            <p>I have the exact same problem with <strong>hundreds </strong>of computers!</p>
<p>After Upgrading to 1607 from 1511 some of the clients are eating up all the network bandwith.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After investigating its always the same process "svchost.exe (netsvcs)"</p>
<p>Looking into the windows store i see handfull of apps trying to update but not ever finishing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thats it, this keeps on forever.</p>
<p>Have tried to let one computer run until it's finished.</p>
<p>After the machine transfered 100GB without doing anything i switched it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now i have rolled back all machines to 1511 because i don't know whats the problem causing this with 1607...</p>
<p>Also got the Problem with a 1607 fresh install. But not on all systems.... -___-</p>
<p>
</p><p>also i hear from many people that have this problem, but i can't find anything from microsoft about it.</p>

<p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

Wow - you get asked a follow-up question on this peer-to-peer forum (international) and you freak out like that?&nbsp; How's your normal everyday life treating you?&nbsp; This isn't *my* site - I am just a person, like you, giving freely of my time and getting yelled
 at by someone who obviously has issues outside of this forum they would like to take out on strangers...&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Not only that - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bde28a0d-e744-e011-9767-d8d385dcbb12">
you have gotten help on these forums before</a>, you know how this works.&nbsp; You start a conversation, someone may ask you follow-up questions since they, not surprisingly, aren't you and do not know what you are seeing, have done, have seen, can do and are willing
 to do - and you continue in a conversation like that until you reach a stopping point: hopefully a solution to your issue.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You could just answer the question, maybe you did not understand so I will expand:<br />
&nbsp; Did you have Stronghold Online Backup installed at some point and you uninstalled it?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If so...<br />
Find and delete "smessenger.exe" from your computer, reboot, re-run CCleaner.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In any case - take a deep breath and see if you can come up with a little patience when asking for assistance.<br />

<p>[quote user="Slim Krid"]hab nur letzte zeit viel dar√ºber gelesen das etliche videos gel√∂scht wurden wegen urheber rechts verletzung. aber ohne musik oder so sollte es wohl legal sein:)[/quote]</p>
<p>Dass die Videos gel√∂scht wurden, hatte meistens damit zusammengeh√§ngt, dass die Leute mit den Let's Play Videos und der eingeblendeten Werbung Geld verdient haben, was den Rechteinhabern der Spiele nicht gefallen hat.<br />
<br />
Da die Musik bei den meisten Spielen eigene Kompositionen sind, kannst Du auch die Musik anlassen. Bei Spielen mit lizensierter Musik (EA Trax bei Fifa beispielsweise) kann die automatische Erkennung bei GEMA Pflichtigen Liedern anspringen und das Video mit
 dem Lied in Deutschland sperren. </p>

<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some amount of memory is shared by virtual memory or available memory. The difference between available
 memory and physical memory can be explained like this</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Physical memory is how much RAM you have installed in your computer. For example, if you have two 512
 MB memory chips in your machine, you have a total of 1 GB of physical memory. This memory is what your computer uses to load the operating system as well as individual programs and files.<br />
<br />
Available memory refers to how much RAM is not already being used by the computer. Because loading the operating system takes up memory, your available memory drops right after your computer boots up. You can reduce how much memory the operating system uses
 by uninstalling system files or extensions that are often installed by utility programs.<br />
<br />
Each time you open a program, it is loaded into your computer's memory, and therefore reduces your available memory. Large programs such as Adobe Photoshop and 3D action games take up more memory than simple programs like text editors or spreadsheet programs.
 If you need more available memory to open a large program, you should first quit other programs that are running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For information related to computer memory:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the search box type in msinfo32</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open System information</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can even know from
</span><span>dxdiag (DirectX diagnostic Tool), type in diaxdiag in search box and select Yes, you receive the information related to the memory of the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 the update again and again trashed the connection to the Ubuntu server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog box says:</p>

</p><p>Please note Z: is the drive I assigned the server and \\server is the name of the server. &nbsp;I also tried to connect it using the numeric address but got the same dialog box.</p>

            <p>HI Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>have the same issue connecting to my QNAP NAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had verified that is related to KB318966 (so think typo in your org mail.) After uninstalling that patch my shares were working well again. After patch was installed again same issue again.
</p>
<p>Also updating another system showed the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I logon with an MS account and do not use PIN on that systems&nbsp; (PIN reset was mentioned in some earlier cases). I do not use guest access an that NAS box. Instead I have my MS account name created as user on the NAS.&nbsp; The user is normal user in Win10. If
 I use the NAS Name or IP address in FileExplorer address bar I get directly the error you was refering, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried with my local user (admininstrator Group member). And this user is able to browser the server for shares. So with Name or IP I get a list of all my Shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But adding my MS account&nbsp; user into admin Group did not solve it so far. </p>
<p>The only difference I can think about is :&nbsp;&nbsp; my Standard user use frequently the NAS. So I have some Folders as quicklinks in Explorer that I use.</p>
<p>My admin user don't go to NAS typicaly so no quicklink and no credentials are matching to user accounts on NAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW.&nbsp; my NAS is sitting in a DMZ so that could also something I have to look into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please can you share a little bit more of your configuration details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx&nbsp; and greetings from Germany</p>

<h2>            How do I get my bluetooth headset enabled on my pc &#40;windows7 os&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I have followed the instructions given in the pc's 'help': Once the dongle was plugged in I clicked on 'control panel' and entered 'bluetooth' in the search bar, but 'bluetooth settings' is missing from the screen that appears so I can't check if the software
 is microsoft friendly. I have also tried installing the software that came with the headset and there is no option to pair the headset with the bluetooth dongle to be found either in control panel or anywhere else I have thought to look. Am I missing something
 obvious, or is it the case that this headset (Suicen SX-905F) is never going to work with my pc? Would appreciate your help.</div>

    <title>Device driver not installed for unknown device. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> table100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device driver not installed for unknown device.</h2>
                    After upgrading my various computers to Windows 7 Home Premium, I am now getting the small yellow triangle icon on the computer icon in the devices and printer screen.<br />
<br />
After running the troubleshooter from the context menu the result indicates there is no device driver for an unknown device. Also in device manager under other devices there is an unknown device with no driver.<br />
<br />
How can I resolve this issue when I don't know what the device is?

<p><span>Hi table100,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What‚Äôs the make and model number of the computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried right-clicking the
<strong>Unknown Device </strong>and<strong> </strong>selecting <strong>
Update Driver Software? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>What happens when you try the above steps?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the device gets detected as
<strong>Unknown, </strong>let‚Äôs check for the status of the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the
<strong>Unknown Device </strong>in Device Manager and select <strong>
Properties.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Under
<strong>General </strong>tab, check for the status of the <strong>
Unknown Device </strong>under <strong>Device status. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Does it show any error message/code associated with the
<strong>Unknown Device</strong>? If yes, let us know the exact error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let‚Äôs also check for the Hardware Ids and see if that throws some light on the
</span><strong><span>Unknown Device.</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Right-click the
<strong>Unknown Device </strong>in Device Manager and select <strong>
Properties. </strong>Click the <strong>Details</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>Under
<strong>Property, </strong>select <strong>Hardware Ids</strong> from the<strong>
</strong>drop-down menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What are the values that appear in the
<strong>Value </strong>box?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let us know the details and we shall proceed with the troubleshooting accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi table100,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The recommended resolution</span><span> for Code 28 is to update the driver, which you
 have already done with no results. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also, since the Hardware Id is not displayed in the Device Manager, let‚Äôs uninstall
<span>the unknown device from Devices Manager, restart the computer and check if that fixes the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click <strong>
Start, </strong>type<strong> Device Manager </strong>and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Locate the <strong>
Unknown Device.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Right-click the
<strong>Unknown Device </strong>and<strong> </strong>select <strong>Uninstall. </strong>
</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the on-screen instructions. Restart the computer and check what happens.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this helps!<br />

<p>It could be a configuration on your modem/router, you can try to hard reset it, most routers have a small button to reset, push and hold for about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Hello Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Is this issue occurring on an Xbox One or Xbox 360? We have two articles that can be used to resolve this issue. The first article is entitled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I Get an Error Message When I Run the 'Test Network Connection' on Xbox One</a>. The other article is entitled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I need Help With My Xbox 360 Network Connection</a>. Choose the correct article depending on which console is having the issue. The MAC address filter is a feature on routers and gateways in which any device's MAC address is added to the filter list in order
 to allow the device to connect to the network. The Xbox&nbsp;One network article we linked has that&nbsp;process in it. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

<h2>            Keyboard, and number pad problems.</h2>
                    I am having a problem... while using my keyboard, if I press delete button= a windowpus up labeled "windows help and support" ALSO while using the number pad if I hit 1=s1, 4=4 and cap lock, 7=w7, num lock=x and num lock. These are the only keys affected
 and I am Windows 7, but his happens anytime I use those keys. Is there a way to fix this problem?

            Hi advert1 , to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Are you freaking serious man?</p>
<p>It will literally take 1.5-2 hours for a flight to hit Houston from Memphis.&nbsp; UPS will have all of their Thursday pick ups loaded into their system by 9 tonight, the flight will leave Memphis at around midnight, and your xbox will be loaded up on a delivery
 truck at about 6 am tomorrow and you'll have it by noon. &nbsp;Why is everyone freaking out? &nbsp;Do most of you guys not know how logistics work with carriers like Fed Ex and UPS. &nbsp;They have this stuff down to a science.</p>

<p>All my stuff is sitting in CA. &nbsp;since the 19th. &nbsp;I'm in WA. &nbsp;but all of the packages are "Air Saver" means Next day by end of day. &nbsp;I'm sure they will be moving lots this afternoon and through the night. &nbsp; I'm amazed they didn't move them closer to destination
 and then hold for delivery. &nbsp;Maybe UPS / MS didn't trust anyone outside of the primary Hub locations and choose to hold at the key points till today. &nbsp;/shrug &nbsp;I'll get concerned tomorrow @ 7pm if I don't have it in hand yet.

<p>The only question i have is do you have to sign for the package? My wife and I are going to see an off Broadway show tomorrow night and i won't be home if the package is delivered after 5 o'clock (my UPS guy usually delivers by 7 o'clock for non next day
 air shipments). &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the package isn't left at my doorstep, then i won't be able to get it until Monday, which will *** me off greatly.</p>

<h3> chrissosik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open .Exe files in windows 8</h2>
                    I have just recently built a computer with a fresh install of Windows 8 Pro about a week ago. I have been having trouble running any file that I download. From games on steam to Norton's uninstaller tool. Here is what happens in order when I try to open
 a .Exe file.&nbsp;
<div>1) I download the setup files in this case it would be Norton's Removal Tool (You can find it on their site)&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) I run the set up. Windows asks me if I want to run the setup file and I select "Yes".&nbsp;</div>
<div>3) Nothing happens. I have waited up to hours and yet, nothing happens.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have tried looking in the registry at the values of my .Exe files and everything is okay it says: "%1"%"</div>
<div>Do I have a virus? No it doesn't seem that way. I have downloaded files from trusted sources only like Apple, Steam, Ect.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any hints or answers as to what I could do here?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyone having the same problem? Please Leave Feedback!&nbsp;</div>

            This might be another issue than what the original poster described. Try uninstalling java, then re-installing it. I had an issue with minecraft that was fixed this way. Also, check the RAM/processor usage of minecraft when opened (in task manager).<br />

            the problems just keep racking up "corrupted" seems to be a patent to get uot of responsibility for your product. That's right we pay REAL (&amp;**G&amp;(^(*H MONEY for this **** and it doesn't work getting a premium plan from Microsoft doesn't work either you
 spend as much time on the phone proving you bought a plan then they use programs to "fix" your computer using free versions or previews in you computer. I am so tired of this stupid BS from Microsoft I used to revere them but I have lost all respect for them
 the operating system sucks totally and their response is no better yeah I paid real money for this frustration thanks micro morons

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the BIOS settings for hard disk operation.
</span></p>
<p><span>I would also Suggest you to load the optimize default from BIOS and then check.</span></p>
<p><span>To get into the BIOS I would suggest you to refer the computer manual</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform this steps only if you are comfortable with BIOS.</span></p>
<p><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can causeserious problems
 that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> You may run chkdsk from WINRE.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to troubleshoot this issue will run chkdsk from WinRE(Windows Recovery Environment )mode and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Chkdsk (Chkdsk.exe)</span></b><span> is a command-line tool that checks volumes for problems. It runs automatically
 only if you have any problems. The tool then tries to repair any that it finds. For example, Chkdsk can repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run check disk, you have to have Windows Vista DVD, boot the computer to Win RE from the elevated command prompt, and try to do a CHKDSK. You can follow these steps
 to run CHKDSK :</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the Windows 7 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE).</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Command Prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><b><span>chkdsk drive: /p
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>chkdsk drive: /r</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Chkdsk disclaimer</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the
 hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer.</p>

    <title>how to make font size larger in file explorer... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haolekook  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to make font size larger in file explorer...</h2>
                    <p>So... Here I am again. Does anyone know if there is a way to make the font size larger in windows 10 FILE EXPLORER?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the "advanced display setting" change. I am talking specifically about FILE EXPLORER. Changing the font size of text in title bars, menus, etc. has no effect on FILE EXPLORER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text or font size in left and right panes are too small. I need the font size to be bigger. Is that possible? If not from windows or file explorer settings, then maybe an add-on? And if windows does not provide the functionality to change font size,
 does anyone know of an alternative app that does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the "large icon" setting. I am talking specifically about the font size, not the icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
