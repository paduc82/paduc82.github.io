<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code 45 indicates the a device is disconnected from your computer. The error code would be automatically resolved if you connect the associated device to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may run the Hardware troubleshooter in Windows 10 to let Windows find and fix problems with the devices in your PC. Running the troubleshooter would tell us if the issue is caused by software conflicts within your device. Here's how to run the
 troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, and select it from the search results.</li><li>Click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>run the troubleshooter.</li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>to start the troubleshooting.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance feel free to ask us.</p>

            The same error code still appears in Device Manager. I've tried disabling it and re enabling it but that didn't make any difference. Before the Remote NDIS internet sharing device was working perfectly. I wanted to reset my computer and reinstall windows
 and now the&nbsp;Remote NDIS internet sharing device isn't detected anymore. I have never touched or move any connections and i'm not sure where to find this&nbsp;Remote NDIS internet sharing device connection.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many possible reasons why you're getting this issue such as an incorrectly configured driver, corruption in the Windows registry, and malware infection relating to Windows system files. To further resolve the issue about the code 45 error, we suggest
 that you repair the registry entries associated with the error code. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button.</li><li>Type <strong>command </strong>in the search box.</li><li>While holding the <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>keys, hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>You will be prompted with a permission dialog box.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>A black box will open with a blinking cursor.</li><li>Type <strong>regedit </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>In the Registry Editor, select the Error 45-related key (eg. Windows Operating System) you want to back up.</li><li>From the <strong>File </strong>menu, choose <strong>Export</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Save In</strong> list, select the folder where you want to save the Windows Operating System backup key.</li><li>In the <strong>File Name</strong> box, type a name for your backup file, such as "Windows Operating System Backup".</li><li>In the <strong>Export Range</strong> box, be sure that "<strong>Selected branch</strong>" is selected.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li><li>The file is then saved with a<strong> .reg file extension</strong>.</li><li>You now have a backup of your Code 45-related registry entry.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:&nbsp;</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Let us know if the recommended solution works for you. </p>

            Wait, so backing up my registry is also repairing it? If so, it doesn't seem as if anything has changed, it still doesn't work.

    <title>Remove me from a family account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darth pryde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove me from a family account.</h2>
                    
<p>Three years ago me and a friend bought a family plan so that we would have to extra gold accounts that we could give to his little sisters. He has security paranoia problems and didn't want me to have full access to everything on the account. I didn't care
 back then because he payed the majority of it and I didn't have trust issues. The only thing I did have was full adult use which meant no parental permissions needed. I know there has been at least one&nbsp;<strong>Terms of Use</strong> change since I have been
 in this "Family" and I didn't have a problem accepting it, but now for some reason I need his password to accept the terms of use. The real kicker is that he has forgotten his password and he doesn't have enough information to recover it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing that I really don't understand is that I can't be removed from this account without his permission. I really don't understand why not. Even if he was my parent and I was underage when I was added to the account I am know 21 years old and I don't
 need parental permission for anything. I just want to be removed from the family account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting sick and tired of having to jump through loops to get anything to work the way it is supposed to work. I payed for the games I play and the system I use. I have payed for X-Box Live Gold and if I had a steady income I would always be paying
 for it. Even though Microsoft has deleted 3000G off of my account and then told me they would "review" it in two days, and then "misplaced" my information, which I found out a week later when I called them and asked whats up. They told me two more days to
 actually do the review. I ended up calling another week later and got put on hold for an hour while someone checked something and ended up calling on a second phone to get a hold of someone else. I talked to this person for an hour and a half all the while
 waiting to see if the other person would pick up the phone so I could get there name. They never did and I hung up on them after another hour. I ended up talking to someone "above" the normal customer support, who I doubt was actually any good at his job,
 because he told me there was nothing they could do, and the only way I could get a straight answer or any sort of compensation for one of Microsoft's many screw ups was to complain on the forums.</p>
<p>Now that I have literally been pushed to the point of quivering with rage, doing my best not to explode on someone just trying to do there job, for the third time here I am trying to just get one problem solved and maybe, just maybe get something to make
 up for the weeks of time Microsoft has wasted of my life. At least, please, please help me get off of this family account. Preferably in a manor that does not take "8 to 12 weeks to review".</p>

<p>I can't get online at all; even using x-box.com. I am always prompted to accept the "terms of use", but I can't because of the Family Plan. &nbsp;It seems to be a circle of "hey, screw you consumer". &nbsp;I am sorry, but I am very, very irritated. Is there anyway

<p>Hey there, Darth Pryde. Really sorry to hear about your situation. This definitely sounds frustrating and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately you will need your friend to sign in so you can accept the terms. If he doesn't remember the password
 he can reset it from here: <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a>. Has he tried to reset it on that page already? Let us know!</p>

<p>He has tried it. Several time actually. I'll talk to him about it again, but he has a communication problem. I do not know if he got a reply. I assumed that he didn't considering that he still can't sign into his account. I will ask if he got any kind of
 reply, but if this is the same thing that the customer support person told me. I have to be honest. If I have to wait a few weeks to fix a problem that is both my friends and Microsoft's fault. I will flip s***.
</p>
<p>First, I will work with you, and I will talk to my friend, and I will get you the code, if there is one. I don't know if you have ever been so angry that you are literally shaking because you have no where to point your anger, but I do, and both times it
 was because of Microsoft. This very reason being one of the causes. </p>

<p>This is what I don't get... Why can't Microsoft be more flexible, there should really just be an option to remove yourself from these things without needing to accept the ToS, it's clear that a lot of people are having issues with this, yet they chose to
 not do anything about this and force customers to jump through hoops and many of them (including me) are just being led around in a circle due to this stubborn business practice.

<p>Hey there Darth! As mentioned above, the only way to "fix" this issue is to have the parent account accept the Terms of Use. If that account cannot be accessed, and you have already tried all the troubleshooting, please have him contact support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>)
 to see if they can assist. We here on the forum unfortunately cannot assist with this type of issue. Thanks.

            <p>The Base Filtering Engine (BFE) is a service that manages firewall and Internet Protocol security (IPsec) policies and implements user mode filtering. Stopping or disabling the BFE service will significantly reduce the security of the system. It will also
 result in unpredictable behavior in IPsec management and firewall applications.</p>
<p>Windows Firewall depends on BFE to work correctly.</p>
<p>To know if BFE is running in your system, click Start, and type this command:</p>
<p>cmd /k sc qc bfe</p>
<p>Press {ENTER}</p>
<p>If you receive the following error:</p>
<p>[SC] OpenService FAILED 1060:</p>
<p>The specified service does not exist as an installed service.</p>
<p><br />
This is usually the handiwork of one or more Malware. See this URL for explanation and information on how to restore the missing service:</p>

            If the connector is broken on the motherboard side, it may be almost impossible to repair. &nbsp;If it is the connector itself, you may be able to 'scratch build' one from another connector in some broken electronic you may have around.

<p>A quicker method is to simply test your connection. For some reason there's a delay between buying on the website and your console getting that information.</p>

    <title>SDD and a HDD windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saturn7110x  say:</h3>
<h2>            SDD and a HDD windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 installed on a 525gb SDD. I have a 1tb HDD that I'm using for my data. I've been reading a lot of conflicting tweaks to use on the SDD. Help!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Should I eliminate the swap on the SDD? I do a have a windows managed swap file on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Should I turn off indexing on the SDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Should I turn off system restore on the SDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the articles I've been reading have been a couple of years old. I know that the current SDDs are better but do these same tweaks apply now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info and suggestions are appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>You've been reading very old advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to leave the swap file alone and at system managed size.</p>
<p>Leave indexing on.</p>
<p>In Windows 10, System Restore is off by default. You can turn it on if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no need to 'tweak' a SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the ways you can tell the difference between someone who doesn't really understand technology (that used to be me, unfortunately) and someone who does is that the former is incessantly tweaking and optimizing their computer.</p>

<p>Hi Mikael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>High CPU usage after updating to Fall Creators Update can be caused by incompatible components conflicting with your installed programs. As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you perform
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a>. This will start your computer with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs which can help us determine whether an installed program or an update is causing the issue. Follow the steps on Windows 10 from the link that we have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done with the troubleshooting steps, make sure to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/#reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</a>. Check if the issue is still the same, if so, we can go back to your previous build and perform a repair upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us for any updates so we can proceed with the next steps.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 on Windows 10</h2>
                    I want to upgrade to Windows 10 but I'm not sure if my Microsoft Office 2010 package will still work on Windows 10. I'm currently on Windows 7 Home Premium. So will I have to buy Microsoft Office again if I upgrade to Windows 10 or will my current Office
 2010 package carry over? (Sorry if this seems like a silly question.)

            I recently up graded to 10 and my office&nbsp; 2010 would not work. Windows 10 seems to uninstall office and then you need to reactivate it. If your key does not allow you to uninstall and activate on a new machine you may be out of luck. I went back to win
 7 and had my office back and registered.&nbsp; I'm not sure what win 10 does to the program but it seems to update it and change something about the registration. Microsoft told me the key was activated it's maximum number of times so I would have to buy a new
 office to use on windows 10, although it works fine and is registered to me on windows 7. I think Microsoft needs to do something about this but they have told me the only solution is to buy Office 2013 if I want to have office with windows 10.

            <p>Well I have never heard of an Office 2010 license that is really tied to how many times you activate it.&nbsp; Yes there is a counter to try to prevent pirating, but the actual licensing is about how many machines you are using it on.&nbsp; For instance my license
 is for 3 machines.&nbsp; I have rebuilt and replaced many machines over the years.&nbsp; If Office 2010 doesn't activate automatically, a call to Microsoft fixes it by telling them the old machine is dead (or I replaced the motherboard, ...) and they activate it for
 me.<br />
</p>
<p>Now I have heard of and OEM copy, which is one that the manufacture puts on your machine.&nbsp; That might be tied to only that device.&nbsp; And in this case I wouldn't know if changing the operating system is considered changing the device.&nbsp; But again if that is
 true it isn't based on how many times you activate, but on if the license it tied to a certain device/operating system.</p>

            The key I have is a volume license key from a few years ago and it gets blocked by Microsoft when it has been activated it's total number of times. When windows 10 installs it checks the key and if it has reached it's number of installs it will not let
 you activate it for windows 10. If you go back to windows 7 you can still activate it as it does not see it as a new install. That is the reply from both the Microsoft help desk and the "up and running" help desk. Both of them told me my only option was to
 purchase new. They both agreed the key, when purchased, was legitimate and was registered as office 2010 professional.

            <p>I had forgot about the volume license, but in fact it proves my point.&nbsp; It isn't the number installs they are blocking, it is the number of "machines/devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same "machine/device" they would let you reinstall all you want.&nbsp; But they consider it a different machine/device when you updated to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>That appears to be true from the Microsoft perspective. I still have the same machine, serial number, processor etc. Every other piece of software works fine with the change.&nbsp; Only Microsoft is treats this as a new install and only Microsoft is pushing me
 to pursue my options like "Open Office" or "Libre Office" as I am not prepared to upgrade to win 10 and purchase a new office.

<h2>            Surface Book automatic system update</h2>
                    My surface book just had its 1st automatic system update. The update completed successfully after a few minutes. However, the laptop then went into a restarting loop continuously. I shut it down and started it up again after a few minutes. It restarted
 over and over again. Each time after restart, it looks as if it is working normally. But after I logged in, the surface book restarted automatically. The same pattern repeats over and over again. Can you suggest what should I do next? &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Lost my Windows 10 Product Key, is it possible to extract it from &#47;windows folder or something similar&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have potentially lost my Windows activation key/digital license by attempting to fully Reset Windows 10 and then encountering an error `INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE`.<br />
<br />
On a brand new computer, after minimal use, Windows Defender detected a virus so I decided that I would fully reset(delete all of the files) the computer to make sure virus is fully deleted, but in doing so I encountered an endless loop of Blue Screen of Death
 with&nbsp;</span></span><span>`INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE`, with no way of even attempting to turn of safe mode or anything else, as I could only access BIOS or have Windows 10 attempt to start, and end up with the BSoD and then auto-restart, in an endless loop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But I haven't saved my Windows 10 Product Key in any way, and it was used on the computer that is now broken. I still have the hard drive of the computer, so my only hope is to somehow get the Product Key/Digital License from the files&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5979b15b-e46b-461a-9e2d-73a7798fd63b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5979b15b-e46b-461a-9e2d-73a7798fd63b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I want to extract the Product Key is because I cannot figure out how to circumvent the `INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE` error, so I decided that I would simply reinstall Windows 10, but that would require reactivating Windows 10 in the new installation.</p>

            Hi Zobody, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10.

<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files

<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

<p>So how far away are you from the router it may just be down to distance? And you don't have any obviously wireless devices in your path like cordless phones or wireless hi-fi's or anything?</p>
<p>Are all of your other wireless clients using Wireless N adapters? If so (stab in the dark) you could try selecting the "Green Field" option in the SMC's advanced wireless section.</p>

<p>I mean do you have any other devices (PC's , iphones etc) using wireless, if so do they use wireless N or wireless G? If all of your devices use Wireless N you can give the Green Field option a go in your advanced wireless section menu on the router, it
 should be there somewhere its in the manual</p>

    <title>Win7 boots to blank blue screen w&#47; cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choldgraf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 boots to blank blue screen w&#47; cursor</h2>
                    <div>When I boot into windows, it hangs for a very long time during "Preparing your desktop", then boots up with a blank blue screen with a mouse cursor. &nbsp;Ctr-Alt-Del brings up the options screen as usual, but if I click anything then nothing happens and it
 returns to the blue screen. (not the BSOD, by the way, just a blue background). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing this is a result of my recent switch to a new hard drive. &nbsp;To that extent, here is the process I went through:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I switched my operating systems from an old hard drive to a new SSD that I bought. &nbsp;My setup was a dual-boot Windows 7/ Ubuntu linux, using Grub as a boot manager. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The way that I switched to the new drive was by using GParted to copy the windows partition to the SSD. &nbsp;I then used a Windows Repair disc to make it bootable. &nbsp;The OS on the new drive was working great, so I decided to delete the old partition on the
 old drive. &nbsp;When I did this, everything went completely haywire.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure why this would happen, since Windows said it was running from the SSD. &nbsp;I tried running the bootrec tool, but to no avail. &nbsp;When I use bcdedit it finds the bootloader for the partition, and gives the path to the windows folder that is on the
 SSD. &nbsp;I also tried running CHKDSK and it found no errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>When I browse the SSD with the command line, it seems to be a full windows installation.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've heard that this could be fixed with an installation disc, but mine is currently at my home across the country, so it'd be nice to fix this without having to ship it over. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm at a loss for new things to attempt right now. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas? &nbsp;</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Either there was an utimely hardware issue or something in the .old folder was being accessed
<br />
to run Windows and so&nbsp;when removed&nbsp;the issues started (of course that would also be unusual).<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need to re-install Windows 7 so check with your System Maker as they should be<br />
able to provide either an ISO to download and install or the installation media. Be sure to work out<br />
with them the Product Key needed to activate Windows.<br />
<br />
Check with the Support for GParted and the version of GRUB used as you probably are not the<br />
only one that has had this issue.<br />
<br />
====================================================================<br />
<br />
You mentioned some of these however just to be sure it would be best to repeat these.<br />
<br />
Run StartUp Repair at least TWICE then use the below.<br />

    <title>Lenovo T440p plugged in, not charging, no message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordonjo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo T440p plugged in, not charging, no message</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo T440p , running Windows 10. Recently, while plugged into the charger, the battery stopped charging. There is no message displayed, this is not the "plugged in not charging case". The only thing that happens is that the led indicator blinks
 4 times instead of 3. I tried rebooting the machine with the battery removed, uninstalled the battery driver, started up again with the battery back in. Still not charging. I purchased a new battery, same thing with the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would greatly appreciate any help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solved on my side!</p>
<p>The issue was the current power plan in Windows 10. It seems that the battery cannot charge when the power plan is set to "Airplane". Switching back to a regular power plan fixes the issue and allows the battery to charge.</p>

<h2>            HP Pavilion g7 won&#39;t connect to any other WiFi except for the one in my home</h2>
                    My wireless adapter will only connect to my wireless router at home and no other WiFi connections. It won't even let me add another network or set up a new connection. The adapter is able to see the other wireless connections and even give me the option
 to choose them, but when I click "connect" or double click that wireless connection, it doesn't do anything at all, not even prompt me for a password if&nbsp;necessary.

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">This problem occurs when a wireless network profile with the same identifier or network name (SSID) as the network you want to connect already
 exists. For example, you visit an office with a wireless network called WiFi and with the key 123456789; later you visit a second office with a wireless network called WiFI but with a different key, let's say 987654321. Therefore, the computer won't be able
 to connect to the second office.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Windows 7 works in a way in which it tries to use the saved network settings for the detected network based on the name. When the settings do
 not match, it will show the error message even if you are aware of the network changes and it won't prompt you for the new settings.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">In order to solve this problem, follow these steps:</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            Files no longer in my desktop</h2>
                    <p><span>It started today. There weren't any updates but after turning on my computer, everything except my software shortcuts are gone and my background was I think windows 10 default. Music files, picture files and work files etc... weren't on the desktop
 screen. However, I did found it but it was located in&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\Users\HP\Desktop</strong><span>, where I originally stored all my files before this incident even happen. I'm guessing this where my original desktop is located even before this incident.
 Anyway I cut all the files and pasted it on the current desktop at the time. Not only that but it seems like I had put in my username and password again for every software and my emails as well.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After a while I restarted my computer and now I am stuck with my original desktop and my background was back but not a single file was there not even in&nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\HP\Desktop</strong>. I have no clue where the previous desktop was located and
 I really want my files back from it. Also, what type of problem is this? Has it something to do with the network or my hard drive? Any way I would really be thankful if anyone can help me get my files back.</span></p>

</span></a>that might optionally need to take pictures or know what country you're in as some services might have restrictions or optimizations by&nbsp;location for services they can provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File explorer is one program that uses this app. Disabling it may mean a poor experience using these types of services as the app seems to be related to background file transfers and prefetching.

<p>The app has the following capabilities:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&lt;Capability Name="internetClient" /&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&lt;uap:Capability Name="picturesLibrary" /&gt;</p>

</p><p><strong>2) Windows Shell Experience </strong></p>
The Windows Shell Experience Host is a windows app located in C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_* that deals with the windows user experience like the start menu, action center, jump view UI, quick connect UI, notifications, and animated clock and battery
 displays.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app uses Windows.UI.Xaml.Automation automation including the OpenContactButton, OpenContact,&nbsp; and ContactLookupProgressBar. This app looks like it&nbsp;deals with the display of opening a contact on
 your device and view details of the contact. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's also a settings page that can allow you to share Wi-Fi (</p>

<p>&nbsp;with one group of contacts. There's an&nbsp;option in the current Manage Wi-Fi settings for Outlook, Skype, and Facebook contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is probably a way to view who in your contacts is currently using your Wi-Fi connection. I haven't tried out the Wi-Fi sharing capabilities yet so this is a little fuzzy to me. I wouldn't disable
 this as it will make your desktop experience worse unless you have an alternative.</p>
