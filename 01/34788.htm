            <p>I haven't received any ideas on how to deal with the problem of locked files in Windows 10 other than the OneDrive bug.&nbsp; Is there nothing that can be done short of reverting to a previous version of Windows?&nbsp; Understand you can only revert back for 30 days
 so that doesn't help either.&nbsp; Getting very frustrated with something that should be fixed by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I've tried everything and still cannot save to my folders. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried making new directories, folders and sub-folders to eliminate the Read only function and wasn't<br />
successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Right clicking the folder; select Properties and the attribute is <strong>
Read Only with the box solid black </strong>(not a check mark)&nbsp;and keeps popping up after being removed&nbsp; when you apply.&nbsp; Changes couldn't be made because it said I have to have administrator permission so I added Administrator to my sign-up and log in as Administrator.
 Even then it won't let me change attributes.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've used the attrib -r +s drive\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt; and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I can't save pictures, documents or music because they are all read only.
<br />
<br />
Anyone really know how to correct this problem? </p>

            <p>Does anyone have a fix to this issue on file attriutes with pictures? &nbsp;I have several thousand pics on my laptop and can't do much with them because of this attriute problem. &nbsp;I now have to put files on a thumb drive, and copy them to an old desktop running
 an old version of Windows to allow me to work with my pictures. &nbsp;Do I have to buy an Apple product so I can again edit my pictures??? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Win10 Losing Functions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimridgeway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Losing Functions</h2>
                    <p>The upgrade from 7Pro to W10 went OK...except after a few sessions I had to re-configure permissions in order to use Outlook. &nbsp;Then a few days later, after a update initiated by Microsoft, some taskbar features stopped working (Search, Store, Notifications,
 etc) and Calculator disappeared. Today, when I tried to start Edge from the taskbar icon it disappeared. &nbsp;Thankfully, Chrome has survived...so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Little by little the standard features of the operating system seem to be removing themselves. &nbsp;I've started a fresh thread even though there seems to be other people with similar problems. &nbsp;My difference is that the problem seems to be progressive...the
 features seem to be unravelling over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>

            <p>I ran Step 1 previously...no problems were identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I was signed in to my Microsoft account, Step 2 didn't complete and the message was that I needed a Microsoft account (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3 contained instructions for w8 which I could not follow. &nbsp;My problems began after a few sessions using w10...as described in my initial comments. &nbsp;None of the aps that have disappeared were installed by me. &nbsp;They (Calculator, Store, Edge, etc) were
 all part of the w10 conversion. &nbsp;I've never used Store...and CAN'T since it has disappeared from the Taskbar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't follow the directions for Step 3 because I can't access the Start commands like Search. Left click on Start gives a critical error stating that Start is not working (Really?) &nbsp;Right click on start reveals the Search option, but Search is dead.</p>

 as little as possible on the DC). Also, is that part of Application Server Role?&nbsp; I find it strange that a service that is now being enforced by Microsoft seems to have so little documentation online....</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                    I updated to Windows 10, then found that my driver doesn't have any updates. I was having problems with it after going to windows 10. So, I decided to go back to Windows 8.1. Now it will again do an automatic update to install Windows 10 again! &nbsp;How do
 I turn this off?

            <p><span><span>What follows may help if you do not wish to upgrade to Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A lot of problems arise from setting Windows Update to automatically update. You may prefer to change this setting. Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X</strong>, Control Panel</span><span>, </span>
<span>Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to ‚Äú<strong>Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and
 install them</strong>‚Äù and click on OK. Restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X</strong>, Control Panel</span><span>, Windows Update,
<strong>Check for Updates</strong>. If optional updates are available click optional updates and make sure that the box before
<strong>Upgrade to Windows 10</strong> is unchecked. Right click on <strong>Upgrade to Windows 10</strong> and select
<strong>Hide this Update</strong>. Check the boxes before the remaining updates. Click on
<strong>Install</strong> and click again on <strong>Install</strong> in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress
 window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient. Restart the computer when prompted to do so.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may find that
<strong>Upgrade to Windows 10</strong> does not stay hidden. If that happens repeat the exercise as necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right click on the Start button and select Properties, Taskbar tab. Click Customise (under Notification area). In the next window place the cursor on GWX<span>&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am encountering the same issue.</p>
<p>However, if I access directly to the memory card of the camera (through a card reader), I am able to access the photos from Windows. That's really the USB access to the D300 which is faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Nikon support regarding this issue: their feedback is that this is a Windows 10 problem and that Microsoft teams are currently working on the issue.</p>
<p>@Arun B J, can you double-check on Microsoft side?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <blockquote> 
 <p>there is always a cost to it.</p><p>You don't get a free one unless you create a new account</p> 
  <p>I created the account long time ago and I have never changed the Gamertag, so from the XBox App in Windows I was trying&nbsp;to change it, but i&nbsp;cancel it because I&nbsp;did not know what Gametarg to&nbsp;put. Now I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;change the Gametarg again&nbsp;from the xbox app in Windows and the app tells me that i have to pay. The reason is&nbsp; that i haven't change my gamertag for free yet.</p><p> 
 </p></blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><p>You have though. You only get a free gametag change when you first create the account and are given a random gamertag.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>MiGu3l1991Col is not a randomly generated gamertag and would have had to have been chosen.</p><p><br /></p><p>Random gamertags are in the format of an adjective+animal name+number. For example SillyFawn123 would be a randomly generated gamertag.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You would have had to have chosen&nbsp;</p><p>MiGu3l1991Col as your gamertag to have that. Hense that would have been your 1 free gamertag change. Any others would have to be paid for.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t stop updating</h2>
                    <p>I can't make the updating stop.&nbsp; I don't even get the option not to update or update later.&nbsp; It just posts a notification in like a golden yellow box that says updating will begin at...and it give a time usually about 15 minutes away...and to shut down all
 programs.&nbsp; And sure enough, 15 minutes later it goes into that yellow or golden screen and starts configuring and updating which is about 3 or more hours worth of updating.&nbsp; When it's over and I log back into my programs, after a short while I get the same
 notification and it goes right back into the update again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This weekend I got no more than 2 hours of usage of my computer.&nbsp; The entire weekend, 24/7 this windows 10 was updating around the clock.&nbsp; It says don't turn off your computer so I left it on all night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I checked out the troubleshooter and it said that it fixed some problems.&nbsp; I thought that might be the answer.&nbsp; Nope, it sent me another notification today, Monday, and I shut down and restarted my computer so it wouldn't go into the update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how I can make this updating stop?&nbsp; I'm not computer savvy.&nbsp; I'm just an old woman using a desktop computer for facebook, email and facebook games.&nbsp; And I can't seem to be able to do much of anything before my computer is consumed with these
 updates and all I can do is wait endlessly for the updates to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp; I can't pay $99 for help over the phone.&nbsp; I have no money for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I can find my way back here again.&nbsp; So, please email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with how to make this stop.&nbsp; Thank you so much.</p>

            <p><em>Assuming the UPDATE section replaces everything below the dotted line...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>MBAM tells us that v3.x - even the 14-day free-trial -&nbsp;should be fully-compatible with Windows Defender. That being said, others have found they needed to remove it before Defender would start working, too. 99.99% of them found that MBAM, et alia, detected
 &amp; removed/quarantined "bad guys" so YMMV as to the cause of the incompatibility. [Both work in tandem here.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could keep AdwCleaner but you'd prolly need to download a new version if you wanted/needed to run it later, so may was well get rid of it. AdwCleaner&nbsp;doesn't "install" (technically speaking) so you can't "uninstall" it&nbsp; - just delete the stuff you downloaded,
 wherever you'd saved it.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>e.g., If I were removing AdwCleaner, I'd just delete <strong>C:\</strong><em><strong>AdwCleaner
</strong>&lt;=this folder</em></li></ul>
<em>
</em><p><em>
</em>
</p><p>If you installed (literally) HitmanPro, you'd uninstall it via <strong>Programs and Features | Remove a program</strong>. If, however, you just&nbsp;saved the download to, e.g., your desk or a flash drive &amp; ran it from there, you'd just Delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Type carefully. Inadvertently hitting that "volume control" key/keyboard combination&nbsp;may be responsible for the Notification Area icon's disappearance!
<em>I hate when that happens...</em> &lt;wink&gt;</p>

<h2>            XP Pro desktop stored 6yrs Now purchased Win 10 &#43; Home &#38; Key &#43;ISO on FlashDrive &#38; Need advice&#47;help to install</h2>
                    <p>I left my Dell Win XP Pro Desktop PC at my daughter's several years ago &amp; it was placed in storage til recently, so it went years without updates .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were a few updates I was able to do to get it running after all this time but as XP is no longer supported, I purchased a Win 10 Home activation key &amp; ISO file which I put onto a flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleaned the PC files out, removed old files and had to updated some drivers and ran scans but now I am stuck&nbsp; as to how to start the install it as I put the flash drive in but in order to boot from it I have to hit the F12 but upon restart my keyboard
 doesnt begin to function til its already loaded as XP so I havent found a way to work around it to reach the BIOS&nbsp; so I can alternate the boot and get the flash drive to load the new win 10</p>
<p>.<br />
Is there any other way to get the flash drive with the win 10 file to open and run?</p>

<p>Hi Shehan,<br />
Del Optiplex Gx270<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks - I had tried both F2 and F12 when I realized my keyboard doesnt engage until after windows gets started, sort of delay reaction so before I could get to the boot its opening up in XP &nbsp;agan. I didnt realize that I cant even get into F8 safe mode.</p>
<p>I did find some updates for XP on microsoft that needed to be custom added so am now looking for more and just updated and repaired Framework 4. Theres anothe for the Intel but wouldnt work saying my 32 was not allowing it or didnt have it- so found that
 old update and am reinstalling it now to see if thats the issue.<br />
I have a Dell Optiplex Gx270 which though it was fairly new to me, its been in storage for 6 1/2 yrs without being updated at all. I just wanted to bring it up to speed as a back up computer.&nbsp;<br />
After this other update if &nbsp;its working I am going to try restarting with the tapping to the F2 says goes to boot and F12 says goes to bios, are written on my opening page as I bought this as a refurb in 2010.&nbsp;<br />
If I can get to alter the bios and alt boot then I should be able to get flash drive to run- as is I cant even load the Win10 product key anywhere yet.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ave</p>

<p>Hi Shenan,</p>
<p>Optiplex GX270 XP Pro 00045.4.97-108.574</p>
<p>version 5.1.2600 SP3 Build 2600 x86 &nbsp;Intel Pentium R 4 CPU 2.8GHZ</p>
<p>Tag 0932RY</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn on the computer it shows the Dell screen with the F2 and F12 notations in upper right corner, however my keyboard doesnt light up until after the XP screen appears which by then is too late and the keyboard doesnt light til the microsoft password
 is required, then the right side of my keyboard lights up and goes off and then the keys work. That is why no matter how long or fast I click the F2 or the F8 or the F12 [tried at separate restarts] or even the Toshiba way of holding down the "0" while turning
 the computer on will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to convert the ISO file on the flash into an executable file that could be done in Run?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked BIOS in sys info and its the same one listed on the Dell site though I did re-upload it and screen flickered and restarted pc, still couldnt access to change the boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is the ISO file will only open to be read and does nothing. </p>
<p>I also tried redownloading the file 2x at the Microsoft site using my newer computer as downloading it for use on a different computer which would be the Dell.</p>
<p>Beginning to think whoever refurbed it might have done something to prevent it from accessing the BIOS from F12 &nbsp;F2 maybe.</p>
<p>2 times I managed to get it to F8 window for safemode but again the keyboard had not engaged so I couldnt use the arrows to move to the selection nor could I click enter &nbsp;so after so many countdown seconds the computer started normal again in XP.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some older motherboards do not support USB keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you do not have a serial keyboard, than you might have to using a program to extract files from the ISO onto a DVD and boot the DVD.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Funny you said this about the keyboard~!</p>
<p>I signed off this computer and back onto the other but got my old keyboard which was a&nbsp;<br />
Dell with the round plug thing on it that recently I bought a USB adapter for to use on my HP but it didnt work so I put it away. Anyway I thought that it was worth a try to put this other Dell keyboard on the Dell and try it and it did get me into the boot~!</p>
<p>I got as far as it letting me select a USB to boot from and restarted and did get to the page to choose 32 but or the other so chose the 32 and the files loaded -- again and again.</p>
<p>Next it told me to select F! or F2 so I went around in circles for hours, checked the BIOS and tried a few different configs for the boot but none worked as it returned to the choose 32 or the other and reloaded files and then went to the F1 F2 choice page
 and then mentioned an error finally -</p>
<p>It said error &nbsp;asd showed File:\\windows\system32\boot5\winload.exe &nbsp;status 0xc0000017 error</p>
<p>I tried restarting several more times but it would go back to the XP and the page was semi frozen and the cmd which usually shows mention redirecting domain to &nbsp;domain1 with a file that &nbsp;had the brackets initially going \\\this direction is rewritten file
 name changing the bracket direction to //// but this has been like that since I got the computer and usually disappears in a few seconds and refers to some log.<br />
Anyway now it gets a message about timing out.</p>
<p>So here I am going to erase my flash drive and try to get another clean copy on the flash drive since the pc mentioned an error file so maybe this time it will work, although progress as this other Dell keyboard does at least let me get to the boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Last attempt before my trip I was able to get the older keyboard to work so was trying to load win 10 &nbsp;before leaving for Texas. When I return in Sept I hope to get that computer up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I bought a Toshiba Satellite with xp &amp; ubuntu on it and had it shipped to my Texas location and was able to remove the ubuntu and restore it to xp before purchasing a win 10 pro license and dowloaded &nbsp;it to this laptop which is now running and
 usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have separate issues with the win 10 pro on this Toshiba laptop that will have to try and fix while here in Texas. It has older drivers that dont want to update with win 10 so installed new driver pact fromToshiba that appears to have its own set of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help &nbsp;everyone.</p>

<p>You need to follow these steps before you try and upgrade to 10 or anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have the correct system requirements and that your Computer Manufacturer supplies the correct Drivers for 10.</p>

<h2>            The Crew only giving me option to start a trial.</h2>
                    
<p>Don't know if this is the right place for this but this morning a couple people including myself noticed that if you attempt to play The Crew which we all downloaded and installed sometime last month for Games With Gold. It is as if we do not own the game
 anymore, upon starting it up it asks me to start my free trial or go to the store and buy the game. As I stated, I already own this game, have had it for about a month and have played it a few times without any issue. Now all of a sudden, the last day it is
 available through GWG, I can't play it anymore. I really hope this is an error and not some kind of new Games With Gold model.</p>

<p>Hello there Wessmonster, </p>
<p>May I know if you still have an active Live Gold subscription?</p>
<p>If not, you'll be covered by one of the disclaimers of Xbox Live subscription.</p>
<p>"Games with Gold offer for paid Gold members only; active Gold membership required to play downloaded Xbox One games. Each participating game (selected by Xbox) available for download from Xbox Store during specific window; available games may vary by country"</p>
<p>You can see that from the bottom of the page of this link.</p>

                    Why this Nadela dude thinks everyone would like this forceful way of getting windows 10 updates without a consent? I tried to stop the updates in any possible way : First i tried by disabling the windows update service then i tried with policies and then
 with registry and nothing happens. Every time there is an update it stops and proceeds to install the updates and then restart in the middle of MY WORK!!!!! That is why Linux will always F@!#$K you up every single time and now that the new imac comes with
 a xeon and a decent vega graphics you are the least possible option Microsoft go f#$$%ing DIE

            <p>I've run into the same problem. It doesn't appear to be lack of disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Win 10 upgraders have mentioned they've seen problems where more than one EFI partition has been present... and that leads me to surmise that our Transformer problem has to do with the extra hidden repair partition (the big 8GB one after the NTFS partition)
 that Asus put on our disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I would boot into linux and copy the partition elsewhere to back it up, then delete it. But since it's got a tablet BIOS, we can't do that. I don't want to delete that, so intend to look around for a windows tool that will allow me to back that
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I find out anything further, I'll let you know.</p>

            <p>I got the same problem and I don't have the DVD disc (I don't think Asus provided the DVD), what shall I do?</p>
<p>In my case, I used the 64g micro sd card to provid the extra space that needed to upgrad from Window 8.1 to 10. Apparently, the attempted upgrad failed and the computer was trying to restore to the perilous version but stucked in repeating loops and unable
 to boot.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It was after updating process but appealingly failed, so the computer was trying to revert to the original 8.1. At this point, the computer began endless re-booting cycles once the message "......restore to the original......"appeared at the bottom of the
 screen.</p>
<p>Since I have only about 3G left in the computer and the updates required 5G, so I have to use the 64G SD card for downloading and installing. I did try to remove it but only being ask to inert the card.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just attempted to upgrade my Asus t100 to Win10 to only find that it has crashed my computer completely. It is trying to "restore previous version of windows" but does not do anything except continuously restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching for solutions all day but can only find options that are only accessible with actually having windows open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is stuck on black screen, cannot restore versions, Ive downloaded Win10 iso to attempt to boot via usb drive to which it displays the error in a pop up window "please insert external storage media and press ok" (which I have done) and have done
 the same with Win8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im about to call it quits on Windows OS computers and switch to something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide a solution to either revert back to Win8.1 or install Win10 the right way</p>

            <p>Hi Travis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with booting the computer from USB drive, there may be issues with the ISO file or with the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to connect the drive to different device and check if it is working fine. Try to format the drive, download new copy of Windows 10 ISO file, copy on to the flash drive boot the device and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists,&nbsp;I recommend you to use different flash drive, copy the newly downloaded ISO file, try the boot the device and check if it helps. Also, you can connect the drive to different ports and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer: <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 ISO file download</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of this issue, we will be happy to help you further.</p>

    <title>Photos app doesnt show any of my pictures &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. kshitij tiwari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos app doesnt show any of my pictures &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a HDD partition (H:) with a Pictures folder in it. &nbsp;I followed the Settings App&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Save location and included Drive H:&nbsp;where pictures will save to. &nbsp;The folder now appears under the pictures library and when using the File Explorer I can
 see them just fine. &nbsp;However, when I run the Photos app on the start menu it says it sees&nbsp;2 folder... the default pictures folder that came with installation and other is the H: Pcitures folder. &nbsp;That folder exists here: "C:\Users\"user"\Pictures\". &nbsp;I was
 hoping to keep my pictures on my H:&nbsp;drive&nbsp;And not my default C:&nbsp;Windows installation one... isn't this a fairly common setup? &nbsp;Why can't Photos detect these pictures? &nbsp; Pictures and videos aren't detected in Collection tab nor in Albums tab</p>
<div>There are also some videos mixed in with the photos.... &nbsp;I have also included H:\Pictures in the Photos Library. &nbsp;Probably the same problem.</div>
<div>Pictures are in .jpg format, videos in .avi.</div>
<p>Earlier it used to detect these photos once I accidentally removed the folder from Photos app setiings.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fb5feea-befd-46af-84a3-dbcbadedb50c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fb5feea-befd-46af-84a3-dbcbadedb50c" /></a></p>
<p>It can be seen that I have added the folders which I wanted to</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad6817ec-8ef7-4b3f-bb9f-8b8628192f29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad6817ec-8ef7-4b3f-bb9f-8b8628192f29" /></a></p>
<p>Still they are not detected even after adding and removing these folders multiple times as well as restarting the PC</p>

            <p>Your folder configuration seems fine to me. My suggestion is always to use a better image viewer and get rid of the dumb Photos app altogether, but perhaps you can try this: Right-click C:\Users\<em>username</em>\Pictures &gt; Properties &gt; Location tab and
 use the Move button to change the default location of the folder to D:\<em>username</em>\Pictures. Now launch Photos and see if it's able to display images in the latter location or not.</p>

<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.
<br />
<br />Transfer Skype Credits through Gifting

<br />
<br />Transfer Contacts

<br />
<br />Optionally, if you want to close an account after the required transfer but if this is attached to a Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed which has its own ramifications.

            <p>Ouch - in that case there's not a lot I can do to assist.</p>
<p>The problem with the non-genuine notice is that it's telling you that the PC can not longr read the certificate in teh BIOS SLIC table that allows the OEM_SLP Key to self-activate.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to change the Key to the one on your COA sticker - but you say that you are unable to read the Key there.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the only things you can do are </p>
<p>1) recreate the Licensing Store - in case it's a minor software problem causing the misread&nbsp; (see below)<br />
2) try updating the BIOS to the latest available Vista-compliant one, from the manufacturer's website
<br />
3) Contact the manufacturer direct, and see if they can provide assistance to correct the SLIC table
<br />
4) a reformat and reinstall using the manufacturer's recovery media <br />
5) purchase a new license for Windows (or a new computer)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please first try recreating the Licensing Store.</p>
<p>Recreate the Licensing Store <br />
1) Click Start button.<br />
2) Type: CMD.exe into the 'Search programs and files' field <br />
3) Right-Click on CMD.exe and select Run as Administrator<br />
4) Type: net stop sppsvc (It may ask you if you are sure, select yes)<br />
Note: the Software Protection service may not be running, this is ok.<br />
5) Type: cd %windir%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareProtectionPlatform<br />
6) Type: rename tokens.dat tokens.bar<br />
7) Type: cd %windir%\system32<br />
8) Type: net start sppsvc<br />
9) Type: slui.exe<br />
10) After a couple of seconds Windows Activation dialog will appear. You may be asked to re-activate and/or re-enter your product key or Activation may occur automatically.</p>
<p><br />
Reboot and Post back with a new MGADiag report<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Do you have the search box in the normal explorer window?</div>
<div>It seems that the Windows search is disabled fom the Windows Components. Let us enable the Windows search and check if we get the search bar back in start menu.<br />
Here is how:<br />
1. Go to&nbsp;control panel&nbsp;and in then programs and features.<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Windows Search and place a check mark in front of it.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For additional information about turning windows features on or off refer to the article below.</div>
<div><strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong><br />

    <title>Updgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 10 help needed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paula80x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 10 help needed</h2>
                    <p>I am upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 10. I have purchased a full retail version of Windows 10. My computer, although old, has been upgraded and has all the correct specs to run the operating system, including a 250gb SSD. My system is 32-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I have to do a clean install, and I am following steps to undertake this, one of the first of which is to download the correct version of Media Creation Tool. This is where I'm having problems. I have downloaded and tried to run different versions
 of the Media Creation tool and keep getting error messages when I try to run Setup.exe. I have tried MediaCreationTool1803 and the Windows 10 ISO (64-bit). Should I be using the 32-bit ISO? I read if I have 4gb RAM I should use 64-bit?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the error messages I get from different Setup.exe files:</p>
<p>When downloaded from Microsoft through a Windows 10 computer:</p>
<p>"E:\MediaCreationTool1803.exe is not a valid Win 32 application"</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the purchased Windows 10 Installation Media (32-bit, 64-bit, and main one)</p>
<p>"Windows installation cannot be started from the current operating system. To install Windows, boot from the installation media, or upgrade from a supported operating system and restart the installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a similar message when I use the 64-bit Windows 10 ISO I downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the 32-bit ISO work, or do I need to do something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi PaulA80X,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 10 is not possible. What you can do is to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 7, then from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Only Windows 7 or a later operating system is eligible for upgrade. You may also refer to this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-upgrade-paths" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know more about the Windows upgrade paths. However, doing this will take a lot of time plus the it
 may cause a lot of issues. The best route would be doing a Windows 10 clean install. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">article</a></strong> to know how. Just to set your exception,
 you will be needing a new Windows 10 product key for the activation process.</p>
<p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed?

            1. When does your current McAfee subscription expire?
<br />
<br />2. In File Explorer [WinKey+E], navigate to &amp; right-click on: 
<br />
<br />. ‚Ä¢ C:\Program Files (x86)\McAfee &lt;=this folder 
<br />
<br />Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?
<br />
<br />3. Which upgrade (e.g., Fall Creators Update AKA Windows 10 Version 1709) necessitated the "reinstall" of McAfee Internet Security?
<br />
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.
<br /> 
<br />Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.

            1. Have you or have you not reinstalled the McAfee application? 
<br />
<br />2. Assuming you haven't, is Windows Defender enabled (turned on) &amp; working properly? How about the Windows Firewall?
<br />
<br />3. No more errors since you ran the removal tool, correct?

            So no further problems, even with all those updates newly installed, correct?
<br />
<br />Are you a Windows Insider and if so, are you in the Fast ring or the Slow ring (not Skip Ahead)? I ask because Microsoft hasn't made a public page available for KB4041994 which appears to have been released to Insider Fast and Slow rings on or shortly after 21 September 2017 - and possible revised &amp; relreased a few days ago. T'is a mystery to me.
<br />
<br />That being said, do you want to risk reinstalling the McAfee application offered by your ISP? Speaking of which, who is your ISP (e.g., Cox; Charter; Verizon)?

<p>No more problems for the last 20 hours. I have run every program / app on my laptop with no errors whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not on the insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not yet ready to say the culprit is McAfee. I'm leaning towards the driver updates correcting the problem since they were installed before I removed McAfee. That being said, I have not re-installed McAfee. I must admit every program / app seems to run
 smoother and faster without McAfee.&nbsp; I think I'll wait a few weeks to see how the laptop performs without McAfee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My provider is Shaw</p>

<p>Hi mbw82ag,</p>
<p>Is it only with respect to a particular .gif file or for all the files with the same format mentioned?</p>
<p>Does Microsoft Paint work with other file formats?</p>
<p>Microsoft Paint very much supports .gif file format and should open the file unless the file itself is corrupted.</p>
<p>To pin down the factor causing this, try opening other file formats or other files with the same format. If they open up fine, then the application is fine and it is highly likely that the concerned file is corrupted.<br />
<br />
If the files don‚Äôt open up, try opening with some other application like Windows photo viewer. To open with Windows photo viewer, right-click on the image and select "Preview".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can even try Windows Live Photo Gallery for that matter of fact. Download is available at<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://download.live.com/photogallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://download.live.com/photogallery</strong></a><br />
<br />
This will help in determining what‚Äôs causing this problem: : the application itself or the file.&nbsp; Please post back this information so that we can extend our help on the cited issue.</p>
