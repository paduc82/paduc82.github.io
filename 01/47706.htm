<h2>            Intel 9260 &#34;Device cannot start&#34; - upon tweaking, working normally as &#34;AC 9260 &#35;2&#34;. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This may be a bug with either Windows, or with the Intel driver - however, I am posting it in the Windows forum because I believe there may be a fault with the way Windows is identifying this hardware when multiple Intel drivers have in the past been installed
 and configuration information remains in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I got to this place:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have a laptop with an Intel 3168NGW card. Card has a fault resuming from standby, forum search reveals that this is a known fault with this card so I replace it with the 9260.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 9260 card fails to start. I figure there may be a driver conflict, so I uninstall the card from device manager with "delete drivers for this device" and restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 9260#2 shows up and works. All good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Suspend laptop, resume a while later. 9260 in device manager with "device failed to start". 9260#2 is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstall again, restart. This time it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Download latest Intel drivers from web site. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstall device, manually delete all physical driver files from hard drive, reboot + reinstall. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Trawl through registry, locate driver entry (\Enum\PCI\blabla) for the 9260 card - entry is undeletable, driver database must be protected. Great. I'll just download a registry tool from the interne . . . oh, right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Notice there is an entry for 9260 #2 and that it has different parameters. Copy the ParentIdPrefix from 9260 # 2 to the normal 9260 and restart. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Check bios. No option to configure devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Reboot, open registry. Copy "driver" entry from 9260#2 reg key to 9260 &amp; reboot. Device is now disabled. Enable device. It still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Re open registry, copy compatibleIDs from 9260#2 to 9260 &amp; reboot. I notice the "friendly name" is now gone from the original 9260. After reboot, device is disabled again. Enable device. It works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Check registry. compatible ID changes have not been preserved. Other changes have been. Conclude witchcraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Go on Windows forum to post this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might have something to do with BIOS. Since you've already tried several troubleshooting steps but the issue still persists, we recommend getting in touch with your computer manufacturer, so they can assist you in updating your BIOS.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>

<p>I have tried updating the bios as well as all other manufacturer devices. Bios version is from last month and drivers are latest from Intel web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer states that they do not restrict use of any wireless card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further steps taken since last post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled windows from scratch and re set up all devices. The machine seemed to be working and I even restarted a couple of times, but this morning the same problem has re occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking the device manager, the system has once again created a "#2" version of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The event log contained the following messages&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Has determined that the network adapter is not functioning properly" x3</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Could not allocate the resources necessary for operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The version number is incorrect for this driver" x2</p>
<p><br />
(Then a bunch of windows update related messages, it seems like the setup manager has tried to connect to windows update to get a driver. Again, the latest driver is already installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Requires further installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Trouble allocating resources" / "could not allocate resources"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Failed to start"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I then attempted to manually install the drivers from the Intel driver directory created by the original driver installer. Upon selecting the correct driver from "have disk &gt; next &gt; browse " the system bluescreened with "kernel secure error".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon restarting, the event log messages referring to " Trouble allocating resources", etc, have gone from the device events. It looks like the system has created yet another device with the same name (still #2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have 4 x "Requires further installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1x"Device was configured"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Concluded process to install device&nbsp; . . . status 0x0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Had a problem starting "</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the main event log, more "trouble allocating resources" , etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reliably reproduce the bluescreen error simply by going to device manager &gt; update driver &gt; have disk, and selecting the displayed auto - selected driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled and reinstalled the device. No more bluescreen for this procedure, but device doesn't work either.</p>
<p>

<p>I have now disabled secure boot in the BIOS and the driver is once again working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to fathom why SB would have this effect, as the driver was able to install and was able to function properly for a period of time. SB should have disabled the device altogether right from the get go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if perhaps having hyper-v network adapters is causing subtle changes in the way that the driver manager attempts to initialise network devices, sometimes falling foul of SB and sometimes not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The main issue here seems to be the inconsistency of failure mode. The device also worked after wipe and then failed again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will in any case re post to this thread if the problem re occurs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So it happened again. This time in event viewer there was a message that the device had failed to resume from an idle power state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager right click &gt; disable caused the computer to hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are posts elsewhere on the internet about some Intel cards failing to resume from standby, but not this model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it may still be an issue with the power management in the Intel driver but right now I have nothing to go on.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System Restore vs Refresh&#58; Which Method is Preferable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exmoviebuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore vs Refresh&#58; Which Method is Preferable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed a printer about six months ago and it was working OK. &nbsp;<em>Sometime over the past 4-5 months, something happened which made the printer stop working.
</em>&nbsp;Now all it prints is unintelligible garbage. &nbsp;I suspect a monthly <strong>Microsoft Update (Windows 8.1)</strong> is to blame. &nbsp;I can't pinpoint exactly when the problem occurred because I don't print frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first inclination was to do a <strong>system restore</strong> back to a time when the printer was working, but the earliest restore point shown on control panel is only three weeks ago. &nbsp;Is there a way to find previous restore points? &nbsp;If so, would doing
 a <strong>system restor</strong><strong>e</strong> be preferable to a <strong>system refresh</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't find a restore point six months back, should I do a <strong>system refresh</strong> or is there something else I should try first? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only offered restore points up to 3 weeks ago, that's it.</p>
<p>It depends on allocated space for system restore as to how many restore points there are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, a refresh won't help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall/reinstall the printer using the latest drivers from HP.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must be missing something. &nbsp;Although my <strong>computer</strong> is HP, I'm trying to install an
<strong>Epson</strong> 9-pin dot matrix printer. &nbsp;If HP has a printer driver for me, how would I find it? &nbsp;All of their drivers appear to be for HP printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How was I able to successfully install the printer six months ago using the "Generic IBM 9-pin" driver that came with Win 8.1? &nbsp;I've done very little printing since then, but it did print a couple of pages OK at that time. &nbsp;See test page below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b161010-b58a-4f8a-ab61-a22df02a3861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b161010-b58a-4f8a-ab61-a22df02a3861" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't believe that I have to throw away a perfectly good printer just because I upgraded to a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Epson website, the <strong>ActionPrinter T-1000</strong> works with DOS, Win 3.1, Win 95, Win 98, and Win NT only. &nbsp;I called Epson and they said they don't have a driver for Win 8.1, but that the printer might work if I was using a software
 program that had its own Epson compatible driver. &nbsp;They could not offer me anything more than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What I don't understand is how I got the printer to work before by installing the</em>
<strong>Generic IBM 9-pin driver</strong> <em>that came with Windows.</em> &nbsp;See the test page in my previous post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer doesn't even need a driver in DOS -- I used it for years with an old Tandy PC running DOS 3.2 and it worked just fine. &nbsp;Then, when I upgraded to Win 98, I got the ability to print better graphics and a choice of dozens of fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to run the printer inside a DOS or Win 98 emulator? &nbsp;I'm currently running some older DOS programs in DOSBOX but my version doesn't support printing.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> javelin-p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have reviewed many different posts about task bars not working, but none seem to do any good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I can see the task bar. The icons I have on the task bar work (Task View, Microsoft Edge, etc.) I can also click the up arrow on the right hand side of the task bar and it will reveal what it should and I can access those programs from there.
 However, that is where the functionality ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot open the start menu, through keyboard or desktop. I cannot access the sound panel, internet connection panel, notification centre, or the date and time. (Yes, I can see the icons and the time and date. No, I cannot access them through the task bar).
 Cortana will usually respond through mic and most of the time, but not all of the time, I can type within Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever it boots, it temporarily works, and then sometime very shortly after the bootup has finished is when this occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*****Edit 3/10/16 *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new system update became available, and after downloading/installing the system update, the task bar has fixed itself. Cortana will still randomly respond to things that I say while speaking over skype/CV/etc. but that is a problem that has persisted since
 she has been included in the OS and I believe Cortana is a separate problem being worked consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cannot find a way to close this thread myself, I would ask an admin to do so. I cannot label any of the answer as helpful or as the answer, seeing as the solution was to wait for a new system update (as mine was already up to date at the time of posting
 the question, making that answer invalid at the time submitted). I do appreciate the effort in trying to figure out what the problem was, but we will probably never know.

    <title>Xbox One upnp failing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judemyers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One upnp failing</h2>
                    So my xbox one periodically, maybe twice a day, fails the upnp and creates a moderate nat making online gaming pretty unplayable. My only fix is to reset everything, router and modem specifically or also going into the modem settings to reset the upnp.
 A quicker fix is just to restart the console and that seems to work just as well. I was wondering if anyone could shed some knowledge to prevent this entirely. Btw I am connected wirelessly which I have suspected to be the main problem. I can’t move the router
 to me as it isn’t mine to do so for a direct connection.

<p><span>Hi
<span>Frank St,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which web browser are you using? Does this happen on a particular website or every web site?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide the complete error message you receive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know what files you are trying to download for better understanding of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem might be temporary.
</span><span>Wait a few minutes, and then retry your operation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
<span>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-ons" mode and test</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>To determine whether the error is caused by an add-on, run Internet Explorer in "No Add-ons" mode. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, and then type <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> in the <strong>
Start Search</strong> box. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur,
<strong>try step 2.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>If no errors occur, the problem is caused by one of the add-ons that typically load together with Internet Explorer. In this case,
 follow the steps mentioned in the link to <strong>determine which add-on is causing the issue</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Optimize internet explorer</span></strong></p>

    <title>Windows 8 background became black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikhil52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 background became black</h2>
                    <p>My windows background went from the attack on titan background I had to black for no apparent reason. I've read some answers to other similar problems that suggested that a virus may be to blame but I don't think that is the case. I'll walk you through what
 happened immediately before the desktop became black:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to open Matlab by clicking on the windows icon in the bottom left corner of the screen and simply typed in "Matlab" since that usually brings up the program I want without having to explicitly click "search." For whatever reason, the computer lagged
 for a few seconds before a search bar came up with Matlab typed into it. The Matlab icon hadn't come up yet so I clicked search a few times (the computer was running really slow) and then the screen froze on a red background, the background that comes up for
 about a second when windows is searching for the program you want, before returning to a google chrome window that I had opened earlier. Matlab had not opened, and my background was now black. The day prior to this happening, I had run a full system virus
 scan and it had confirmed that there are no viruses on my computer. I also tried to restart my computer immediately after it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know what went wrong that my background became black, and what I can do to fix it? I will try to run my computer in safe mode just in case but again, I strongly believe that a virus is not to blame for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all of your help in advance!</p>

 reset the folder options for that folder so that I could view the protected operating system files, I found that files are being created daily, 2-3 Gb each. &nbsp;I cannot delete them. &nbsp;I have tried changing access, but haven't had success with that. &nbsp;They are
 listed as system files. &nbsp;There are 2 listed for each created file, both enclosed in {}. &nbsp;There is a file called MountPointManagerRemoteDataBase also. &nbsp;My backup and restore screen shows that Windows Backup has not been set up.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I use Macrium Reflect and back up to an external drive. &nbsp;I noticed that my 300 Gb D drive has only 43 Gb free. &nbsp;When I opened the drive, the file titled System Volume Information showed over 200GB, but I couldn't see what was filling the folder. &nbsp;When I
 reset the folder options for that folder so that I could view the protected operating system files, I found that files are being created daily, 2-3 Gb each. &nbsp;I cannot delete them. &nbsp;I have tried changing access, but haven't had success with that. &nbsp;They are
 listed as system files. &nbsp;There are 2 listed for each created file, both enclosed in {}. &nbsp;There is a file called MountPointManagerRemoteDataBase also. &nbsp;My backup and restore screen shows that Windows Backup has not been set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this creation of files and delete the ones already made? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>System Volume Information</strong> folder is where all of the <strong>
System Restore</strong> and <strong>Previous Versions</strong> shadow copies of files are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the following procedure to remove the older System Restore and previous Versions of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Start</strong> and type&nbsp; <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>&nbsp; in the <strong>
Search</strong> Box. In the <strong>Results</strong>, right click <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> and select the
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the <strong>Drive</strong> you want to clean up and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the program <strong>scans the drive</strong>, check all of the files you want to
<strong>remove</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, click the <strong>More Options</strong> Tab. In the <strong>Sytem Restore and Shadow Copies</strong> section, click the
<strong>Clean up</strong> Button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button in the&nbsp;confirmation popup to delete all but&nbsp;the&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;<strong>System Restore point</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait for the program to remove all of the selected files. Check the disk space that is currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also open Control Panel and select System. On the left side of the window, click System Protection. Select your System drive (C:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Configure button. This is where you can set the System Restore settings, including the Max Usage for the System Restore files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 temporary profile</h2>
                    <p>Periodically when I log on with Windows 7 Professional it signs me on with a temporary profile. None of my files are accessible. I have to shut down and log on again. Usually it then signs on with my personal settings. How do I keep the "temporary profile"

<h2>            Windows 10 update version 1607 fails repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 update version 1607 fails repeatedly on most of our fairly new Dell laptops. The update downloads and installation goes for an hour or so, then the computer restarts and spends half an hour going back to the previous version. We are running Windows
 10 Enterprise 64 bit, Version 1511 with Bitlocker enabled.&nbsp;We have tried Windows Update Trouble-shooter - no errors show, switching off anti-virus - no change,&nbsp;and also updating from DVD with latest version&nbsp;from ISO - Still won't update</p>

<p>Windows 10 update version 1607 fails repeatedly on most of our fairly new Dell laptops. The update downloads and installation goes for an hour or so, then the computer restarts and spends half an hour going back to the previous version. We are running Windows
 10 Enterprise 64 bit, Version 1511 with Bitlocker enabled.&nbsp;We have tried Windows Update Trouble-shooter - no errors show, switching off anti-virus - no change,&nbsp;and also updating from DVD with latest version&nbsp;from ISO - Still won't update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

Hi, I had a similar problem updating Win 10 1511 to 1607: after running about half-way, the update stopped with a message that some apps have to be uninstalled manually, and there&nbsp;appears&nbsp;what should be a list of the offending apps. But the list is empty. The
 id "hovböld" showed how to identify the offending apps: the file C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Panther\(.....)APPRAISER_HumanReadable.xml has entries containing "BlockingApplication", followed by an entry "LowerCaseLongPath", which Points the app that has to be
 removed. After doing that, Windows Update completed without errors.

            <p>Thanks for reply. Checked this out on a couple of machines and the entries in APPRAISER_HumanReadable.xml&nbsp; file are slightly different. In the &lt;ASSET&gt; &lt;PropertyList Type="Inventory"&gt; we only get a single entry - &lt;Property Value="PassiveMatchingInfo" Name=AssetType!"/&gt;
 then on to DataSource.</p>
<p>Then lower down for&nbsp;BlockingApplication it just says Ordinal="1"/.</p>
<p>I haven't been getting a message <span>"You must remove these applications manually and then selecting Update" or any message at all during the upgrade process.</span></p>

            <p>Not sure yet but found this problem and solution with Avast anti-Virus which looks to have worked on one of our machines. haven't yet fully tested this as it takes several hours to re-download - update and restart etc etc. but looks good on first machine.</p>

                    <span>
<p>I'm trying to upgrade from Vista 64-bit to Windows 7 64-bit. The Upgrade Advisor has given me the all-clear but the installation itself always stops at the Compatibility Report, which tells me I need to uninstall Nero Burning ROM. So far I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstalled all Nero products from my computer </li><li>ran check disk </li><li>tried uninstalling Nero on diagnostic startup </li><li>tried running Nero's own cleanup tool </li><li>reinstalled and uninstalled a trial version of Nero </li></ul>
<div>all to no avail - I still get the same message from the Compatibility Report. Any ideas what the problem might be, or am I going to have to do a clean install?</div>
<div><br />

<br />
I got the same error when using Movie Maker. After this error I can't open my project and have to start over again (until the program shuts down again).<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you help me?<br />

            I have been having a similar problem and re-installed several times with no luck. mpg video files respond but png files cause Movie Maker to behave as described by the other users.<br />

I have created the files as requested - the event logs and the system info files.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Classic View</h2>
                    
<div><span>
<p>I recently installed a trial version of Windows 7 Ultimate x64 to try out before spending a few hundred dollars to upgrade from XP x64.&nbsp; I was immediately disappointed to learn that the Start Menu, Task Bar and Control Panel can not be set to a XP/Vista
 classic view.&nbsp; I was also&nbsp;amazed how tedious they made the control panel to navigate. So my question is can this be changed? Am I just missing something in the options to change the view? Any help would be great.<br />
<br />
I hope Windows 7 teams watches these forums..</p>

<h2>            Remote Computer Management - Local Users and Groups not available after Win 10 Pro Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to access the local users and groups on a remote file server from the computer management console. I have used this capability for years to manage the file server users passwords and accounts. I now see a check mark and a red X saying&nbsp; "Unable
 to access the computer XXXXX. The error was: the system cannot find the file specified. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked just fine for me before the anniversary update, just last week. This remote management allows me to control the access to the file server from my office rather than march down the hall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions? Fixes? Others experiencing the same problem?</p>

            Razvan, <br />
<br />
<br />
We need to know more info about this regard. There could have been network security credentials that are not being recognized by your PPPOE over WAN. Are you using a VPN connection? Can you share us the purpose on having this connection (PPPOE) over WAN, instead
 of Ethernet?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few things to be checked will include your Antivirus security settings not blocking the connection. Also check the firewall settings, the connection should also be allowed. Please check
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-turn-windows-firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">if turning off the Windows Firewall temporarily will get rid of the error</a></span></em>.
 If the error is gone while it is turned off, please change your Firewall settings according to your ISP.
<br />
<br />
For more accurate solutions. the best to contact is your ISP, and your modem manufacturer.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards. <br />

    <title>How to print an open window&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to print an open window&#63;</h2>
                    I opened a DVD with a lot of songs I had burned on it.&nbsp; I wanted to copy that playlist to a word file, or just print it.&nbsp; I could not do that from the window.&nbsp; The Print option in Share was grayed out.&nbsp; I made a Print Screen and pasted it into Word, but
 that seems awkward.&nbsp; Why can we not print any open, active window? &nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but it doesn't help me since:</p>
<ol>
<li>The update that Noel refers to is KB3004394 and this is not an update I have installed recently (if at all); and,</li><li>From MSDIAG, my Windows Product ID is 00371-177-0000061-85376. The "177" part of this code does not match the codes identified as being blocked MSDN keys. I have Windows 7 Professional.</li></ol>
<p><br />
I have tried to validate Windows 7 at http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/, but keep getting this message: "The validation service couldn't determine whether the copy of Windows that is running on your computer is genuine. Please try to validate Windows
 again. If you keep getting validation errors, try to again later or contact support."</p>

            <p>There seems to be a trend here towards posting links to other threads where something has been marked as an answer, but there isn't actually any feedback as to whether the "answer" actually resolved the problem. In my case, I have returned to this thread
 because a reply was marked as an "answer" but my problem still exists. I have since unmarked the "answer".&nbsp;I suspect that a proper diagnosis of the problem is likely to require someone to look at the MGA Diagnostic report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Responding to the links posted above, I have tried to validate online but my key has not been accepted. While I haven't tried phone activation, searches of other threads and forums suggest that if the key is not accepted online, then phone activation won't
 work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a system restore point to undo the installation of the updates which caused the "Build 7601. This copy of Windows is not genuine" message to appear. This caused the "Build 7601..." message to disappear, but it re-appeared when the updates were reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to re-install Windows 7 and my version of MS Office, then I'm prepared to do that. But using the keys that I have, I haven't been able to get downloads for those products from Microsoft and am reluctant to use files hosted by others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I've been scammed and my versions of Windows 7 and MS Office aren't genuine, but I've been using this system for over a year without any problems or indication that they weren't genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've re-run the MGA Diagnostic tool and posted the output below. Strangely enough, it's different from the original report in that it no longer contains "Tampered File: %systemroot%\system32\slui.exe|slui.exe.mui|COM Registration". But I believe this line
 may be significant: "Notification Reason: 0xC004F009 (grace time expired)." Following a suggestion in another thread, I went to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System and, under "Windows activation" is a message "You must activate today. Active Windows
 now." On attempting to activate, I receive an error dialog box: "C:\Windows\system32\slui.exe. Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." I've also tried running "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">slui.exe</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4",
 but get the same error message.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the latest MGA Diagnostic output:</p>

            <p>I ran a utility called WAT Fix.exe, then ran the Microsoft legitimate check tool and got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows validation detected and repaired an activation exploit (used to prevent built-in Windows licensing components from operating properly). You must activate Windows in order to complete the repair process and be able to use the full functionality of
 Windows. Not to worry, we can help you with that."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't have a key that can be used to activate Windows, I've concluded that I've been scammed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the wonders of Microsoft pricing, it will be cheaper to get a refurbished PC with genuine Windows than to buy Windows directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't claim to be an expert, but my advice to others would be to verify their version of Windows immediately after purchase by using the MGA Diagnostic tool and Microsoft legitimate check tool. In my case, there was nothing to indicate that it wasn't genuine.</p>
