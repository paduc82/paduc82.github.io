    <title>XBOX One Turns Off Whilst Installing Digital Game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBOX One Turns Off Whilst Installing Digital Game</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>Got my xbox last night and plugged it in. It downloaded the day one patch fine. So i then went and claimed my Day One FIFA digital download. It was going slow but that was expected. It his 30% and I was able to play the Friendly Game Barcelona vs Real Madrid
 fine enough and thought I'll leave it to download. I also added Killer Instinct on download though doing so put Fifa in the Queue which was fine. I turned my TV off and let it download.</p>

<p>I left it on the whole night and when I woke up in the morning the XBOX wasn't on. I turned it on, and killer instinct only downloaded 25% whilst FIFA was stuck on 60%. I tried to resume the downloads but it didn't seemed to move.</p>

<p>I left it on to download again then left for work and I just rang home to check on it and it looks like it turned off automatically again. My power settings are "Instant" not the low savings settings so not sure why it's doing this. Is it possible it's not
 downloading anything so the XBOX is actually just sitting there idle hence why it turns off?</p>

<p>Is there a particular set of settings which will ensure it doesnt turn off/go to sleep whilst downloading?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help</p>

<p>Sounds like its set to turn off automatically. &nbsp;You can change that in power and startup when in settings.</p>

<p>Hi x24hrs2livex thanks for replying,</p>
<p>Thats what I thought. But I've now changed that to Never but the download is stuck on 61% and says "Ready to Play" though when i start Fifa all I can play is the Friendly game which you can play before. Is there something wrong with the download? Should
 I Delete Fifa and then re-download it?</p>

<p>Also, if I delete FIFA, does that mean I lose my Digital Fifa Copy? Or will it automatically figure out that I've registered the game so i cna redownload it?</p>

<p>Hi All, I managed to install battlefield with no problem but still struggling with Fifa 14. It keeps getting stuck in queue move at 61% and can't seem to get pass that. Has anyone else experienced this? I've cancelled and redownloaded a number of times even
 with power cycle.</p>

<p>The xbox one will automatically turn off after 1 hour of inactivity. Im pretty sure it shouldnt if you are downloading something, but it might be doing that. But since your games arent downloading correctly I would suggest, turning off your console, unplugging
 internet, then unplugging the powerbrick from wall outlet. Then wait 1-2 minutes. Plug it back up, except leave internet unplugged, if your using wifi, unplug your router, and start it up. It should do something with the downloads, hopefully show that they
 are finished. This is what I saw from a different youtubers video. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UPDATE- The reason the console shuts off is more than likely your games are done downloading, but your xbox shows they are still downloading.
 So the previous idea should work.</p>

<h2>            Black Screen with cursor at Start Up </h2>
                    
<p>original title: Trying to fix 2 systems with KSOD - this really is the pits</p>
<p>I currently have 2 Dell systems with Vista KSOD (Black screen, moving mouse pointer). One desktop and one laptop. Both are standard Intel systems with Intel graphics. They both got the issue after an automatic windows update. The laptop has had KSOD before,
 it was eventually fixed with a complete reformat and reinstall of Vista that time (after spending hours trying to find what had gone wrong) but I refuse to accept that a commercial OS can get itself into such a state by no fault of the user that this is the
 only recovery option. It just isn't good enough.</p>
<p>- Safe mode also results in KSOD<br />
- System Restore failed all the way back to the first available option.<br />
- Automatic repair finds no problem (does it ever)?<br />
- Chkdsk finds no problem<br />
- Loaded the original system and software registry hives from the recovery command prompt and checked the standard things, (Shell explorer.exe with no additions, RpcSs objectname loading under the correct user, unknown programs loading etc.<br />
- Replaced the software hive in windows\system32\config with the backup version. No difference.<br />
- Renamed the event log folder. No difference.<br />
- Scanned the disk for viruses from virus boot disk. No problems<br />
- Disable keyboard shortcut link missing from the sticky keys dialog - so can't get into running windows this way. This seems to be a new feature as I have used this way in in the past.<br />
- compared explorer.exe and userinit.exe against the same files on a good system - they are equivalent</p>
<p>Any suggestions on where to look for possible causes?</p>
<p>Have Microsoft made a patch available by now that makes it easier to track this issue down?</p>

<p>Possibly this troubleshooter can helps :<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1</a></p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>

<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try all the possible solutions you can, often a clean installation of Windows is required. You can<br />
save the data in Safe Mode if possible. Or put the hard drive into another computer as 2nd drive<br />
(best method) or into an External USB case. Either should allow you to copy the data to removable<br />
media such as CD, DVD, or other USB drives.<br />
<br />
The Black Screen is probably caused as&nbsp;much&nbsp;by lack of proper input to display as anything else.<br />
One reason they are so hard to deal with is the causes are so varied and there is often little information<br />
to go on.<br />
<br />
Did you try using the Task Manager to restart Explorer to see if that helps to gain some control?<br />
(How to as in the reply above.)<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 on an external hard drive &#40;Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install windows 10 on my 1tb ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a windows installer usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I boot into it and go through setup, it gives me the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup does not support installing windows on usb connected through a USB or IEEE 1394 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read articles talking about solving this problem with Regedit, but I do not know how to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Macs support booting instances of macOS on an external drive, not Windows or Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to setup a virtual machine with it instead and you can store the VDI on your SSD instead.

<p>"Remove everything and reinstall Windows" yes, removes everything on your PC, including any drivers you updated to W8, it does exactly as stated, but if you want a nice clean OS. Brand new in relation to the OS.</p>
<p>It is similar to what I do when installing a new OS,&nbsp;I always do a 'Clean Install'</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> <em>I "unlinked" my FB account - can't see how to "relink" it.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please be guided that, as of <strong>January 10, 2018,</strong> signing in to Skype using a Facebook account is no longer possible. In line with that, it is no longer possible to link or associate your Facebook account to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this link for additional information. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12126/can-i-sign-in-to-skype-with-my-facebook-account?q=facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I sign in to Skype with my Facebook account?</a></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last&nbsp;time Command.com was included in Windows&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Windows Millenium which was released in 2000. Command.com is the MS-DOS command line interpreter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Command.exe is the win32 version of the command line interpreter and has been included in every version of Windows since Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The fact is that "command.com" continues to work in Windows XP. <br />
<br />
Go to Start -&gt; Run, next type: command.com&nbsp;&nbsp; (and not "cmd")<br />
<br />
You will be able to continue to run 16 bit software.<br />
<br />
CMD will not do, you have to invoke command.com<br />
<br />
NTVDM.exe is what is loaded to run the 16 bit software but it is MS-DOS for all practical purposes. I run Microsoft's PDS with Btrieve 5x as the record manager with no problem.<br />
<br />
The question is: will Windows 8 allow PDS with Btrieve 5x to continue to run&nbsp; ?<br />
<br />
- It seems that command.com is not in Windows 8<br />
<br />
- It looks like all one can do is stick to Windows 7 32 bit or Windows 7 64 bit with Virtual-PC and Windows XP mode plus "HAV"..

<h2>            Folders too Big to Copy From External Hard Drive&#63;&#33; Huh&#63;</h2>
                    Today I purchased a new HP with Intel Quad Processor, 64 bit,&nbsp;8MG Ram running Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I bought it to catalog &amp; manage photos.&nbsp;
<em><strong>When I try to copy a large folder (3 GB or more) from my external USB hard drive to the internal hard drive, I see a dialog box that says "Preparing to Copy", with details of of folder source, and after about 15 seconds, the folder disappears and
 the files are not copied.</strong></em>&nbsp; HP says it's a known Windows problem but cannot fix it.&nbsp; Microsoft won't discuss it unless I commit to a $59 fee.&nbsp; The computer is less than 1-day old.&nbsp; Can someone help?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS - Smaller folders can be cpoied, but are very sllooww.

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What is the file system of the USB drive?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><br />
Try copying from DVD and see if you are able to copy successfully.<br />
<br />
If you are able to copy then there should be some issue with the USB drive.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to start your computer in safemode and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Follow this below provided link to start your computer in safemode.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
we will run chkdsk from&nbsp; Win RE (Windows Recovery Environment )mode and check for the issue, to do that follow the below steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To run check disk, you have to have Windows 7 DVD, boot the computer to Win RE from the elevated command prompt, and try to do a CHKDSK. You can follow these steps to run CHKDSK :</strong><br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Use the Windows 7 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE). <br />
2)&nbsp; In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;3) Click Repair your computer.<br />
&nbsp;4) Click the 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;5) Click Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk drive: /f and chkdsk drive: /r.<br />

<p>I have a problem. I redeemed a $25 card to my account from my computer. I checked the manage my payments, and it reads $25 in my account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Though, when I try to buy DLC from the xbox one, how can I actually use this $25? All it says is: add a credit card. How do I actually use the $25?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds like you'll need to speak to the Xbox team themselves as they have access to your billing and account information. You'll be able to request a call back if you'd like to use the credit asap (head over to the contact us page on:

            Why do we have to prove that Mac commercials are anything but false?<br />
<br />
Presumably the Dell Latitude 630 laptop, Dell have chosen NOT to supply Windows 7 compatible video drivers for your model, and had you checked with Dell before buying Windows 7 and upgrading, you would have found this out for yourself and maybe saved yourself
 time and money.<br />
<br />
The best you can do is to try the Vista 64 driver supplied by Dell, and if that doesn't work, revert back to whatever operating system for which you have installation media.<br />
<br />
You might want to contact Dell support and ask if they are ever likely to release Windows 7 drivers for THEIR hardware..

<p>Ok...the first thing is that i installed a game...works fine.<br />
<br />
I then tried to open up one of my friends mods...nothing happened. it said it needed to be reinstalled...so after many hours i found out how to do it. but it still wont open. i now have a message saying that it needs to be installed into the application directory.</p>

<p>- Which game?<br />
- Exact error message? <br />
- Is it Windows 7 ccompatible?</p>
<p>App directory in this (similar) case would be the "system32" directory which houses all the .dll files.</p>
<p>system32 = C:\Windows\system32</p>
<p>You can simply download the "binkw32.dll" files from a site you (absolutely) trust and drop it to the system32 folder.</p>
<p>Note that downloading .dll files from other sites has its own disadvantages.</p>
<p>Or reinstall the game. Install it as "admin" - right-click the installer and select 'run as admin'.</p>
<p>If the game ain't Windows 7 compatible, try installing it in XP/Vista compatible mode:</p>

    <title>Error &#34;Default gateway is missing&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickis71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error &#34;Default gateway is missing&#34;</h2>
                      Since installing win 7 on my PC a couple of weeks ago I constantly lose my connection to my router.<br />
The error reads "standardgateway is not avalible". The problem is fixed by rightclicking the network symbol down to the right on the panel, and choose "search for errors". Win 7 starts a diagnostool that corrects the error until next time it occures.<br />
Why does this happen?<br />
Has this something to do with my networkcard (witch has the latest drivers installed)?<br />
It's an Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000base-t controller.

However, I think I found the solutions on another site.<br />
The say that you have two options:<br />
<br />
1. Buy a new networkcard, Ahteros is aparently ____.<br />
<br />
2. Changes the driver settings.<br />
<br />
I went for solutiontion 2, and it seems to work.<br />

Here is a link to the solution:<br />

    <title>Missing Operating System after Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuxie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Operating System after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was downloading and installing windows 10 last night. I had downloaded during the day and when I came back from work, I allowed my laptop (Dell Latitude XT3) to install the files and upgrade my Os from 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>However, when I woke up this morning, I had simply received a message that said 'Missing Operating System' on a black screen with no option but to force cut the power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to this laptop having been bought from my school (when we graduate, they give us a option of buying it for cheap), I do not have any of the installation disks or USB either (and I cannot contact the school because of holidays). The only thing I have
 is my activation code, which probably won't do any good without an OS anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have previously installed Windows 10 once prior to this, and it had worked perfectly. However, due to compatibility issues, I had reverted back to Windows 8.1 once before (This was because I had to make a program work which refused to do so
 on Windows 10. I have no need for this program anymore, and therefore wanted to switch back to Windows 10). Now after reinstalling Windows 10 (Downloaded the 2.6GB files once more as well), I get the error I have mentioned above.<br />

</p><p>In the MBR days in windows 7 fixmbr command from the bootrec.exe restored the MBR. But, now in case of EFI fixmbr will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any command analogous to fixmbr which can restore my EFI partition.</p>

<p>You will need to download Windows 7 64 bit separately, burn it to a blank DVD then install it.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>If you purchased Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store:</p>
<p>Go to the Microsoft Store website, log in with your store account, select Download Options and select Windows 7 64 bit and proceed to download.</p>
<p>Please note, this is a clean install, all programs, device drivers will need to be reinstalled and you need to make sure you have 64 bit versions of your drivers.</p>
