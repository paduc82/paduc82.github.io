    <title>Getting error message when trying to access a shared folder in a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting error message when trying to access a shared folder in a workgroup</h2>
                    I purchased a backup solution and a 1TB external hard drive attached to computer "A"&nbsp;in a workgroup enviornment. I shared the hard drive out with permissions set to everyone and the users can access it just fine.<br />
<br />
Well I don't want everyone to access it so I created a local user account on computer "A" called itsupport and then set the permissions to only allow itsupport to access the share.<br />
<br />
I go to computer "B" and go to start run \\192.168.2.11 and I can see the shared folder. I can't access it because the credentials are incorrect. So I right click and go to map network drive where I then tell it to login using different credentials.
 I tell it to access it using A\itsupport with the correct password. Here are the two error messages I get after:<br />
<br />
The first is: "The network folder specified is currently mapped using a different user name and password. To connect using a different username and password, first disconnect any existing mappings to this network share"<br />
<br />
I checked and no other network drivers were mapped, so I clicked OK and then get the following: "The mapped network drive could not be created because the following error has occured: Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using
 more than one user name, are now allowed. Disconnect all pervious connections to the sever or shared resource and try again"<br />
<br />
I have no other shares on computer A so its impossible that its stuck using any other credentials.
<br />
<br />
I am very frustrated and want the ability for my workgroup computers to access the shared drive for nightly backups.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance i know it was long!

            Take a look at <span><span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938120</a>.</p>
<p>If you do NOTdo (start run \\192.168.2.11) before attempting to map the drive with alternative credentials you should be OK. A NetBT/CIFS/SMB connection is opened to browse to "A" and see the shared folders.
 That uses the credentials you logged in with on "B". Then when you tried to map the drive with the A\itsupport credential, you got a conflict. This occurs because all the connections to a given system use the same connection, but you can make the LanMan client
 think it is a different system by using a different name to do the mapping.</p>
<p>So open explorer, select Tools -&gt; Map Network Drive, enter your preferred drive letter, and the UNC path\\A\your_shared_folder, and click on "Connect using a different user name." to enter the A:\itsupport&nbsp;
 credential. Then, click finish.</p>
<p>Another workaround could be to create an account on A with the same username and password that you log onto "B" with and give it rights to the shared folder on A.</p>

<h2>            windows 8 is a resource hog</h2>
                    So i updated my Packard Bell mr/u.uk/002 to Windows 8 from Windows 7 (online download)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and it now runs slow and sluggish.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When i check the task manager (firstly it takes ages to display and the fans spin at full speed) the CPU is always around 70 to 80% with tasks like "System" being the main culprit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm pretty sure it's because the new metro desktop is always running in the background and because i'm just running on a single core celeron then multitasking is grinding everything to a halt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is anyone else having issues with massive speed reductions when moving from Windows 7 to Windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also noticed that the File Explorer (in desktop mode) is so slow. It takes noticeable seconds to display anything and if I perform any actions such as unzipping a compressed folder then the file explorer window says not responding and the whole system
 grinds to a halt for at least 10 to 15 seconds</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi thestonefox,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer
 in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on settings, more pc settings and then general.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down to advanced startup, click restart now.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on troubleshoot, advanced options, Windows Startup Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click restart, select safe mode with networking and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the
 issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the
 option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click
 ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
 right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem,
 the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program
 manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us
 to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning
 and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></b></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
 The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad
 sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

            4 years later and windows 8 is still a clunky resource hog. An operating system should let you run programs, not try to be every program. Get out of my life.

            I had the same problem. Turns out when sharing a hard drive you have to change the permissions for the drive itself too, not just the sharing permissions. Right click on the drive and select properties &gt; security [NOT sharing] &gt; edit &gt; add &gt; type in "Everyone"
 without quotes &gt; ok. Then select the "Everyone" permission in the edit dialog and tick all the permissions you want network users to have. You have to do network sharing permissions but if you don't change the drive permissions also you still won't be able
 to access it.<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
Just a follow up on a related problem. I've found that some computers on my network still ask for a username and password when connecting to a drive, and leaving it blank will result in the "you do not have permission blah blah" error. The setting that's supposed
 to change that doesn't seem to do anything on some of my systems. However, since the permissions have been set to "everyone" you just have to put
<br />
Also, my original post was in response to blaze613 about sharing drives. If you're having trouble sharing one folder presumably the same procedure applies but with the folder security settings. Don't give read/write permissions for the root of your hard drive
 to "everyone" if you just want to share one folder.<br />

<p>Hello Grim!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! Just to clarify, have you checked to see if you have an Enforcement action on your account? You can do this by going to the
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement website</a> and signing into your account. If you have an enforcement action on your account it can prevent you from sending messages, party invites and game invites. If you
 do not have an enforcement action on your account, and even if your NAT type is Open you will still want to

Troubleshoot your Network</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you still have any other questions or concerns please feel free to reply back letting us know. Thank you for again posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

            Is there a possibility you might have been comms banned? As to pertain, being comms banned will disable all of which you have said to be having issues with. Lemme know the answer and I'll keep trying to work out solutions with you!!

<p>i did have a similar issue like this not to long ago with messages and invites. I did a hard power down of my Xbox by simply holding the power button down till it turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know when you have done this correctly when you turn the console on and get the green xbox screen till it powers up the dashboard. this fixed the issue for me. If this doesn't fix your issue there might be an issue that Microsoft should be able to resolve.

<p>Hi Grim143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already tried power cycling your Xbox and modem, checked Xbox Live Status, and your not banned/suspended from enforcement&gt;&gt;&gt;have you check your privacy setting?&nbsp;

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4482922/xbox-one-online-safety-and-privacy-settings-for-parents-and-kids</a>Another solution can be removing your profile from your Xbox and readding it.&nbsp; Dont worry you will keep your saved game data and games.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Disc active 100&#37; on WIn 10 ONLY when network connected</h2>
                    <p>I am running WIn10 on a desktop PC with all updates in place and Norton Security up and running. without any installs I have the often reported problem of a 100% active disk freezing the PC. The difference in my case is it happens ONLY when I insert the
 ethernet cable OR a Wifi USB dongle OR the ethernet cable with a USB network adapter. After insert it takes 1 sec till disk usage goes up from 0-5% to 100%. When I disconnect the network it takes around 20 sec then disk usage goes down from 100 to 0-5 again.
 Network is OK as I am using wifi and ethernet with other (same WIN 10 same Norton setup) devices.
</p>
<p>I tried each and (nearly) every solution I found on the net (full Norton scan, Google-Skype issue, search disabled, superfetch disabled, startup programs reduced)</p>
<p>I thought that maybe the network adapter could cause the problem, but using the USB wifi dongle or the USB ethernet connector should be a workaround, or?</p>
<p>Any ideas out there?</p>
<p>many thanks</p>
<p>Jochen </p>

            Did exactly as you wrote. Unfortunately virtually no change. Same behaviour, only change is that it takes much longer after wifi dongle disconnect to free disk usage up (1 min instead of 20 sec). What I find strange (as an non HW guy) is that task manager
 shows 100% active disk but there is 90% of the time no read write. Somtimes some spikes of 7-9 Mbit R/W but rest of the time a flatliner.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 SP1 freezing problem.</h2>
                    Ok,so i've been having this problem for quite a time now,and at first i thought It would go away.
<div>The problem im having is that Windows 7 X64 Home Premium freezes.And no,it does not freeze randomly,and i don't get any BSOD,or any kind of error.</div>
<div>To be more specific,the only times when windows freezes are when i start my computer(right after the welcome screen goes away and the desktop appears) and when i log out of facebook(using Chrome 28).</div>
<div>-Description of the problem:Windows 7 Completely freezes,including mouse and keyboard.The freeze lasts for only 2 to 6 seconds.</div>
<div>The freezes do NOT happen randomly.</div>
<div>I want to point out that i don't have any viruses/malware/spyware/etc.(Scanned with avast 8.0.1489 and Mallwarebytes).</div>
<div>I tested the memory and the HDD for errors(Memtest and Some other software from my Hdd manufacturer).</div>
<div>And i also tryed the fixes provided by the Ms support website.(like Ms Fixit Or sfc/scannow).</div>
<div>All the drivers,including the Bios are up to date!</div>
<div>My Pc Specs are the following:</div>
<div>Os:Windows 7 Home premium x64 SP1(with the latest updates).</div>
<div>Hardware:</div>
<div>-Intel Core i3 2100@3.1 Ghz</div>
<div>-6GB of 1333 Mhz memory</div>
<div>-1TB Seagate Baracuda HDD</div>
<div>-Inter Tech Combat Power 750w Power Supply&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Nvidia Gtx 650 Ti</div>
<div>-Asus P8H61-M PRO Motherboard.</div>
<div>One last thing,I have some of the windows services disabled.(Only the services i don't actually need,like "Remote Registry"),and i don't have a lot of startup programs that can slow my Pc down.</div>
<div>I hope there is a fix for this problem,and if it's not,I want to know if i should reinstall Windows.</div>
<div>Thank you very much!</div>
                </div>

            First of all,I want to thank you for replying to my problem.<br />
I did a clean boot,and found out that the AV program was causing the hang at startup.Once i've unistalled it,the hang was gone.<br />
And the problem related to loging into facebook,it turned out it was a Google Chrome specific problem.I've installed Firefox 22 and everything is good now.<br />
Again,thank you for replying to my problem.And sorry for my bad english(im not a native english speaker).<br />

            It's been a long time since i posted this.
<div>After trying all sorts of possible fixes,it seems that somehow my computer still freezes randomly when accessing random web pages with Google Chrome.</div>
<div>Also,i've checked the even viewer and i found an error(posted below),but after checking the error,i found that "This particular Event ID 10 error message listed above can be safely ignored, this is not indicative of a problem with the Service Pack or with
 the operating system."</div>
<div>My question is why is this happening?</div>
<div>Also,i've tested both my memory and my HDD for errors,and none were found.</div>
<div>One more thing,the temps are normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Event filter with query "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage &gt; 99" could not be reactivated in namespace "//./root/CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot
 be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected.</div>

            Thanks for your response,I know my Windows 7 copy is not activated,and I'm sorry to tell you that its going to stay that way because i don't quite have the money to pay for a genuine license.<br />
Other then that,i have disabled my page file because I have 6gb of ram installed,so I don't see why I<br />
would need a pagefile anymore.<br />
But if that can solve my issue i'm ready to test it out!<br />
I've checked out all the possible forums and the official Ms website and i've seen that many people recommend that the minimum C drive partition to be at least 20GB in size(for x64).<br />
Mine is 50 gigs in size so,again i don't see why that would cause any freezes.<br />
Anyway,there are the results of the Ms Genuine Diagnostics Tool:<br />

    <title>Playing games between accounts on the same Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swankformula200  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing games between accounts on the same Xbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p><p><br /></p><p>So ive played Halo 5 since the day it came out, and ive always had two accounts i use to play it. These accounts have both been on my xbox for years and ive never had a problem switching back and forth and playing halo 5 through both accounts. The problem is I bought one copy of halo 5, and said copy belongs to this account. When i tried to switch accounts and play today, Xbox required me to purchase another copy of Halo 5. Ive never had that problem before and now cant access my second halo 5 profile without buying another copy. I know its a very specific problem, but has anybody else had this come up recently?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p>

Your second account can only play a game your main account purchased if your Xbox is set to your home Xbox. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>So, set your current Xbox to your home Xbox and it should be fine.

    <title>Keyboard Only Types Shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abbypenguin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Only Types Shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>Since about a month ago from today, my keyboard has occasionally stopped typing normally and has only used shortcuts. (For example, when I try to google something and press the 't' key, it would show me my tabs instead.) The only way to fix this problem
 is to restart the computer. The keys that aren't associated with shortcuts would still work perfectly fine. I don't have any keys stuck or any setting that would cause this to happen, and I never do anything to cause it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>My two favorite racing games are Midnight Club LA and FUEL.&nbsp; MCLA is street racing with a nice storyline and the things you can do to the cars, customizing them, is the best of any game.&nbsp; FUEL is 5,000 sq. miles of all types
 of terrain...ice, forests, desert, burnt out forests.&nbsp; It also has night and day, rain, snow, dust storms and tornadoes.&nbsp; Over 80 cars bikes, trucks.&nbsp; The tallest mountains and&nbsp;deepest valleys in any game.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the responses. &nbsp;Dirt or MCLA both looked pretty good in the reviews I was just reading. &nbsp;Any thoughts on NFS? &nbsp;I like the idea of customization and I dont want any games where its like twisted metal or anything. &nbsp;</p>

<p>MCLA is nice, and you can pick up the full game plus the South Central upgrades in a GotY package. The Game reads how often you win and lose and adjusts it's difficulty accordingly. Unless it's picked up recently, online isn't very active when I'm on. Has
 a real nice car editor. Haven't touched a NFS since Carbon. </p>

            If you like tuning cars and adjusting their performance, then the Forza Motorsport franchise would be an excellent choice. For more arcade-style open-world racing, that would be Forza Horizon 3 and 4; if you have access to Xbox Game Pass, you can try a
 number of driving titles (including FH4) as part of your subscription. EA Access, another subscription service, offers its Need for Speed franchise.

<p>I really Enjoy the Forza Series.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are looking for a Quality Racing Simulation game, then Forza Motorpsort 7 is the way to go.&nbsp; If you enjoy a more arcade type Racing with open world, then try Forza Horizon 4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of these games have great Online
 components so you can race against other players over Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also story Racers like the Need for Speed series.&nbsp; &nbsp;These give a decent story and are fun racers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Gamers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a pretty old thread, I will be closing it out. We encourage you to create a new post and keep the discussion going. We're sure many racing game fans would like to add their two cents into Midnight Club, Forza, Dirt, Project Gotham, and all the
 other amazing racing franchises out there. :)</p>

<h2>            Printing problems</h2>
                    <p>I am currently having a problem printing.</p>
<p>I cannot print to my local printer or Microsoft print to PDF.</p>
<p>When I tried to print from notepad. I get the error message"the parameter is incorrect"</p>
<p>I was getting some unusual error messages when I tried to print from Microsoft Word and Excel.</p>
<p>I don't get those error messages anymore, but nothing prints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried rebooting the computer, restarting the print spooler service, making sure there are no files stuck in the print spooler directory.</p>
<p>I have run the print troubleshooter, it did not find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why but I am able to print from Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seem to start after I've installed the latest update to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 home, version 1709, OS build 16299.64.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>parameter is incorrect</strong> is an error that usually occurs in Windows 10/8/7 and prevents you from opening the device and accessing your data. We suggest that you run CHKDSK command prompt by following the steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Plug in your external hard drive, USB drive or memory card to PC.</li><li>Open Command Prompt; then, press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> button and select the
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</li><li>In the new Command Prompt window, type <em><strong>chkdsk</strong></em><em><strong>E: /f /r</strong></em>. Here, you should replace E with the drive letter of your external hard drive or USB device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Note</strong>: This operation will run CHKDSK to check and repair file system corruption, errors, corruptions or bad sectors on the external hard drive or USB disk.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm not sure of your motherboard\sound card, but ASUS does use Soundmax as well as others...</p>

            beg your pardon...just tried a few things and i have to reply to myself.
<div>to compare ( and manage and zoom separately ) two ( or more ! ) pictures, you have to start from windows explorer</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -put it half-screen</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - get to the first picture you want to compare</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - double-click it</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the picture will now open in the "windows live photo gallery" ( if it opens full screen, bring it down to half screen, the explorer window will still be there waiting for you )</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; go back to the EXPLORER window, choose another picture, double-click it, and you have another "gallery" window ( this second gallery window may hide,even in half-screen, one of the other windows, move it, or size it at your will ).</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you can open more than two gallery windows, or a combination of gallery +paint+photoshop+etc.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the trick is to start each "opening" with windows explorer ( note you must choose a picture before you get the "open with" command: for example you can't open "my pictures" in a gallery window )</div>

    <title>black screen with blinking cursor while using win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybot  say:</h3>
<h2>            black screen with blinking cursor while using win10</h2>
                    <p>before we begin, I don't think my problem is a windows issue, as windows boots and runs fine, provided I turn off the computer after the issue happens and then adjust bios boot priorities after turning it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for the last two weeks or so, whenever I step away from my computer for a moment I come back to find a blank screen with a blinking cursor. Windows it self seems to operate just fine. but at a random period of time (longer than 10 minutes),&nbsp;after&nbsp;I get tired
 of staring at the screen to see what happens when the issue occurs, it happens. I was able to discover, that the&nbsp;black screen was the computer trying to boot from the external backup drive. which of course doesn't work as there is no boot files&nbsp;there to use.
 I&nbsp;left the usb devices unplugged today and waited for the issue to&nbsp;occur, (and tried to get win 10 to update to 14393.103). when I came back to the computer, there was a message; "Reboot and Select proper boot device or insert Boot Media in selected&nbsp; boot
 device and press any key."</p>
<p>when I did&nbsp;soft reset&nbsp;(CTRL+ALT+DEL), and entered bios setup. when I went to the bios page that listed the boot devices, only the&nbsp;bd-dvd drive was listed. the boot option for setting the HDD were actually missing. I could not get the HDD to even get detected.
 I turned off the PC and turned it back on, after entering bios setup and going to the same page, the HDD was back as an option. I set the&nbsp;boot priority back to boot&nbsp;from the HDD, and saved the changes. when the computer&nbsp;booted afterwards, win10 boot logo appeared,
 and quickly thereafter&nbsp;the logon screen appeared. I&nbsp;just had the computer in for service, and they replaced a fan which&nbsp;was dying.&nbsp;they didn't find anything else wrong, but then they were booting from a usb device loaded with their utilities, not from the
 HDD.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am at a loss as too what the issue could be. I haven't had too deal with any type of issue that wasn't software related in 10+ years, so my knowledge is a little rusty from dis-use. my issue is probably hardware based, I'm just not sure whether it's the
 HDD or the drive controller on the motherboard.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could occur due to incompatible, outdated or corrupted device drivers. You can also check if detaching all other peripheral devices except for keyboard and mouse works out the issue. The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be most likely
 related to display drivers and could be resolved by updating the drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to refer to the suggestion by <strong>Sharath Srinivatava</strong> from the following link and check.</p>

            <p>I checked out the link in your post, and that issue did not match what I am experiencing. I believe the blank screen with the blinking cursor was caused by the PC trying to boot off of the external USB drive used for backups. turning off the PC and turning
 it back on, without in plugging the the USB drive, I observed in bios setup, that the boot priorities had changed so that it was attempting to boot from the external drive. changing the priorites back to boot from the HDD got windows to load up, until the
 issue occurred again. when I let the issue occur with out any device pluged in, I see the following message "Reboot and Select proper boot device or insert Boot Media in selected&nbsp; boot device and press any key.", when the computer try's to boot to windows.
 if I go into bios setup, I find that the boot priorities have been changed once again. this time set to boot from the bd-dvd drive. setting the priorities back to boot to the HDD allows windows to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think your second link helps because windows is not loaded or attempting to load when the issue occurs. I did run through the steps anyway, and the end result was to call M$. but I know for a fact that they will refuse to help me because ASUS did
 not test the system for use with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>by blinking cursor, I mean what you might see at the dos prompt, not a mouse cursor. solving the cause of what is causing the error message and the changing in boot priorites seems to be key to solving the issue</p>

<p>
</p><p>but I am already performing the steps and getting windows to boot up all the way. it's just at some point, which conviently occurs whenever I happen to not be around, windows disappears and the computer for what ever reason gets it boot priorites changed
 because the HDD boot options are no longer available. like mabe because it's no longer to detect the HDD. but powering down the system and powering it back up, temporarily solves the HDD detection issue and windows is able to boot</p>

    <title>Windows&#39; frequency scaling gone bad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#229;rten s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows&#39; frequency scaling gone bad</h2>
                    My HP Probook with a Intel Core i5 M480 has an issue where I see 100% CPU load for 5-30minutes. There is no apparent process to blame for this, but instead it is the Windows frequency scaling that doesn't work as the CPU clock state is stuck at a low level
 for the whole period. Once I get past this state, CPU load drops from 100%, I can also see that the frequency scaling gets back on track (Indeed, the order really is this; 1) CPU load drops, and 2) scaling starts to work). The temperature is not causing this,
 but the temperature can be seen to be in the normal range of 50-55 degrees C when the problem period kicks in. The problem occurs ever so often, once or twice per day.<br />
<br />
System logs show nothing of interest. Used Open Hardware Monitor to capture what is going on. Re-installed a lot of drivers, USB etc, before 'nailing' this failing frequency scaling.<br />
<br />
So... what!?<br />

            Hi, <br />
Thanks for the reply. So;<br />
<br />
Method 1), When booting in safe more the Power settings are such that Minimum Processor state is set to 100%. And I can also confirm that it stays at this level all the time. Hence the problem where the frequency scaling get stuck at a low state cannot be reproduced.
 I could maybe change that setting and see if the problem is indeed repeatable in this mode, but as it is a bit random and usually take hours before it occurs I can't really run my work computer in safe mode during the whole day.
<br />
<br />
Method 2), Didn't have the time to go through all services. Yet. But as the computer starts up just fine and typically run well for a few hours I question if this method would really help me much.<br />
<br />
Method 3), Done.<br />
<br />
First screenshot; From the top graph on the right, and on the top bar, one can see that CPU clock is running at 44% of max frequency, while we can see from the Power Option dialog on the left we can see that the Minimum processor state should be 90% (running
 on battery), so AFAIU this setting simply is not obeyed - or?! During this time there is no CPU load problems observer, but computer is running normally.<br />
<br />
Second screenshot; The screenshots illustrates the problem situation where from the top left graph you can see that the CPU clocks get stuck at a low level, while we at the same time can see that temperatures are under control (mid graph on the left) and CPU
 load goes 100% (and frequency scaling should step in to boost up the CPU clock, but fails to do so). Also during this time the Power Settings as in previous screenshot were in use, so the minimum state should have been 90 or 100%, the power cable was in fact
 just plugged right when the problem period started, so I can't tell which rule it should have obeyed. Anyway it fails. And to me it seems like CPU clock is even lower than reported during these periods. Screenshot taken using Open Hardware Monitor.<br />

            Hi,<br />
No I haven't overclocked. <br />
<br />
I checked all the Power Plan settings surely a hundred times, but the never seemed to be obeyed. I tried running at Minimum processor state to 100% but nah - didn't work. I suspected a bad battery since it was much easier to repeat the problem when running
 on battery, I disabled the Battery ACPI-Compliant Control Method, nah - didn't solve it as I can confirm that the problem also occurred when plugged in. So all back to square one.<br />
<br />
What made the <b><u>PROBLEM SOLVED</u></b> was disabling the processor Core Parking by tweaking the registry for each Power Plan. After this everything started to work as expected. The frequency scaling ("Processor Clocking Control" seems to be the term) now
 works like a charm for all Power Plans. I can use all power plans ("HP Optimized", "Balanced", "High performance" (haven't yet tried the "Power saver" mode - not that brave yet ;-)) and the CPU clocks very nicely, very actively and without delays or logical
 surprises, ramps up and goes down according to needs. (When the problem still was with me, I could see e.g. that the Processor Management would scale down the CPU clock to the extent that CPU load would raise to 100% and the whole computer would get into a
 non-responsive state for 5-30minutes before recovering. I attach a final picture of this scenario below. You can see that the scaling goes down even if I have a rather high CPU load, and when at a low enough level the CPU load goes flat out and I get a non-responsive
 computer. )<br />
<br />
I've browsed through this document on Processor Power Management, http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/gg566941.aspx, and it seems like the Processor Power Policy algorithms are using historical performance data as input and may I speculate that
 this historical data and/or algorithms just got into a bad state on my laptop. If there is a way to reset these settings, reset all related history for these drivers, re-install drivers and starts from a clean sheet with these - I might be interested. How
 do I do that? Until then, Core Parking remains OFF on this laptop. With Core Parking OFF I have a computer that works very well.
<br />
<br />
I haven't edited anything else manually in the registry for this computer. Nor have I tweaked any bios settings on this HP ProBook 6550b. I've ran all the disk checks, virus checks, and registry cleans etc hunting down this problem - but turned up with nothing
 of interest really, so I can't tell how the Processor Power Management system did get in such a bad state. One could maybe speculate in other reasons that the Power Management settings were not what I believed they were, or other reasons why they where not
 obeyed, but ya, I dunno, after disabling the Parking all problems immediately went out the window, every change made to the settings after that has a correct and immediate impact, etc, so.. I rest my case.
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Mårten<br />

<div>I bought a new 250GB SSD drive, installed it, disconnected all other drives and am trying to install Windows 10 Pro now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Prior to this, I contacted Supermicro to verify that this board is compatible with Windows 10 and that was an affirmative from them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So today, I got the new drive installed and power up the machine, watching the Supermicro logo and BIOS post messages on my screen. Then the BD-RE drive starts to read the Windows 10 install disc and the monitor goes black. And stays black. The LED on
 the drive stopped flickering after a minute. But still no display. It has been 18 minutes now and still now display.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just to be sure, I cycled the power and put in my Windows 7 DVD and after a long period of black screen (about a minute), I get the installer window in 640x480 16 colors. So I shut down and power back up and put in the Windows 10 DVD. But this one never
 loads. I just used this install media to build two other workstations this week,&nbsp; so the media is good.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hardware is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Supermicro X10DRi motherboard</div>
<div>dual Xeon E5-2667 CPUs</div>
<div>128GB RAM</div>
<div>MSI GTX1080Ti</div>
<div>Pri display: HP LP3065</div>
<div>Sec display: LG 31MU97B</div>
<div>Boot drive (blank) Crucial 250GB SSD</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already wasted half the day on this failed attempt. Is there anything else, perhaps a BIOS setting? that I can try before I shelve this and just reinstall a new Windows 7 setup?</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi Weiss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to reset BIOS to its default settings and then check if you are able to boot from Windows 10 USB Installation Media.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.​</p>

<p>Hi Weiss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying and glad to know that you were finally able to boot from Windows 10 Installation Media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above error may occur if the Boot Sequence is not set correctly, so follow the below steps and set the Boot Sequence to boot from the Internal Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <em><a href="https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/motherboard/C606_602/MNL-1491.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">X10Dri</a></em> and check which keys that are used to boot to BIOS.</p>

</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, refer the section <strong>Boot Mode Select</strong> from the above article and set the
<strong>First Boot Device to Hard Disk</strong> and delete all other devices. Also, please make sure that no external devices are connected except the mouse and keyboard and disconnect the Ethernet cable as well if you have connected.</p>

<p>I eventually solved this two nights ago, but changing the boot option from UEFI Hard disk to UEFI Windows Boot Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some later point, I needed to boot my Windows 7 drive to get some fonts that were not installed on the new drive, so I set to Legacy Hard drive for first boot, but Windows 7 just went black screen with a row of colored pixels at the top of screen. There
 was enormous disc activity for several minutes, so I assumed it was loading and let it settle down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, Windows must have been at the desktop, so I used Windows Key then ALT-F4 and ENTER to quit blindly. At that point, the Windows 7 Welcome screen appears and I'm at the desktop in a few seconds more. What happened here??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to grab what I needed and then shut down, moved the connectors over to Windows 10 drive and change boot order to UEFI Windows Boot Image and start Windows 10. Hopefully I won't need to get into Windows 7 anymore!</p>

<h2>            the application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect...</h2>
                    I have just bought the game Age of Empires 3. I have tried to install it on my brand new HP desktop which is running Windows Vista Home Premium 64bit SP1 with no luck whatsoever.<br />
It keeps having an error that reads.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "the application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please check the event log..."<br />
<br />
I have called HP tech line to no solution.<br />
I was told that the game is incompatible with Vista. However, a friend of mine bought the same game and installed it at the same day and was able to install it<br />
in his Vista equipped laptop.&nbsp; Please help.<br />

<h2>            Some of my icons in the start menu, taskbar and folders don&#39;t have the right icons. </h2>
                    Yesturday my icons in my start menu, taskbar and folders changed. Some of them have changed to the unassociated file icon. If I open up a program folder in the satrt menu the icons are right but when I try to pin them back to the start menu or taskbar
 they go back to the unassociated look. I put&nbsp;shortcuts on the desktop they have the right icons.&nbsp;&nbsp;My "Favorites" and "Homegroup" icons on the left side folder menu have the&nbsp;unassociated icon but the subfolder icons are fine. My "Libraries" and its subfolder
 icons have the unassociated icon. My "Computer" and "Network" icons and subfolder icons are okay.
<br />
<br />
I tried taking them off the start menu and taskbar and putting them back on but still go back to the unassociated icons. when I create desktop shortcuts they use the right icons.

<blockquote>If I go on to change the icon myself, it tells that application path not found (even though clicking on the icon works fine).&nbsp; The path the link stores has %Program Files% stuff which it is unable to resolve to \Program Files (x86).<br />
</blockquote>
Is it happen to every shortcut or maybe only to the one?? If only to the one navigate in Windows Explorer to the application folder &gt; create a new shortcut from the .exe file &gt; replace with the new shortcut the old one.<br />
<br />
About the IconCache.db.... this file is unique for every single user. It's not shared. I'm wondering is it possible to replace them with another. Just login to the account which is working correctly &gt; copy the IconCache.db for example to the C:\ &gt; login to
 the old account &gt; replace the IconCache.db with that one which was copied to the C:\<br />
<br />
Another thing which you can try is to: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix a corrupted user profile</a> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> .<br />
<br />
About that <strong>%Program Files%</strong> , is it mentioned inside a path in the shortcut properties? Are you sure about that " " (space) between Program and Files? One more note: You have Windows 7 x64... so if the application was installed under Program
 Files (x86), and it's using System Path Variables it should have <strong>%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%</strong> not a
<strong>%PROGRAMFILES%</strong> <br />

<p>Hi AndyYeo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean that you want to draw diagrams using Whiteboard in Skype for business with a Wacom tablet?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an article about using the whiteboard to collaborate in a Skype for Business meeting for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-whiteboard-to-collaborate-in-a-skype-for-business-meeting-bd3d1cad-83b0-4139-bd07-c45ce94c59e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-whiteboard-to-collaborate-in-a-skype-for-business-meeting-bd3d1cad-83b0-4139-bd07-c45ce94c59e0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have some problems when using Skype for business with Wacom tablet, I recommend you contact the Wacom support teams for further help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
