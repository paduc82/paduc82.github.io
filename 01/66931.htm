<h2>            MS Comfort Keyboard 5000 User Defined Macro Keys Scan ID&#47; Code PID 02008-545-5485677-11330</h2>
                    I &nbsp;would like to take advantage of the five user defined keys on the MS Comfort 5000 keyboard. However, I cannot determine their scancode/mnemonic code.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While I could use Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse tools to point to a program to run: It would be much more efficient if I could know the keyboard scan code &nbsp;or mnemonic code &nbsp;for these five keys ( My Favorites 1-5) and the sixth key labeled "Show My Favorites"
 the Key which shows the index for these keys. If there is a list of all keys on this keyboard that would be very helpful too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am attempting to use these keys for a program I am developing, and having these keys as special functions would be quite helpful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some examples of known existing keyid/mnemonic&nbsp;</div>
<div>[<b>PHYSICAL KEY</b>] {<b>mnemonic</b>}&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows 10 reset failing to complete and PC keeps restarting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset failing to complete and PC keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G560.&nbsp; I received the free update notification to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; The update appeared to have worked OK, but after a few weeks, the PC was running slow, and I decided to reset.&nbsp; Using the Restore/Reset option I decided
 to reset the install.&nbsp; As far as I can tell the reset didn't complete and now the laptop just keeps restarting over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a> site I created a USB drive in the hopes that I could fix things.&nbsp; However when I try the Reset options, they run for a while, the percent complete increases and then it displays an error message
 that the Reset was not successful.&nbsp; If I go into the Troubleshoot options, I have tried every one of the options with none of them completing successfully either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to install Windows 10 from the USB drive it wants a product key.&nbsp; I have my Windows 7 key, but not a key for 10 because my 10 installation was via the free update method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<h2>            get windows 10 app not recognizing KB2952664 is installed</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>On my desktop running Windows 7 Pro, the Get Windows 10 App troubleshooter for checking why I don't get the upgrade icon in my windows system tray, I keep getting the error indicating that KB2952664 is not installed when it actually is. &nbsp;I have manually
 uninstalled and reinstalled KB2952664 now several times and I continue getting an error from the troubleshooter saying the KB update is not installed, even after I have restarted my system after installing the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are two versions of this file, one that does not have a system type identified with it and one for 64 bit systems, I've been installing first the KB2952664 update, then the KB2952664 for x64 systems. &nbsp;Windows update shows that both updates install
 successfuly. &nbsp;And still I continue to get the error and cannot get the system tray icon for Windows upgrade to ver 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and the system is compatible with the upgrade. &nbsp;It is an intel i7 x64 processor with 3ghz and 12 GB RAM.</p>
<p>And of course the windows 7 pro version is genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated</p>

    <title>32GB hard drive on laptop, why does free space vary so much&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kayande  say:</h3>
<h2>            32GB hard drive on laptop, why does free space vary so much&#63;</h2>
                    Sometimes there's &lt;1GB free, sometimes &gt;5GB, usually about 2.&nbsp; I have a 64 GB usb drive that I leave attached all the time, but what I don't understand is why the free space varies so much?<br />
<br />
It's an ssd hd, windows 10, about a year old.<br />
<br />
I think the Windows updates are an issue, and the latest one won't even install because there isn't enough space.&nbsp; But about 15 have installed since I bought it and I think they take up multiple GB's (~4), and I'm wondering if I should just uninstall them?<br />
<br />
I run disk cleanup regularly, and store everything I can on the usb drive, but am still trying to figure out whether it's possible to get the computer to use the usb drive more.<br />

            Hi Kristen, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question, here on Community each day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Sorry for delay. The troubleshooter could not identify the problem. I then tried to update the Driver, but Windows 10 Update&nbsp;does not recognise my Canon PIXMA MP800 multifunction printer. On the Canon site I found that the MP800 should function with&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7
 driver which I downloaded and installed as instructed for my&nbsp;64 bit PC, but to no avail. Printing is still confined to headers and ignores the content!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very frustrating as it worked perfectly&nbsp;up to&nbsp;July of this year. I even tried, &nbsp;as a temporary expedient, to restore the system to early July, only to find that Windows 10 has not been backing up my files etc. Yet another problem which I
 don' t understand, but that is for another day. I wish now that I had stayed with Windows 7.....Is there something else I can try to get the printer working?</p>

<p>Tried again as recommended, including downloading the latest Canon drivers for Windows 7 and Vista, but neither were successful. With no success from both Windows Update and driver update, I tried Troubleshoot Compatibility. I tested each driver setup file
 several times without success. I don't know where to go from here.</p>
<p>Incidentally, troubleshooting the printer in Windows 10 could not find a problem, but in the Control Panel "&nbsp;Devices and Printers " troubleshooting the printer suggested the problem is "USB composite device can't work properly with USB3.0". Well, it did
 work in July and I don't have USB2 which may suggest some change in Windows 10 has interfered with the printer. I am now closer to reverting to Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop Refreshes, Windows Explorer Closes, Constant</h2>
                    I just updated to Windows 10 and I'm experiencing the Desktop Refresh/Reload issue. I don't have the iCloud on my machine which appears to be the general consensus of the problem. I also disabled One-Drive on my machine which was another program thought
 to cause the issue. Anyone know of anything else that may be doing it? starting to get annoying as it closes screens and items that I'm using. Its also fairly random. Sometimes taking a whole minute to happen others taking 20-30secs between.

            No dice. Still does the refresh reload thing. I decided to go ahead and try to do a clean install now that I've fully upgraded. I downloaded the media creation tool. My computer Windows 8.1 upgraded to Windows 10 Professional so I created a USB stick to
 install from. my Asus mother board doesn't give me the option to boot from USB so I tried just double clicking on setup on the USB drive it opens, does a check for updates and then asks for a product Key. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 using the free upgrade
 so I don't have a product Key and there is no option to skip. What should I do now?

            <p>BTW... I may have fixed the desktop reloading problem (I'd still like to know how to perform a clean install though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be an issues with these two services running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support</p>
<p>Windows Error Reporting Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon disabling these services and preventing them from running on startup through msconfig the reloading completely stopped. I like the fact that the solution was simple, I don't like the fact its two services for the OS to help prevent/report errors. I
 actually don't like that my computer won't properly report errors now (as someone with a relative in network security, disabling error reporting makes me cringe). May want to take a look into these services and see what the compatibility might be with them
 and people upgrading&nbsp;from Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Ellen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What scan?  There are at least fifty kinds of scans you can do.  
<br />
<br />Is this to check for a virus or infection?  If so Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Problem installing game purchased in microsoft store error Code&#58; 0x87E10BCF</h2>
                    I recently purchased Sea of thieves through the store and whenever I try to start the download it attempts to acquire licence and says It couldn't install and will try again shortly. I bought windows 10 for the sole reason of playing this game and have
 tried a plethora of means to fix it short of completely wiping and reformatting my computer. Everything is up to date as far as i can tell and I'm not sure where to go at this point.

 for your help so far and at the moment I'm not using an anti virus i do have ccleaner though. I recently updated from windows 8.1 last night and used the regular prompted install. I'm feeling like i might need to reformat and start off fresh at this point.</p>

<p>on my lg e973 I get an error in event viewer some blog&nbsp;says related to visual c++ 2010 install missing not sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not running an amd processor but an intel Pentium&nbsp;core 2 duo&nbsp;processor e8200&nbsp;on my computer per control panel and I have a NVidia GeForce 200 series video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the program lg pc suite&nbsp;here is the error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation context generation failed for "C:\Program Files (x86)\LG Electronics\LG PC Suite\LGPCSuite.exe".Error in manifest or policy file "" on line . A component version required by the application conflicts with another component version already active.
 Conflicting components are:. Component 1: C:\Windows\WinSxS\manifests\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.7601.17514_none_41e6975e2bd6f2b2.manifest. Component 2: C:\Windows\WinSxS\manifests\amd64_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.7601.17514_none_fa396087175ac9ac.manifest.</p>
<p>In component 2 there is a amd64 related item on the manifest what could it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this is relevant but I am using windows 7 64 bit home premium ROW version</p>
<p>that is rest of world version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi I did further investigation with sxstrace unfortunately i am not a specialist with microsoft so please anyone who has any idea here is output of sxstrace.txt on a clean install of windows 7 no updates</p>

<p>Hi Edgar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these drivers do have the yellow triangular error next to them. Will try to uninstall each driver and restart again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version 1809</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will update after the uninstall and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT</p>
<p>After the restart I don't have any yellow rectangular errors any more.</p>
<p>Althoug I still ave 2 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Their are 6&nbsp;<span>Intel(R) Dynamic Platform and Therma Framework Generic Participant
</span>drivers installed for the moment. Is this ok?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2)&nbsp;</span> <span>Surface Base 2 Firmware Update </span>
is not installed anymore. Again, also ok?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help.</p>

 You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by <strong>
performing a clean boot.</strong></p>

<h2>            Microsoft 10 upgrade killing power on my pc</h2>
                    <p>My Gateway (NV52L23u) laptop with Windows 10 is receiving an upgrade for Win10 automatically because it says I need it to receive security updates.&nbsp; All processes apparently go through till it gets to the installing stage for upgrade.&nbsp; It takes quite awhile
 so I don't sit here and watch it progress but somewhere around 90-100% complete my laptop just shuts off and all upgrade is lost.&nbsp; I had something similar while trying to download videos and guessed it was my cpu overtaxed but never verified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; This goes on daily cause I can't stop the upgrade.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update might be lost if the laptop loses power while the update installation is not yet finished. Let's check first if the update was installed. Run the Check for updates options once more to see if there are no pending updates. To do that, follow the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Settings.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security.</strong></li><li>On the left panel, select <strong>Windows Update.</strong></li><li>Under Windows Update, click the <strong>Check for updat</strong><strong>es</strong> option.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no pending updates, then it was successfully installed. If there's a pending one, install it again. Make sure not to lose power supply while the update is installing. You can also temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows
 10 and install it a later time. Click this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know how to temporarily
 prevent a Windows Update.</p>

<p>Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for offering help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not killing power to my laptop while download is occurring...it is the download and install itself that is shutting off my laptop and I need to figure out how to stop that from happening.&nbsp; Until I can I also need to know how to stop the upgrade from
 occurring so I can fix the issue.&nbsp; Every time I repower my laptop from the unforeseen loss of power the first thing it does is go right back to trying to download and install up grade.&nbsp; I want that to stop!&nbsp; My current windows 10 version is 1607 and I am guessing
 it is trying to put in Fall Creators Update or possibly the one before that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. You can temporarily prevent the update from installing by following the steps in this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10.</a>
</strong>However, it is only temporary.Updates are still needed to be installed at a later time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for power losses while update is installing, this might be caused by a corrupted system or update file. Try installing the update manually through our
<strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong>. Just type the KB update on the search bar you want to install and select the one you want to download and install from
 the list of updates. </p>

<p>Hello, I need some help. Lately my computer has translated other languages such as Japanese or Korean into square boxes lately, and I'm wondering why is that. I've updated Java, and any updates that were needed, tried a system restore back to the point where
 it was working,&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;the patches, but I'm still stuck. &nbsp;Can someone tell me why I'm having this problem? I never used to have it before, and it only started happening a couple of weeks ago too.&nbsp;</p>

            Tried it and didn't work, and no I didn't download a converter. Thing is, the computer was able to translate it before. I've had this laptop for a year, no real changes or anything, but suddenly it just starts translating into squares. Last Friday, it
 started to translate Korean out of nowhere, but this Monday it suddenly stops. It's like a on and off translation or something..&nbsp;

It says it already have the language packs installed, as well as service pack 1. I still have the same problem, and occasionally it comes back to being normal, translating korean on websites I visit frequently, but then just turns up as squares another day.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Ahmet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some tips for making your xbox "my home".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Designate an Xbox One console as your home Xbox
<div style="margin-left: 0; color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;&nbsp;to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Personalization</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>My home Xbox</strong>.</li><li>Do either of the following:
<ul>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Make this my home Xbox</strong>&nbsp;to designate the console as your home Xbox.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Remove this as my home Xbox</strong>&nbsp;to remove the designation.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>When you change home consoles, all device licenses for digital content will move to your new home Xbox. These device licenses will no longer be available on your previous home Xbox. In other words, when you switch
 your home Xbox, access to your content comes with you to your new home Xbox, and anyone signed in can enjoy it. Your previous home Xbox will still give your friends and family access to your stuff when youre signed in to it.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div>
Can I change my home Xbox console to a different console?
<div style="margin-left: 0; color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>You can change which console is your home Xbox up to five times during a one-year period. This period works on a rolling basis, starting the moment you switch your home Xbox for the first time. If you reach your
 limit of home console switches for the year, youll get a message letting you know the next available date you can change it.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;Customer support cannot offer additional switches. If your console shows youve made five home Xbox switches for the year and you need assistance, select&nbsp;<strong>Help</strong>&nbsp;when you see
 the message,&nbsp;<strong>Cant make this your home Xbox</strong>. You may be eligible to receive an exception.</p>
<p>You can also get help with your home Xbox in Xbox Assist. Press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;&nbsp;to
 open the guide, select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Assist</strong>, choose&nbsp;<strong>My Xbox Assist</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>, and then enter&nbsp;<strong>My Home Xbox</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you have encountered these while trying to change consoles and let us know the results.</p>

<p>Hello Ahmet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We&nbsp;need a little more information to&nbsp;ensure that we provide the correct solution.&nbsp;Are those consoles connected to the same network? Are you experiencing any issues with connecting to Xbox Live? We suggest
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
testing the network and multiplayer connections </a>in the network settings of the console. Do any error messages appear? The reason we recommend this step is because the console must have a stable connection to Xbox Live in order to establish your account
 as the home console profile. If both consoles were connected to the same network, the issue may be with the connection to Xbox Live. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>
        </p>

            Well, both consoles are NOT connected to the same network. They both connect to the internet correctly. Their both NAT types are Open. But still, I cannot make any of them home xbox with my account.

<h3> grickm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1803 update caused system image creation to fail</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated an older system to Windows 10 1803. The update caused the 450 MB Recovery Partition to end up with 431 MB used. Since the volume shadow copy function requires at least 50 MB free space on this partition, the system image creation tool
 to failed with error 0x80780119, insufficient storage to create a volume shadow copy. Since disk management GUI offers no access to the recovery partition, I had to use diskpart to assign a drive letter to verify that the partition was too full. I then used
 disk management to shrink my C: partition by 100 MB, then a 3rd party tool, because disk management only expands to its right, to expand the recovery partition into the 100 MB that was freed up. The disk layout is [system][c: (Windows 10)][recovery partition][d:]</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the resized recovery partition system image creation proceeded as expected.

            Thanks for posting this, I tried scanning, fixing and a few other options recommended in Dell/Microsoft forums following a Windows 10 reset that stopped my image back up running.&nbsp; However the fact volume shadow copy function requires at least 50 MB free
 space was my problem!&nbsp; Thanks again, Peter

            Hi,  MatejPe
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps:
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />If this does not work, you can try to update manually 
<br />

<p>Thanks for your answer !</p>
<p>I figured out, just shortly after your reply</p>
<p>While automatic update still didn't work i have tried with manual update, suggested by your link.</p>
<p>After trying to install update, i was getting error , that windows update isn't ready cause of hardware error.</p>
<p>Then i realized that i have USB stick connected to my computer, so i removed USB stick , then update was just fine</p>
<p>and everything works now !</p>
<p>

<h3> jennifer821  say:</h3>
<h2>            trying to install movie maker but it says I already have it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my pc runs on windows 7 and I am having trouble installing windows live essentials.
</p>
<p>When I open up the installer it tells me photo gallery &amp; movie maker is avaliable for update, after running the update,&nbsp; I can't find movie maker when making a search for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-wlinstall/unable-to-install-windows-live-movie-maker-says-i/7955db72-4131-462b-beb4-8e785fc51797?auth=1">
this</a> but it didn't work (also no windows live folders were found in program files)
</p>
<p>I also tried using Revoun uninstaller (sugguested on another post) to uninstall again and remove any extra files, it cleared off some windows live files, and I tried installing windows live essentials again, but still no good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anyone have any other suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! </p>
