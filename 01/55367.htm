<h2>            DHCP Event 1041, 10020 DHCP completely broken on 2012 R1</h2>
                    <p>The event text in questions:&nbsp; The DHCP service is not servicing any DHCPv4 clients because none of the active network interfaces have statically configured IPv4 addresses, or there are no active interfaces 2012 R1</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had some updates this weekend, and since then all of my 2012 R1 (Curse this wretched OS) servers can't seem to successfully run DHCP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the IP address in the bindings menu , and check it off, but Apply remains grayed out, and hitting OK doesn't seem to make the change.&nbsp; I verified that all the NICs in question have static IP4 addresses.&nbsp; I've tried this on 3 servers, one a VM,
 one a hypervisor, and one without Hyper-v and all have the same behavior.&nbsp; I'm running out of servers to attempt to run DHCP on, and my leases are going to start expiring soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change DHCP NIC bindings in the registry, or to hardcode them otherwise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other poor saps stuck running 2012 R1 having this same issue?</p>

            <p>Found the fix, posting it here since it's not documented anywhere else online.&nbsp; The cause of the issue was that we had disabled IGMP in the registry, per one of our auditor's recommendations.&nbsp; The registry key in question is HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\IGMPLevel.&nbsp;
 DHCP will not start if it's set to 0, so I changed it back to 2 (the default value)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why something like Multicast would prevent DHCP server service from binding to a NIC, but there we are...</p>

            Put the CD that came with your printer into the DVD drive of your computer to install the software. The CD will fit in your computers DVD drive - they are all the same size. Don't use a printer CD tray when putting a CD into the computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
See this image for inserting the CD:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1607 wiped out boot mbr, can&#39;t boot. How to restore.</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual boot system with Win10 and Ubuntu 16.10 . <br />
Windows 10 performed an update and restarted. Upon restart my grub boot loader was wiped out by windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are two things I tried:<br />
I thought to restore grub - but can't as windows is in a "hibernation" mode.&nbsp;<br />
I I thought to boot from my Windows 10 installation media but it claims it appears windows 10 is in the middle of an update and I can click yes to continue update(which does not&nbsp;continue it - it just exits)&nbsp;or cancel to perform a clean install.<br />
<br />
What can I do to get around this - I can boot into Linux using a boot disk, I can not boot into Windows 10 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I repair the boot sector so I can boot into windows&nbsp;v 10?<br />

            My Windows 10 install media comes up with <br />
"it appears windows 10 is in the middle of an update"&nbsp;... "click yes to continue update(which does not&nbsp;continue it - it just exits)&nbsp;or cancel to perform a clean install."<br />
<br />
So how do I get to the command prompt from those two choices. Or when the DVD is booting is there a special key combination I can do to get the command prompt ?

            <p>Win 10 is supposed to go into Recovery mode if there have been three boot tries that fail.&nbsp; If the system thinks it is normal, maybe it won't go there by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you are being given only&nbsp;two choices.&nbsp; You say one just restarts and tries to continue the update install, but you haven't tried the other one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also be reluctant to choose the clean install since I am not sure what it will do.&nbsp; But I
<em>expect</em> it will put you into the clean install options, from which you can open a command prompt with Shift+F10 or will have the Repair your computer option on the second page...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whatever, if you are asked where to install, exit out and don't change any partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have not encountered this situation, I cannot guarantee something won't go wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can confirm you system was installed in the Legacy configuration?&nbsp; How your system will respond to certain commands will depend on how you installed Ubuntu.&nbsp; If the commands referenced do not help, there are a couple of others we can try.</p>

            <p>The two suggestions I could come up aren't really optimum:</p>
<p>- continue into the next screen of the "clean install" and see if there's a "Repair My Computer" option there.</p>
<p>- use Linux to erase hiberfil.sys from C:\ which should let grub be reinstalled.</p>

In your comments:<br />
"&nbsp;You say one just restarts and tries to continue the update install" - No I said it exits .. and I am back to the same place. I am not sure if it actually restarted the pc or just exited.
<br />
<br />
</p>
&nbsp;Yes the clean install scares the day lights out of me - because I do not want the installer to just go to town and assume to wipe everything with out any further input from me. After all here it is, it did its 1607 update and did not care about my boot record
 and messed it up - so no telling if the programmer was concerned about my system.

            <p>Thanks Rick</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the chance on the installation and the first screen I had my doubts - but it was at least asking me a question, so I clicked next and on the second screen bottom left hand corner I had the option to go into recovery mode.
<br />
I used the commands you provided , not sure if scanos was needed as rebuildbcd shows the OS's as well .. (not sure what else that does}.
<br />
<br />
The OS it found was windows.old (I guess that is what it does when updating.)<br />
This has fixed the boot issue and it is now updating. Why windows writes over my boot record when it does this stuff bothers the daylights out of me.

<p>I tossed in /scanos just in case it was going to rebuild with one.&nbsp; I have similar problems with a 7/10 dual boot.&nbsp; The "windows.old" thing you mention might give a clue as to why it's editing the bootloader, but not why it gets messed up.</p>

<p>I would run the System File Checker program. &nbsp;Take these steps:</p>
<p>1 - Uninstall all components of Windows Live from your computer. &nbsp;We want to get a clean start.</p>
<p>2 - Reboot your computer, since some of the removal may wait until the next start.</p>
<p>3 - Open an elevated command prompt (<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/783-elevated-command-prompt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how?</a>) and type this command: &nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">more information about the SFC command</a>)</p>
<p>4 - When it is done, reboot the computer completely once more so that any repaired files are restored to use</p>
<p>5 - Go to the <a href="http://get.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live webpage</a> to re-download the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the outcome. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            Hi,
<br />General troubleshooting tips:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10587/windows-10-get-help-with-upgrade-installation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10587/...</a>
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.

<br />You can use any file sharing website to send the files to me.

<h2>            The application failed to initialize properly &#40;0xc0150002&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi my name is Kenya Caldwell and I am currently running windows vista home premium.&nbsp; For about 3 months I've been getting the same error message when ever I open this program called Autocad, the application failed to initialize properly (0xc015002).&nbsp; I have
 tried reinstalling the program, but the program&nbsp;still doesn't work.&nbsp; I read the fourms and I may have found the answer, but I am not sure it applies to my case.&nbsp; I will list&nbsp;the message below.</p>
<p>From Lorien-One</p>
<p>Corrupt system files (which you discovered with SFC) must either be replaced individually or you must do a system repair/upgrade<span>using the genuine Windows Vista
 Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to analyze&nbsp;the SFC's CBS.LOG&nbsp;to find the problem file(s) using
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files that couldn't be corrected here (with the information about them) so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).&nbsp; Do you have or have access somehow to a genuine
 Vista Installation Disk?</span></span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<hr />
If this is correct, could some one help me with the slip stream disk part since it may be tough?

<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Kenya Caldwell</p>

<h3> arturozo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP machine won&#39;t print over home wireless network to printer on Win7 machine.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've got a Windows 7 64-bit machine with a Brother HL-1440 printer attached to it via USB. I've also got an XP Home Edition laptop, and I'd like to be able to print over my home wireless connection to the 1440. I used to be able to do this when I was printing
 from this laptop to the same printer on an XP Professional machine.<br />
<br />
But now, even though I can see the printer fine on the network, and all other aspects of the home network are working fine, I can't set the laptop to print through the Win7's printer. I get stopped dead in my tracks by an inability to get the proper driver
 for the XP machine. It won't install the driver from the local machine, and it won't install the driver from the Win7 machine where I've created a directory with the XP version of the 1440 driver.
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes, I can download the driver to the XP and install the printer locally, but when I go to connect to the Brother attached to the Win7, I get told the server doesn't have the right drivers, and it won't accept the drivers I've just downloaded locally (it rejects
 them after I click on the .inf file). It's the darndest thing...

            I've manually installed the driver to no avail - even when I attached the printer directly to my win7 64 computer.&nbsp; I finally worked around the issue by using XP mode with a 32 bit driver, which is a pretty heavy-weight workaround...&nbsp; I've got a lot of
 years experience with this stuff, and it seems to me that that the issue is with the 64 bit driver interaction when installing the driver locally and with trying to install a 64 bit driver from an XP 32 bit machine when accessing the printer over a network.

<br />
Probably is a 32/64 bit driver issue.&nbsp; Does Brother make a&nbsp;64-bit driver for the unit?

<h2>            Can&#8217;t get to safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi so my problem began when i decided to update a driver for my laptop. Turned out to be a wrong one because when i restarted i got stucked into a blue screen of death loop and everytime it restarts it goes back to blue screen. I figure that if i go to safe
 mode and uninstall the faulty driver it shouls go back to normal. However i can’t. Now i’ve installed a windows iso on a usb flash drive. But i dont get any start up options to reach safe mode. I have only the command prompt but now when i try to run the bcdedit
 line it doesnt work. So i cant do that now either.</p>
<p>I feel like im running out of options here. I would really appreciate the help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Enrique.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you try System Restore from the Advanced Troubleshoot Options?  
<br />
<br />You said you tried the bcdedit command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options?  Check the command here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails did you try the onboard Advanced Startup Options to try to get to Startup Settings, by whichever method works here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> ?
<br />
<br />If those also don't work then you can try uninstalling the driver from Command Prompt using DISM:  <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/617868/uninstall-offline-windows-os-drivers-with-dism-command/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/61786...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then I'd do the Reset from Troubleshoot Options on booted media, or you can use the same media to do the superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            My PC freezes and i need to do hard shutdown&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 months ago i bought a PC. After 2 weeks it started to freeze , i was waiting for about an hour, but it was still not responding. It makes sometimes a buzzing sounds. So i tried to reinstall my windows and it still freezes , im sure its HW problem. I can
 still do a BIOS update , but i dont know if it fixes or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc is still under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- RAM test (whole night)</p>
<p>- HDD test (CrystalDiskInfo ... s.m.a.r.t)</p>
<p>- Windows reinstall</p>
<p>- I think all my drivers are up to date</p>
<p>- IGPU test (i was running on it for about an hour)</p>
<p>- Temps are good...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But i found a problem , my ssd isn´t seen sometimes by CrystalDiskInfo or it shows that my ssd is dying.&nbsp;</p>

                    I upgraded to the i7 platform today and started with a fresh installation of windows 7, however I also kept my 2 old hard drives Drive 0 (Hitatchi 250 GB) Drive 1 (Hitatchi 500 GB) Drive 2 (Seagate 1 TB) - the 1 TB HDD is the new one. However, the BIOS
 recognizes all the drives, Windows 7 doesnt Recognize the 1TB HDD.... Disk Management Doesn't either. Any Suggestions? I want to Be able to use said drive as I have information on the 500 but it's 90% full.... (Pulling my hair out trying to find a way for
 this drive to be seen by windows 7.) <br />
<br />
Intel LGA 1156 MB<br />
4GB DDR3 1066 RAM<br />
Intel i7 2.8GHz<br />
MSI NVIDIA 250 GTS 512 MB Video.

            I managed to solve the problem. I had the EXACT same problem and was able to troubleshoot this down to a bug in Windows 7.<br />

<br />
<br />
I made a blog post about this issue in which I linked above. However, I will also provide the workaround here:<br />
<br />
<strong>The Answer: </strong><br />
Start -&gt; Right Click Computer -&gt; Properties<br />
Device Manager (on left side)<br />
Click the Disk Drives arrow to show the list<br />
Find Your Drive You Installed Here<br />
Right Click on the Drive -&gt; Uninstall<br />
After the SATA HDD disappears, click the Action menu -&gt; Scan For Hardware Changes

    <title>Re-enabling Secure Boot Control on Surface Pro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-enabling Secure Boot Control on Surface Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>I have an original Surface Pro that I recently reinstalled a clean copy of Windows 10 Pro to from a USB key. &nbsp;In order to be able to boot to the USB drive, I disabled the "Secure Boot Control" within the firmware as directed. &nbsp;Upon the completion of installing
 Windows 10 (he install landed on the original 109GB partition after deleting/reformatting the original), I attempted to re-enable secure boot control and install the default boot keys. &nbsp;After saving and exiting, the machine will boot into Windows fine... until
 I reboot. &nbsp;At that point it will launch into diagnostic/repair mode and eventually report that it can't load Windows. &nbsp;My only recourse is to disable Secure Boot Control again and then Windows loads fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every conceivable combination of deleting keys, disabling/enabling boot control, etc., and keep experiencing the same behavior. I'm showing version 2.15.1226 of the firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on how I can reliably re-enable secure boot control and be able to load Windows as expected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br />
Ken</p>

            <p><span>Hello Kschram,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One thing I’d like to check ahead of all things is if you search for updates to your Surface, is there anything available?</span></p>
<p><span>You may have to re</span><span>start the Surface 2-3 times before they start showing up but this may be the quickest
 way to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do note that there have been users experiencing issues after performing a clean install with the Windows 10 image&nbsp;rather than using the Windows 8/8.1 recovery image for Surface&nbsp;available
 on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This may mean that you will need to reinstall the device with the recovery image for Surface rather than the Windows 10 image.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep me updated on the case.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With kind regards</span></p>

            Thank you for the feedback. &nbsp;I ended up pulling the plug on the clean install idea and performed a full restore of my previously upgraded environment.

<h2>            Lost all inbox emails from Outlook&#47;Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using hotmail on my iphone 5 (version 9.2.1) (using Apple Mail) and through google chrome - by going to www.hotmail.com to login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last day I have noticed all my emails from my Inbox have disappeared (both from phone) and when I login online through www.hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked deleted items and recovered what I could - there is nothing here but some junk I had deleted</p>
<p>I have checked some of my personal folders and old historic emails are sitting here. So it appears just an inbox error&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to contact anyone at Windows, well as soon as I mention the problem the live chat is closed down instantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled online for fixes but only come across help for gmail accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice that would be appreciated - I have many important emails that have now disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anna&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If you are using a Microsoft email address your account is probably being migrated to the new email format called outlook mail.&nbsp; It can take up to 48 hours to complete and you data may return when complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you run the backup that Microsoft suggested when you signed up for the email address?&nbsp; If your mail does not return
<span><span>Unless you made the back up that Microsoft recommended when you signed up for the email address, the data is gone because, like you, the online servers are not backed up</span></span>

            <p>Hi sorry I'm not so tech savvy so words may not be correct:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have had had a hotmail account for over 15+ years, I noticed year (s) ago it mergered with Microsoft and often when I sign in (I always use www.hotmail.com) to sign in, that it's now called outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have my emails merged into my mail on my iPhone, I haven't changed anything or seen a notice to back up emails?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping anyone can give me advice. None of the emails are sitting in deleted emails, everything literally disappeared overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you you to any advice</p>

    <title>How long have you had your XBL account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devgod  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long have you had your XBL account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Last week when I called into Xbox Support regarding DLC billing issue on my Xbox One, I was informed that my account turned 11yrs old on that day (12/12). Needless to say the rep was in awe that I had the same gamertag for 11yrs. After clearing up my DLC
 issue (a refund) I was given 3 awesome "account birthday" / sorry for your trouble gifts. 12mon xbox live (bday gift) and I was allowed to keep the DLC for my billing/acct troubles plus 1mon extra XBL.</p>
<p>This is why I love Xbox Live and Support. They went far beyond what was expected (I just wanted my card credited back and to use the XBL acct credit instead). Now they have a loyal member or life. It now&nbsp;my goal to have the oldest xbl account ever &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>You might have to go to the manufacturers website and download the appropriate drivers for your model laptop.
</p>
<p>Also, you might have to reactivate by telephone:</p>

    <title>Norton Disk Doctor stopping computer from booting up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fromage123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Norton Disk Doctor stopping computer from booting up</h2>
                    <p>So my dad tried using Norton Utilities to optimise the computer and after running some things it then said that it needed to repair the disk. It asked him to restart the computer and then when the computer came back on again the disk doctor was running but
 Windows says there is an error when trying to boot up- stopcode: Critical process died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then goes into a loop of trying to restart (automatic repair) but Windows won't boot up. There are some advanced options on automatic repair and we have tried all of them but the disk doctor thing keeps loading before all of them causing the error- can't
 even start in safe-mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried somethings with the command prompt, like 'sfc scannow' which got to 100% but said there was an error and 'chkdsk' couldn't even &nbsp;begin, but i don't know how to use it and I don't know any other ways to start up the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we're on windows 10 there is no like disk we can use to try and reload Windows from too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: managed to start a system restore, and it finished but then it restarted the computer again and the Disk Doctor is still running- how do it stop it from running?</p>

This is typically the result of trash talking over the mic or sending profane Xbox messages to others.
