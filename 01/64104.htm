    <title>How to upgrade to Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silly_dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to upgrade to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It is a very dumb question isn't it? Especially if it comes from a senior software architect and team lead, who has been designing &nbsp;intuitive user interface for a decade. I am good, but obviously, not good enough to be a normal user of Microsoft's rocket
 science user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google "how to upgrade to windows 10". Maybe the mistake is made here. I should have used Bing???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this page: &nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/windows-10-upgrade</p>
<p>It has two buttons: "upgrade now" or "shop now" for buying a new PC. Obviously I should click "upgrade now".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It downloaded "GetWindows10-Web_Default_Attr.exe" to my PC. I clicked it, and clicked "Run".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It opened a new web page:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/default.aspx</p>
<p>It contains following buttons:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;"Learn more" - it leads to "compare Windows 10 editions" page.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;"Get started" - it downloads the "Windows10Business_Readiness_Kit.zip" file.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;"Upgrade" for small and medium business - it goes back to the previous page&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;"Get started" for enterprise business - it leads to "buy" page.</p>
<p>5. "Begin now" to begin a training course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None leads to actually upgrading my Windows 7 to Windows 10!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked to a colleague - he was a very bright engineer and our IT support. He said he also tried to upgrade to Windows 10, and he got lost in the maze and gave up. Just like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is one the major products you Microsoft want to sell, and you created a maze, it is so tricky and trapping that people with a brain power that is not far above me can't find a way out and don't know what's going on. Why????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago at work I used Windows backup to backup a test machine which is very important. After some testing, today I wanted to restore the backup, and found that the Windows restore facility simply doesn't recognize the files created by the Windows
 backup facility! Jesus Christ!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you have long lost lost your conviction haven't you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have given up long time ago haven't you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are so big and bureaucratic that you are like a big carcass lying there waiting for nimble competitors to start their feast on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did I want to upgrade to Windows 10? Because after the recent Windows Update half of my programs no longer run!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Google one day releases an operating system, that's will be the end of Microsoft. I can't wait for that day to come.</p>

            What is the hurry? With Microsoft constantly being so arrogant (like taking away the "Start" button in Windows 8) and presenting so appalling quality (like presenting a maze to trap users who want to upgrade to Windows 10, like your own restore facility
 can't recognize the file produced by your own backup facility), sooner or later someone with an appetite big enough to feast on this big carcass will show up. It is just a matter of time.

            <p>Hi thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the troubleshooter it detected nothing, and as for the mouse settings I want it to be always on left but it keeps switching back to right and i keep turning it back to left and as soon as i close the settings menu it turns back to right just
 for me to repeat everything until it stops doing so.</p>

    <title>After a few hours of use, a new Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lloydmalvern  say:</h3>
<h2>            After a few hours of use, a new Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 developed latency and then bit the dust as I was using it&#59; lights are still flashing</h2>
                    <p>The lights are still flashing. Red. Green. Red. Green. Red Green.</p>
<p>But the mouse cursor is frozen on the screen.</p>
<p>I rebooted.</p>
<p>Mouse still not working.</p>
<p>Tried to discover it again. No success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is right beside me on the desk. Mouse is about 36 inches from the bluetooth radio on the PC's motherboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought it yesterday. It worked for a day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power management was set to not let the PC turn the&nbsp;mouse off and the mouse was able to wake the computer from sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the third wireless mouse from Microsoft (the other two were Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 with dongle) that eventually stopped working on this PC, which is running Windows 7 x64. They all died the same way -- they got slow and laggy and then stopped
 working altogether.</p>

<h2>            Cortana reminders not working</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10 Pro.. Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.693) for my desktop. Cortana will accept reminders, but not trigger them at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even simple stuff like "remind me to make a call in one minute" will not result in a popup ... but it is listed in reminders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these reminders that I enter on my desktop show up on my cellphone after the fact as a notification, but over the past week or two, not on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Disconnecting an FTP Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artcharbonneau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnecting an FTP Server</h2>
                    <p>Somehow an FTP Server has appeared in File Explorer (Windows 10 Home Pro), under "This PC", somewhat like a mapped drive. It's address is "ftp://192.168.1.70:2121". I'm the only one who uses this laptop, and I have no idea why this ftp server appeared. It
 might have something to do with my Seagate Central Home Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right-click on it, there is no 'Disconnect' option, but there is a 'Delete' option... &nbsp;which I do not want to use lest it's pointing to some important files on my Seagate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how I get rid of this unwanted entry in File Explorer would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Tonya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When upgrading to a new operating system, OS, some drivers be incompatible with the new OS. &nbsp;A drive is like a translator between a piece of hardware and the software of the computer. &nbsp;It allows the two to communicate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon has already come out with new updated drivers for its printers for windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest plugging in your printer to your computer instead of over wifi when you do this step. &nbsp;You will prob need a USB 2.0 Type A to Type B cable to do this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to Canon's Website&nbsp;http://usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mg_series</p>
<p>and you should be able to track down your printer model, or the closest to it possible, and download the new windows 10 driver. &nbsp;There are two versions for windows 10: x86 and 64 bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to this website to find out how to find out if your computer is 32 bit (x86) or 64 bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows#1TC=windows-7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Bobby Baker</p>

            Okay did that and it said it installed the driver, but it still will not work. I even tried the buttons on the printer instead of the canon menu and it said the same thing. It did, however let me print from the buttons. I need to scan lol<br />

            <p>Ok thanks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the fact it is printing and not scanning it seems like there is more than one program that is responsible for communicating with the printer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be difficult to try to find that one or two programs and run them in compatibility mode. &nbsp;So I would suggest contacting Canon at this website. &nbsp;They may be able to write you a custom program that will help with the incompatibility. &nbsp; http://usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mg_series/pixma_mg3220/form_display/support_by_kb_email</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a different Canon scanner model and&nbsp;configure with IJ Scan Utility, by default when scanning using the MG3200 series control panel it sends a request to execute&nbsp;IJ Scan to process and save the scanned image to the nominated folder (default value is
 Document folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test, as&nbsp;I already have Admin permission,&nbsp;if I change the security permission for Documents folder to Deny Read &amp; Execute/Read/Write/List Folder Contents and tried to initiate a scan from the scanner (by pressing the button) it comes up with 'Code: 9,244,3
 You do not have the required privileges to access the specified folder'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible with the symptoms that you currently have may be related to Access Permission&nbsp;for the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3f78775-a175-49ea-a277-862b88fdf859" height="243" width="359" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that you can try is create a new folder where the scanned image will&nbsp;be saved&nbsp;and check the permission</p>

            <p>Good to hear that you can scan using the printer control panel.&nbsp; Using the MG3200 button to push scan triggers an event to request the OS to open IJ Scan.&nbsp; For testing, not sure if you have tried scanning using WIA to check if you can acquire using the computer
 = open Devices &amp; Printer &gt; right click the printer icon &gt; in the list of option click Start Scan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scanning from computer using IJ Scan and in the Canon site it has this My Image Garden, both use TWAIN&nbsp;to acquire or scan and&nbsp;is a&nbsp;Canon proprietary software, may be it is unable to detect that the correct MG3200 driver (printer &amp; scanner) is installed</p>

I had the same problem when upgrading to windows 10, went searching internet, microsoft site (no help) then went on to Canon site, for me UK, go to support and follow instructions to upgrade drivers for window 10, this has worked for me.

<p>I have just resolved this as follows:-</p>
<p>I turned off the printer.</p>
<p>In devices, removed the printer.</p>
<p>In device manager I saw the drivers disappear.</p>
<p>I turned my printer back on</p>
<p>I watched Windows 10 do its thing.</p>
<p>Everything reappeared again</p>
<p>Now the Canon quick menu auto-scan works properly.</p>

 open at a time. I also have gotten the Critical_Process_Died BSoD a couple times, but it's usually the other one. I did a scan and repair of my hard drive, as well as a diagnostics on my memory and neither found anything or fixed anything. My laptop also has
 been very very slow and after the BSoD happens and the computer restarts I get the message "</span>EFI network 0 for IPv4 boot failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an AVG scan and it found nothing, and I tried to do a MalwareBytes scan but the BSoD crashed it. Also used CCleaner to clean the registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm about to try backing up all my files and reinstalling Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would post a minidump but I don't know how to do it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Now it just tried restarting and said "No bootable device found, please restart"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted it manually and I got it to work for now, until the next BSoD happens...</p>

mini dump files are in the c driver and you share them using ondrive by making the folder or file public and sharing a link. Or by using a file sharing program like dropbox</p>

            I did the chkdsk scan already and that did nothing. Now I can't get anything to open. I managed to get it into safe mode but an error message keeps popping up and i cant do anything. I think i might take it to a repair place.

            <p>Can you remove avg in safe mode? Also, run safe mode with command prompt and run sfc/scannow or dism with the /limitaccess flag I describe in the link to my web site form the post above. I don't know if dism will run in safe mode but you can try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is used to diagnose hardware so it probably is a hardware issue. It could be part of the disk drive that has the OS became corrupt sfc may help</p>

            Hi Vestman,
<br />
<br />I recommend that you try making a video call using Skype for Web. Use this link, please: <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Thanks,

            Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Try calling again, if that does not work..
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            How do I stop my Xbox 360 from turning off when I turn my TV off&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday night I made it to round 42 in Zombies when I started to doze off. &nbsp;I left my Xbox on, but I turned my screen off. &nbsp;When I woke up today, I was furious to see the startup screen.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stop my Xbox from turning off when I turn my TV off?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The power going to your Xbox is in no way connected to your TV. The only way you could shut them both off at the same time is it they're plugged into the same outlet and you used the switch to turn the television off instead of the power button. I think
 that the most likely cause of your Xbox turning off is because in your system setting you have selected the option to have your console automatically turn off after 6 hours of inactivity.</p>

<p>Go to System Settings, Console Settings, Startup and Shutdown and make sure that you don't have Auto-Off enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check your TV settings. Many sets have an option to turn off devices connected via HDMI when the TV itself is turned off. Your television may also have this option.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies, but none of them have worked. My Xbox doesn't exactly lose power, I think it goes into some sort of sleep. The power button is lit, but when I turn my console back on, like I said, it just restarts.</p>

            Thecomputer&nbsp;reverts back to a previously used theme (the first one set up with the system).&nbsp; The computer&nbsp;titled it&nbsp;"unsaved theme."&nbsp;The "unsaved theme" consists of pictures on my hard drive.&nbsp; The d/l Microsoft theme that&nbsp;I am trying to use and have set
 up to play&nbsp;is still&nbsp;there in the Control&nbsp;Panel, but only plays for a little while and then the system reverts back to the&nbsp;"unsaved theme" like it is a default theme.&nbsp; I have deleted the "unsaved theme" &nbsp;and the system continuosly reverts back to it.&nbsp;

            Unlike the other themes, unsaved theme isn't a theme file that you can actually delete, it simply means that something has been changed (one of those 4 things I listed above) and those changes haven't been placed into a theme yet.
<div><br />
<div>So the question is, what is causing your theme to change. &nbsp;Is there any significant timing of when this happens? &nbsp;Any particular apps running when it reverts? &nbsp;Do you see it revert, or does it happen while you're away from the computer?</div>

Despite deleting the phantom, mirrored "unsaved" theme 20 times, it keeps popping up again; sometimes, I check the control panel, and the "chosen" theme is the unsaved one -- without my having chosen it; sometimes, it's the saved one.<br />
<br />
I've tried naming the "unsaved theme" entry and deleting it. That now-named phantom disappears, but "unsaved theme" mirrors continue to get created.<br />
<br />
It's downright irritating, to say the least.<br />
<br />
[P.S. Nothing is reported on three different anti-virus programs or spyware programs.]<br />

            So if I understand you correctly, the only way you know it changed is if you open up the themes list and check to see which theme is highlighted?
<div><br />
<div>That&nbsp;undoubtedly&nbsp;means that one of those 4 options are getting changed. &nbsp;As I said, any time any of these are changed, it causes your current setup to no longer match the chosen theme (of course, right?). &nbsp;And since your current setup hasn't been saved,
 it is an unsaved theme. &nbsp;Again, those options include, but are not limited to:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>
Any sound event is changed in the System Sounds Control Panel</li><li>
Any mouse cursor is selected in the Mouse Control Panel</li><li>
Any screensaver option is changed</li><li>
Any wallpaper is changed from any image program such as Paint or Photo Gallery</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>The solution is don't change or allow those to be changed. &nbsp;If a program is doing it without your approval, we need to figure out what program is doing it (it's usually things like remote control software such as GoToMyPC or WebEx because they modify settings
 to optimize bandwidth).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other obviously solution is to just quit going back into your themes list to check. &nbsp;If it's not causing any actual change, who cares if it says unsaved?</div>

            Mirror theme = no change was made to manually create&nbsp; an unnamed theme.<br />
<br />
ALL settings are identical: I checked every entry for every category against the legit theme: No changes were made.<br />
<br />
I really don't know how else to describe it: Identical, same, mirror. No change, which leads back to identical: All settings are identical.<br />
<br />
I have neither of the programs you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Not checking a potential problem is not solving it, thanks.<br />

SOMEthing has caused this for at least two of us. Nothing I did caused it, which means something else did.<br />

NO CHANGE TO SETTINGS. Got it?<br />

            <p>I can see that my theme has changed.&nbsp; It goes back to the unsaved theme after 15 minutes or so.&nbsp; Sometimes it happens when I am at the computer, sometime when I am away, and always&nbsp;after a reboot, the theme has changed back to "unsaved".&nbsp;&nbsp; It is on my computer
 at work, but my computer at home does the same thing.&nbsp; It keeps going back to the first theme installed on the computer (which at home was a microsoft d/l theme and not a personalized one like at work.)&nbsp;

<p>This has been going on for over a year.&nbsp; I just got tired of fooling with it, but I REALLY want to change my theme now.&nbsp; It's been over a year and I'm tired of looking at it.&nbsp; Plus, its bothering me that I can figure this out. :)&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!</p>

            How can you monitor a registry entry without accessing my laptop? Would you be installing that saved phantom file as your own desktop theme and track from there? (Name's accurate. I'm not a geek...lol)<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Chandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are unable to boot your Windows 7 system and it sticks at&nbsp;the welcome screen. You may try the suggestions under the section:
</span><strong>My computer hangs or freezes at the Starting Windows screen</strong> in the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows 8.1, Windows 8 or Windows 7 hangs or freezes</strong></a></p>
<p>Apart from the above suggestions, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check&nbsp;if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Please follow the underlying steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 1. </span></strong></em>Disconnect all the external devices connected except mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong></em> I would have you boot your computer in the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-last-known-good-configuration#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">last known good configuration</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If Method 1 does not help, proceed to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></em> Try to boot your system in a state of necessary Microsoft services in operation and a&nbsp;minimal set of drivers enabled, called
<em><span>Safe Mode.</span></em><br />
<strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode </span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></em> If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>

</span></strong><strong><span>to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>If Method 2 does not help, proceed to Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p>As you are unable to boot your computer at all, I would suggest you to run a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/startup-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span>How do I use Startup Repair </span></strong>in the following link.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4</span></strong></p>
<p>You can use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) to troubleshoot and repair the following items in Windows Vista or Windows 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>A master boot record (MBR)</li><li>A boot sector</li><li>A Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong>&nbsp;When you are troubleshooting startup issues by using the Windows RE, you should first try the Startup Repair option in the System Recovery Options dialog box. If the Startup Repair option does not resolve the issue, or
 if you must troubleshoot more steps manually, use the Bootrec.exe </p>

            I actually ordered the recovery disc from gateway and received them today. Unfortunately my cd drive is not working. I think it may have actually lost its drivers prior to my computer crashing. Any way to make a bootable USB drive from the disc using another

<h2>            Computer thinks printer is OFF, but it is ON. For certain, it is ON.</h2>
                    I was printing fine a couple of days ago. Today - NOPE. The computer tells me that the Printer is turned off. I turned it off and then back on. Still won't print. I checked all the settings on the printer - even went to the printers own configuration setting,
 and printed that - which would be hard to do if the printer wasn't on, right? But the computer is still telling me the Printer is off. Wireless connection, which I can access and print from my phone. Troubleshooting Wizard (clearly, not a bright Wizard) also
 says the printer is off - so it's something in the computer software or Windows 10 that can't see the printer. I have ensured that my printer driver is updated. I've turned both the printer and the computer off and back on. Still telling me that the printer
 isn't turned on. What else can I do??&nbsp; This is very disappointing and frustrating...

            Unplug if using a USB cable, or turn it off, shut computer down reboot after it comes back up wait a few minutes, plug in cable or turn printer on wait a couple of min's, test it if still not working do the same as above after removing the printing from
 the devices, last if still having issues check the support site for the maker of the printer for any updates. also posting info about your System/Printer might help us.&nbsp;

<h3> yooperchick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection drops every 30 seconds</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently (Nov 2010) started having a problem with Remote Desktop Connection where it will drop my connection every 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>My VPN is staying connected, so it's not a problem with my internet.&nbsp; There are no other users on the workstation.&nbsp; I have remote access to the machine.&nbsp; I can log in, but it will drop my connection within seconds.&nbsp; I can re-login and click another button
 or two, and again, it will drop the connection.&nbsp; This keeps happening over and over again.</p>
<p>My session is not sitting idle.&nbsp; I've updated the BIOS on my computer, did a clean boot, checked my firewall, and just about everything else that I was able to Google as suggested fixes.</p>
<p>Nothing is working and it's very frustrating!&nbsp; I know other people have been having this problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I'm still running Windows XP.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hello YooperChick,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Do you get any error
 message when the connection drops?</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Are you able to
 establish remote desktop connection normally on both the computers without using modem?</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>What happened in
 clean boot?</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried the following?</span></p>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you're using Windows Firewall, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Click<strong><span>Allow
 a program through Windows Firewall</span></strong>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Select

<h2>            Error&#58; 0x887A0005</h2>
                    <p>While attempting to save a movie project on Movie Maker (into a Movie), I received the above error. &nbsp;I've made many movies and have never encountered this before. &nbsp;In the error it states: &nbsp;"There are missing or unusable files in you Movie Maker Project that
 are preventing your movie from being saved. &nbsp;Please check that file preparation is enabled in Options, or remove the files and try again."</p>
<p>I've tried several times to save the Movie, and get this message each time. &nbsp;Occasionally one of the picks will have a caution sign on it and asks if I would like to remove it so I do. &nbsp;That doesn't seem to help. &nbsp;I looked for "file preparation" under "Options"
 but do not see that option anywhere. &nbsp; Does any one know where "file preparation" is? &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get past this error?? &nbsp;I'm thinking of aborting Windows Movie Maker all together and looking for a different video editor
 that will be compatible with Windows Movie Maker Project but not sure if there is one that exists. &nbsp;HELP</p>

</p><p>Now i find a new way to fix this. The generic USB Audio device driver doesn't recognise my microphone. Then i download and install "Realtek USB Audio" driver, update my device's driver by choose list of availabe drivers. Uncheck compatible driver, find Realtek

<h2>            My Office 365 xbox live gold 12 month redemption code will be in my account in 4 weeks WHY&#63;&#63;&#63; It never stated that on the terms&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the office 365 university and am elligible for the xbox live gold 12 month free promo but it is stating that the code will take 4 weeks. I spent hours on the phone yesterday to 7 different support people and nobody could help me. Does anyone
 have any answers?</p>
<p>I am pretty annoyed that it did not state this waiting period anywhere before I purchased the offer.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Um yes it does it is the university 4 year office 365 subscription. I clicked the link on the website and it tells me I am eligible in my Microsoft account home but when I go to the step 2 it tells me I will have the code in 4 weeks. I am in Perth WA and
 endured almost 6 hours of really mean and condescending xbox and Microsoft support people on chat and online. They were not even willing to give me any help and couldnt even answer the question. and that was 7 people. They all confirmed that I was eligible
 for the promotion also! I bought other products from microsoft yesterday and am so angry I haven't activated them and am almost at the point where I just want a refund this type of service is disgusting. I worked in retail for many years and no way can you
 get away with that!. Another thing is that having the terms not clearly stating that there is a waiting period of 4 weeks then is a breech of the ACCC and Consumer Protection Commissions code of Conduct in Australia where they have failed in their duty of
 disclosure, and are not describing the product adequately and the consumer is misled by the very loose language used!</p>

<p>As I listed above, what was available was listed in the United States (as I am in the US), what may be available for you might be completely different (which seems to be the case). Unfortunately as the promotion states, for any issues in regards to this
 promotion that's being ran by Office 365, you'd need to reach out to their support. Xbox Support has nothing to do with this promotion.</p>

<p>I don't mean to come accross as rude, but the FAQ clearly states that the University edition does not qualify. You are still getting a code anyways, and you're upset that the code that you technically should not get isn't an instant code? The fact is, even
 if your product was supposed to qualify, virtualy every MSFT promotion makes you wait up to 6 weeks for the reward/promo item.</p>

<p>I recommend making the profile you plan on using Gold with on your Xbox. Choose a Silver subscription and at the end, if you have not already made too many free accounts, you will receive a 30 day trial to Gold. By the end of your trial, you would have received
 your 12 month code.</p>

<p>that is a brilliant work around (no sarcasm). I just got off the phone with support from 365 and the tech said that human beings, not computers, are determining the eligibility of said promo. I applaud Microsoft's interest in creating jobs for humans, INSTEAD
 OF USING A COMPUTER AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO, WITHIN SECONDS, DETERMINE THAT I AM DAMN ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STUPID DAMN PROMO (absolute sarcasm). Way to go microsoft, and thank you technician for helping me with my questions.</p>

<p>I'm really annoyed about this, as well. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time chatting with 2 separate chat agents, one from Office and one from Xbox. &nbsp;Neither could tell me where to go to get my code. &nbsp;I emailed Sam's Club (where I purchased my new laptop as well as the
 365 Home Premium), and they told me exactly where to go, and what to do. &nbsp;Tell me how that works!! &nbsp;A customer service rep, who doesn't even work for Microsoft, knew what was up?? &nbsp;Anyway, I was curious if you are still waiting, or is it going to take the
 full 4 weeks? &nbsp;If it's going to take that long, I supposed I better be calling Netflix to explain it to them to see if I can get a refund for this month, since I won't be using it. &nbsp;Microsoft is really starting to upset me.</p>

<p>Hey there Brackney,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having a frustrating experience.<br />
<br />
If you haven't already, you should be able to follow the steps for code redemption listed here:
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/buy-office-365-get-12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-FX104049875.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/buy-office-365-get-12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-FX104049875.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The waiting period for verifying eligibility for the promotion is listed on the site as "approximately 4 weeks". It may take the full 4 weeks for the codes to be sent.</p>
