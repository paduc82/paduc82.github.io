<h2>            Windows 10 bad_system_config_info</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from a previous version of Windows (cannot recall which one).&nbsp; Have a few problems, but I have always been able to fix it or revert back to an older build.&nbsp; But now:&nbsp; Windows 10 bad_system_config_info goes into Automatic Repair which then gives
 Choose keyboard layout.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this error is making all USB ports inoperable; therefore no keyboard or mouse.&nbsp; I tried to re-install Windows 10 using the DVD drive, but the USB port is still inoperable so I cannot "hit any key" to boot from DVD.&nbsp;
 Does anyone have any other suggestions?&nbsp; I would be happy to just be able to get a c: prompt.&nbsp; Then I can copy all my files through DOS and wipe the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions!&nbsp; : )</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You need to be able to use your mouse and keyboard in order to booting from a DVD. However, you mentioned that all USB ports are inoperable thus rendering your mouse and keyboard ineffective. If possible, we suggest that you use a mouse and keyboard that
 has <strong>PS/2 sockets</strong>.</p>
<p>

<h2>            My Xbox live gamertag has changed and I can no longer sign in to Xbox Live via 360</h2>
                    
<p>Last week I was known as zZFlickerBeanZz, I turned on my xbox today to get this message:</p>
<p>"Sorry this profile can't connect to xbox live on this profile. To fix it, download it again."</p>

<p>I signed into my account on xbox.com and it says my gamertag is now CleanFawn780996.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas what's going on?</p>

<p>The enforcement team are the only ones who handle forced gamertag changes. For an official response from them, you will need to post here -
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a></p>
<p>Per the code of conduct that you agreed to, if the enforcement team determined a gamertag violates the code of conduct, you are given a randomly generated tag and you will have to pay to change it to something else. It doesn't matter how long you've had
 a tag or why you were reported, the enforcement team are the ones who determine whether or not a tag violates the code.</p>

                    <p>After installing a Brother DCP-7065DN printer in the Admin account, I can't set the printer as a default in my user account.&nbsp; The printer is showing as an active device there.&nbsp;&nbsp;The printer is set as a default printer in the Admin account and works fine in
 all programs using a printer in the Admin account.&nbsp; The printer is directly hooked&nbsp;up via USB cable to&nbsp;my&nbsp;laptop, which is a 64 bit machine.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;uninstalled the print driver and re-installed&nbsp;the recommended 64 bit version for my Brother printer, but the
 problem persists.&nbsp; In some programs on my user account, the printer will show as an available option,&nbsp;ie,&nbsp;MS Word 2007, but MS Excel does not recognize the printer at all.&nbsp; I have tried setting the sharing attribute in the Admin account, but this did not work,
 either.&nbsp; In Adobe Reader X in my user account, the only printer available is a printer that is not on the system - Quickbooks PDF Converter, even after uninstalling Reader X and re-installing it.&nbsp; I have checked the registry and there is no entry for Quickbooks
 PDF Converter???&nbsp; I have also turned off User Account Control, but this did not help at all, either.</p>

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the printer?<br />
3. Do you receive any error message?<br />
4. Did you try the steps dated on September 4, 2012?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may following steps for assigning a Default Printer:</p>
<div><span>a.<span> </span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>Control printers</b> in the<b><i>Start Search</i></b> box, and then click
<b>Control Printers</b> in the <b>Programs</b> list. </div>
<div><span>b.<span> </span></span><i>Right-click</i> the printer that you want to use, and then click<b>Set as Default Printer</b>. A check mark on the printer icon indicates that the printer is now the default printer.

<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may t<span>emporarily disable the antivirus and firewall on the computer and check.<br />
</span></p>

            It's worked like a charm - I found some programs that I deleted on the "old" profile that are claiming to be still installed on the "new" profile but they won't uninstall :S. I also found some programs that were installed on the "old" profile but aren't
 found on the "new" one. I'm not sure how to make those that won't uninstall do so but the other is easily&nbsp;rectifiable!
<div><br />
<div>So here is my sadder problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In attempting to fix this problem due to a prognosis of someone from Microsoft I was attempting to do a scaled down version of wipe and restart the whole computer. Since, I couldn't at the time find my Windows 7 CD and still can't find my Microsoft Office
 CD I removed all my data and a LOT of programs and did some clean up using some trusted spyware programs and de-fragmented the disc and started again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>During the process I had "moved" not copied my "My Documents Folder". As a consequence Outlook was popping up errors and I did a rash thing....</div>
<div><br />
<div>The files I moved (outlook.pst I think and I KNOW archieve.pst) were from the "My Documents" but in my rashness - wanting to fix the error I moved them 'back' to c:/users/PROFILE/AppData/Microsoft/Outlook folder. Upon opening Outlook again - the error
 didn't go away........but all my emails from my now dead grandfather and all my emails since my now new husband I and were first dating to the present were gone. (Please note the copy is gone now from the backup cause I MOVED it back)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not the end of my rashness - I did a "Recover" the the state it was in before the move - pretty sure it wouldn't 'fix' Outlook - it didn't so I tried an option presented to me to "undo recover"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Long story short on both profiles - these emails seem GONE FOREVER - and it's made me very sad. Furthermore the email that these came from - I no longer have access to - i changed internet providers :S</div>
<div><br />
<div>I expect this to be a non-recoverable screw up but.....I thought I'd ask.....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>You're a wise person my friend and I'm happy to think with a few fixes I have a profile that will work!!</div>

            <span>FIX TO Operation could not be completed (error 0x00000709)</span>
<p><span>Hi Guys, </span>
</p>
<p><span>So I’m assuming you’re quite frustrated by now that you can’t set your printer to default.
</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sure the frustration isn’t because you can’t set it default, but because you can’t print PDF’s (because Adobe doesn’t list your new printer in the list) or Word/Excel doesn’t print. No worries.
 Keep Calm And Read Below!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The following is a lengthy FIX but it will work. This FIX is for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Warning: This involves changing you’re registry key therefore, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES delete anything or change anything that you don’t know.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>So many of you may be confused about HKEY or HKCU and etc or how to get to
</span>HKEY\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\ and etc. </p>
<p>So here is how it begins:- </p>
<p><u>Where the problem is</u></p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “start” and type “regedit”. Right click on regedit and click “Run as Administrator”. Expand “HKEY_Current_User” then expand “Software”. Then expand “Microsoft” then expand “Windows NT” and then “CurrentVersion”
 and finally “Windows”. </p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Look to your right. There is something called “Device”. Look at the 3<sup>rd</sup> column (Data). It probably shows the data for the old printer. This is the device name you need to change in order to fix the issue.
 Double click on device and here you can see we need the new “value data:” of your printer. If you already know the new value of your printer, then add it here. (DO NOT GUESS IT. NO, the name and model of your printer is not the value.)</p>
<p>So far, I’ve only showed you where the problem is. </p>
<p><u>How to Fix</u></p>
<p>Now we need to find out what the correct “value data:” is for your printer. The only way I was able to find mine was to make a new user account and give it administrative rights. For some reason, the new user account will have the correct
 registry keys (names, values, data) everything. </p>
<p>To do this, go to control panel and under “User Accounts and Safety” click “Add or remove User accounts”. Once created, go to the shutdown menu and “switch users”. Go to the new user. It will take some time to load.
</p>
<p>Once loaded, go through the same steps as mentioned above under “Where the problem is”. Open the “device” and look at the new name. This new name should be your new printer. Now write this whole thing down. i.e. for my printer, the new
 name was “Brother MFC-J435W Printer,winspool,LPT1:”. Some printer’s names are “NE04” or something like that, which is why I told you not to guess it above.
</p>
<p>Once you have this name, switch users again and come back to your original account.
</p>
<p>Now again, go back to “regedit” and open “Device”. Put your new printer name here and press ok.
</p>
<p>This should work. </p>
<p><b><u>If error occurs: FIXING “error writing to registry”</u></b></p>
<p>To Fix this error, do the following:- </p>
<p>Make sure you opened “regedit” as “Run as Administrator”. i.e. by right clicking it.
</p>
<p>If you did, then within regedit, go back to the “Device” section. In the left column where it says “Windows”, right click on “windows” and select “Permissions..”. It should have the “special permissions” block checked. Uncheck this block
 and check “Full Control” “Allow” (This should automatically check Read as Allow).
</p>
<p>Now try changing the name to the one you found from the other user.
</p>
<p>And this will work!!! Close everything and try printing a PDF/Word file or whatever.
</p>

</p><p>We need to confirm first the Skype and OS version you are using on your Android device to isolate the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by chance, you are using the new Skype application v.8.2 then, this was not a feature introduced on the new Skype yet.&nbsp;When users log out and decide to log back in again, the application would not save the last log in credentials of the last user who

<p>
</p><p>Do&nbsp;not worry, our support team is working hard to improve the application. So, keep those feedbacks coming in as we are collating them to pass it along to the appropriate support team. You can track latest fixes, newest update releases and upcoming features

    <title>Restore computer to factory Default and re-install Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mary annegravelle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore computer to factory Default and re-install Windows 7 Professional &#40;no discs&#41;</h2>
                    I did a system image back-up of this computer, Toshiba, two days ago.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am unable to get the computer out of running in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My goal was to restore my computer to factory default and re-install Windows 7 Professional. &nbsp;I do not have the discs although I have the info that says I own Windows 7 Professional that is installed on this computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been reading about doing a factory restore - and the option to choose that with an option also for the Windows 7 O/S is supposed to appear when I followed the directions. &nbsp;It has not - I just keep going around in circles and can't find the links
 I'm looking for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done this on my other computer which has a 2g disc - back-up was so simple and straight-forward. &nbsp;I did it once before and then obviously had to download all the updates. &nbsp;I did the factory default and o/s again on Sunday - and it was so simple
 - all prompted and even to the point of creating factory default discs (emachine) and system recovery disc - in total - 3 DVD's. &nbsp;My Toshiba took 7 DVD's - although I do understand I did a system image rather than back-up - it also did a recover disc. &nbsp;I did
 it in case I wasn't able to get back my Windows 7 Pro. &nbsp;What I would like to do is clean the computer right out - to basically brand-new condition and install Windows 7 Pro again and THEN BACK-UP a clean system image. &nbsp;I have no files on my computer that were
 necessary - yet it did a system image of 12G and 14.0 G. - I obviously do not know what I'm doing - :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please - I hope I am able to get some help quickly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know why it is so difficult for me to find the prompts as I did on my emachine - factory default condition and restore o/s - I don't want to do it to a recovery point - I want to have it clean.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You post is very confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You state that you want to recover back to Factory Settings, then reinstall Window 7 Pro, implying that Windows 7 Pro did not come preinstalled on the Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And&nbsp;restoring a System Image (Complete PC Backup) is done differently to copying back your Data files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Restore your computer from a system image backup"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recover a Toshiba to Factory Settings you press 0 (Zero) at boot to start the process.</p>

            Thank You &nbsp;very much for your response Bill.
<div><br />
<div>I will now attempt to restore to Toshiba factory default settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows version that came with my PC was XP. &nbsp;I later had my PC cleaned and was provided with a reburbished Windows 7 Profressional License.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I imagine my question above was very confusing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What had happened was I did do a System Image Backup and since that time I am unable to get the computer to come our of "safe mode" - have used the F8 key, F2 &amp; F12. &nbsp;Have also run repairs and there are no errors appearing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I did the System Image Backup it has sort of been "stuck" in that state. &nbsp;I tried to use the System Recovery and o/s recovery disc that was also created at the end of the System Image Backup. &nbsp;I don't know how to make the computer read it - or acknowledge
 it - or make it "run".</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is obvious that I am very limited in the IT department.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I will do is copy my license key before restoring my Toshiba Satellite to it's Factory Default condition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, thank you for your reply. &nbsp;It is very much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mary Anne.</div>

            <p>Hold on and don't wipe anythnig yet.</p>
<p>Factory Recovery would take you back to XP, but through installing Windows 7 that option would have been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also applies to Windows 7 to get out of Safe Mode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>

<br />
</li><li>In the Start Menu Search Box type <strong>msconfig</strong> </li><li>Then press <strong>enter</strong> on your keyboard. <br />
<br />

<h2>            How to Sync iphone with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I just installed Windows 10 and see that there is an app called photos that allows me to&nbsp;import photos from my iPhone 8. I want to&nbsp;be able to import from my iPhone,&nbsp;make albums on my PC and organize the albums and then export the albums back to my iPhone
 from my PC and basically sync the PPPC and iPhone whenever I&nbsp;like.&nbsp;I do not like iTunes&nbsp;or iCloud&nbsp;and&nbsp;how&nbsp;they work. I like&nbsp;Google photos but wanted something that would be saved onto my hard drive rather than in the cloud. Does anyone know of an app or program
 that will allow me to do this?&nbsp;</p>

            Looks like update engine cannot connect to the Internet. Are you using a proxy server or a 3rd party firewall?
<br />Try installing the latest updates if you have an Intel machine:

            Option 1, you can try manually install it:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-install-the-latest-windows-10-insider-build/d8c389ae-31c4-42a2-97df-4815d82dd2b6">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>
<br />
<br />That error you are seeing in Windows Defender:
<br />
<br />Is your computer connected to a domain?
<br />Are you using BitLocker?
<br />
<br />What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?
<br />As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you disable the driver signature enforcement by following these steps:
<br />Click Start.
<br />Click the Power button.
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. 
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can install the programs. If you're successful, boot back into the UEFI/BIOS and re-enable Secure Boot since this is an important security feature.
<br />
<br />We look forward to your response and the results of the initial troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<h2>            Error Code 0.8007045D while installing Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Error Code 0.8007045D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently tried to do a clean install from the installation disk of Windows 7 and got the error code shown in the title. I understand it is an input-output error, but I am not sure how to go about fixing it, or what exactly the ramifications are.
<br />
<br />
I am running a Dell Inspiron N5010 with an Intel i3 processor. I am running Linux Mint 11 and Windows 7 Home Edition 64 bit. Unfortunately, the Windows partition is currently unusable.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

    <title>Will Windows 10 Update Restart Even If PC Is Off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawnbeachy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Windows 10 Update Restart Even If PC Is Off&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Win10 TP, build 9926. In the Windows Update section, it has an area where it automatically schedules a restart (after downloading updates) during a time when you don't usually use your device. Right now it is using 3:00 A.M. But my PC is not
 even on at 3:00 A.M. My question is, will it still restart and apply updates correctly, or must I leave my PC on all night in order for it to update?

            Go to the <strong>Visual Effects</strong> tab.&nbsp; Open up the full list of effects by clicking the down arrow in the lower right. Under
<strong>Motions and Fades</strong> find the 4th icon entitled <strong>Fade out to black</strong>.&nbsp; The icon looks like a darkened image.&nbsp; Click it to apply that effect to your picture.

Most of the time it will. Try it, it's not hard to do.<br />

I use IE9, I don't have any major problems, just the random signing out and can't sign back in, unless I delete my cookies.</span></strong>

<p>Unfortunately it seems you have to clear cookies on a regular basis - Ive had to do it 3or 4 times in the last 2 days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried setting up exceptions to only keep session cookies for forums.xbox.com, but still no joy, so Ive just been manually deleting he forums.xbox.com cookie folder (within Firefox 4 options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together with all the site "updates", its like MS are actively trying to discourage people from coming here...</p>

    <title>Wireless Speed Wheel Warning&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hopfrogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Speed Wheel Warning&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Just a heads up.&nbsp; It's pretty bad.</p>
<p>Normally I don't like to bag on products, but I am going to because this thing is non-returnable for a refund (according to newegg), and I don't want to see anyone else out 60 bucks and stuck with this thing.</p>
<p>I've run the F4 demo for a few hours over the same track and settings with both the speed wheel and the controller and my controller times were way faster and the speed wheel just felt wonky and laggy.</p>
<p>Does it have a use?&nbsp; Yes, if you need something to give a kid or grandparent to mess around with, then sure it has a use.&nbsp; For real Forza fans... steer clear!&nbsp; A lot of people write things like "wow, I am suprised at how responsive it is".... uh yeah, put
 it through some serious testing and you'll see it is junk for competitive racing.&nbsp; You look at something like that and don't expect it to work well so it can easily impress at first, but the shine fades fast.</p>
<p>You've been warned.</p>

<p>So you all go on with the name calling... &nbsp;I'm here for help from whoever can give it.</p>
<p>I've bought my speed wheel, I like the controls and would love it if, and maybe someone can tell me how, I could assign my buttons from the defaults.</p>
<p>I can't even play Hydro Thunder Huricane, when the game boots up, it thinks the speed wheel is a full blown wheel with pedals and therefore my boost and boost jump don't work.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I STOP THIS FROM HAPPINING?</p>

<p>I have Forza 4 *and* have the Speed Wheel. I get better times with the Speed Wheel over the standard controller. &nbsp;After I went into the controller's advanced settings and changed it a bit, I won't go back to a controller. &nbsp;Yes, I'd prefer a full wheel/pedal
 setup but that's not going to happen. &nbsp;I highly recommend it.</p>

<h2>            How can I stop my desktop from changing the position of my desktop icons&#63;</h2>
                    I keep having this problem where my desktop is always moving icons all the way to the left side of my screen. I recently pulled off a few viruses and did a clean reboot. After doing multiple scans with multiple tools I have confirmed that my system is
 completely clean of said infections. And yet, every single time my desktop is refreshed--F5 being an example--all of my icons will rearrange themselves from the positions that I placed and become shoved right back into the left hand side of my screen again.<br />
Is there a setting somewhere I can change so that my icons will <i>stay</i> where I put them instead of constantly moving around when the screen is refreshed?<br />

            You can create as many repair disks and system images as you want using the Windows 7 Backup program.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>﻿Create system repair disc</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
&nbsp;<span>Open Backup and Restore by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Backup and Restore.
</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>In the left pane, click Create a system repair disc, and then follow the steps. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Create A System Image In Windows 7
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>After you install and activate Windows 7 create a system image as a backup for your current computer in case you ever need to reinstall it. This will restore your computer
 to it's exact state when the image was made - that will save you the trouble of having to reinstall Windows 7 and everything currently installed again, and it takes much less time to do.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>1. &nbsp;Click the Start Menu and type "Back Up" then click on Back up your Files. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. &nbsp;In the Control Panel window that appears, Click the blue Create a system image link.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. &nbsp;The Create a system image window should pop-up. &nbsp;Select which hard disk, DVD, or network location you are going to save your system image to. &nbsp;Click Next to continue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. &nbsp;On the next page check both your System and System Reserved drives. &nbsp;Once you have selected the drives Click Next to continue. Note: You can select as many drives as you
 want (if available), but the more you choose to include means the larger the image size will be.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. &nbsp;The next window is just a review, make sure everything is correct then Click Start backup to start the process. &nbsp;This can take 10 minutes or more so patience is required.
