                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This forum has been very helpful to me since Windows 10 was released. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said though, I have to admit that on some occasions, if the problem I’m having isn’t solved almost right away, it never gets any more hits and I have to find a solution some place else. It would be nice if the “experts” would come on, apologize
 for being unable to help any further, or make suggestions to where a solution might be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually when Microsoft screws up a computer with one of it's "Upgrades" it should stand by it's software and make thing correct. I have just received the Fall Creators Update on one of my computers, can't establish a network connection, and can't Recover
 to the earlier version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does mapping network drive have anything to do with this. I do not believe it does. You want some good advice, I would never ever create a mapped network drive. There is no reason for it and it is just a precursor to corrupt system files and problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a clean install of Version 1703 then select that with the media creation tool, if you can still install older version. But you will be forced to install 1709 through windows update. You are better off installing a clean install of 1709 as I mentioned.

</p><p>Mapping network drives has everything to do with it, every upgrade trashes my home network. Your good advice falls on deaf ears, we are not experts, we learned about networking probably with Windows Xp, it has worked for us for many years and we don't want
 to send a lot of time learning anything new, which by the way we don't even know what that would be. And if mapping network drives is a precursor to corrupt system files then I would blame Windows 10 for that. It sounds to me that if it ain't broke - break
 it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else reading this thread, a clean install requires reinstall all of your software, so be sure you know all of your product keys, registration info, and passwords. Give yourself a lot of time, and if it's some else's computer you may be in big
 trouble if you don't handle it gently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you understand where I'm coming from, we had a perfectly good home network, our backups were working fine, my wife needs a picture printed she could put in our Xfer folder, I have another computer in my workshop where can look at a CAD drawing on
 my office computer ( I can still do that, but for how long). Now I clean install means sitting down with my wife, finding out which programs she has that has to reinstall right away make sure all registration info is available, were, looking at several long
 days of work - that is not fun.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>First, Did you reboot modem/router by unplugging for 45 seconds, plugging back in, after it connects, restarting all PC's in your Home Network and see if you can connect to internet with this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get your point. But, if you can not reset back to previous 1703 and you can spend hours and hours messing around or do a clean install. If you retrieve the Key Code with the program I provided you and create a bootable DVD with the new 1709 version, then
 you will have no issues installing it. All I was saying is mapping network drives in my opinion is worthless and can or will cause issues. it probably may not have anything to do with you connecting to internet or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for installing all your software again, yes, I mentioned it and to save all your program installers and driver packages, which you probably will not need since Windows has most all of them, (Generic Drivers). As for you remembering passwords for websites
 and such, well that would suck if you can not remember some of them. </p>

<p>I also lost my network connectivity after the Fall Creators Update. This update disabled or uninstalled several drivers - one of them was my Wi-Fi network adapter. The recently updated adapter was not compatible with the Fall Creators Update - I had to uninstall
 it and re-install the original version from CD. That fixed my connectivity problem immediately.</p>

<p>
</p><p>oh you stated &gt;&gt;one of my computers, can't establish a network connection. So to other PC's on your network I can now assume. On a new install or sometimes on an upgrade, you will have to click on the other PC's in your network folder the first time and
 enter a user name and password and select to remember&nbsp;to access their PC. and vise versa on those PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a Network by default. It is your network folder with the other PC's listed on it to share between PC's in the Public folders. And you can put them in the public folder to share.&nbsp; You can also right click on any folder or file and select properties
 and sharing tab&gt;&gt;Advanced Sharing (For Network Folders)&nbsp;and share them. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ead2e21-d989-4eef-b207-69cfde668476?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ead2e21-d989-4eef-b207-69cfde668476?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then you have the HomeGroup which shares devices and 4 personal files by default and you can share other files and folders in Homegroup You can also right click on any folder or file and select properties and sharing tab&gt;&gt;Share and select Share. In the Box
 select Homegroup and Add and select permissions. then chick on share on bottom.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eb950d0-8332-47ed-8384-57877bd82868?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eb950d0-8332-47ed-8384-57877bd82868?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will never need to map a network drive. If you want to share a whole drive, then do so by its sharing properties.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to this link and it explains everything about sharing in network and homegroup. It is also to help and try and fix the issue in Windows 10 of missing PC's showing in the Network Folder. But in all, it explains about sharing.</p>

            Hi FilipHeist 
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, is that driver currently installed on your PC and you want to transfer it to another PC?
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of the WiFi card you need to install (go to Device Manager - Network Adapters)
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of the PC you need to install that driver onto

<p>The drivers included in Windows are not in a format that can be stored outside Windows, thus they are of no use to you. You need the
<em>installers</em> for drivers, so that you can install or re-install them as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got installers for all my computer's drivers stored on a USB flash drive, just as you want to do. In addition, I made a text file for each driver that has installation instructions and any other information I might need to know in order to install the
 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the installers on the hardware manufacturers' websites, just as I did. Every hardware manufacturer has a section of their website called 'Support' or 'Downloads' and that's where you get the drivers along with the manufacturer's installation
 instructions which you should follow carefully. (In other words, don't do what I did!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got two suggestions for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Don't remove an older driver from your USB flash drive just because a newer driver has been published. Your computer might like the older driver better!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- In addition to drivers, many types of hardware use another type of software called 'firmware.' Don't forget to include firmware updates on your USB flash drive.</p>

            Thanks for your suggestions and instructions.&nbsp; This may be above my paygrade. Usually the computer searches for the driver that is needed for the hardware.&nbsp; In this case I do not have internet because it is the usb wireless adapter that needs the driver.
 Any other fixes would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This FREE utility makes it easy to see the device maker and versions loaded.&nbsp;And it<br />
provides methods to seek out&nbsp;drivers.<br />
<br />
Run DriverView - Free -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Right Click the&nbsp;Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - <br />
write down the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click <br />
- Driver's tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not
<br />
do anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After entering each&nbsp;command in the run command&nbsp;window,&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;wait until the command is executed successfully. After the SFC scan is completed, it will give out the report of the scan on the
 window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>R<span>un the
<strong>PowerShell </strong>commands by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows
<strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the .NET Framework, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration
 of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>Open an Administrator command window by</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>CTRL + Shift + ESC</strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Step 3:

<p><strong><span><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 4:
</strong>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Step 5:
</strong>Check the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<ol>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If not, <strong>restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new <strong>Administrator user account</strong>.

            <p>After many, .. weeks. after tens (10+++) of tryings; &nbsp;Windows 10 Taskbar works, finally::::</p>
<p>Do not know for how long time, but I did followings,</p>
<p>(Ref: All possible solution by many Microsoft assistance person no, help)</p>
<p>So, I do not know what helps or what happened but:</p>
<p>1. First:</p>
<p>I did did:</p>
<p>ctrl+shift+esc</p>
<p>select Apps</p>
<p>Windows Explorer, pressed Restart in down right corner</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>generally I did not note, nothing happens, but that changed its shape, lets it be so</p>
<p>I restart pc.</p>
<p>Nothing changed, Taskbar did not worked.</p>
<p>NEXT</p>
<p>- I closed all open softwares</p>
<p>- Press Winlogo + X, in writing pad</p>
<p>- Chose command front alternative with Administrative rights</p>
<p>- c:\Windows\System32\ &nbsp;--- &gt; write &nbsp;Powershell &nbsp;and press enter</p>
<p>after that write following command line:</p>
<p><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></p>
<p><span>press enter</span>- Restart pc.</p>
<p>What different happened under Powershell in running command line:</p>
<p>Command run software lines visible again, in running outlook.</p>
<p>All similar advice's in here, &nbsp;did; not run under Powershell command visible re-lining softwares, only earlier I saw under Powershell command: 20% done....... 100% and "halas".</p>
<p>So, first time, given command line run visible all software lines again, giving summary about done re-run of softwares, in summary was stated for example Microsoft:NET runtime .... not installed as "there is newer"in etc, something like that.</p>
<p>I Wish, this will help some one, as after weeks tryings I got Taskbar working</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 update causing PC to crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaac sim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update causing PC to crash</h2>
                    The most recent Windows update occasionally causes my PC to crash during the booting phase. I tried using the troubleshooter, but it failed to accomplish anything. I've tried restarting my PC several times but it all lead back to it not being able to start
 properly. The only way I can get around this is by doing a system restore back to a period before the recent Windows 10 update. I'm fine using the older version of Windows but my PC just updates back to the updated version. After a couple of days, the same
 problem comes back to bite me in the bum. I have already done 4 system restores and it's kinda getting irritating. Any suggestions on how to prevent my PC from crashing.

<p>My laptop keeps crashing every 1/2 hour and is terrible slow if it works.</p>
<p>The processor&nbsp;capacity is used between 60 and 90 % all the time by the system itself. Very strange</p>

</p><p>On closer inspection of the .zip file I was trying to extract, it contained several parent/child folders and obviously was increasing the path of the file that was erroring to an unacceptable level.</p>

            Since my post on 12/01/12 I found a replacement program for the MS CardFile program.&nbsp; Click on the following link to check it out.<br />
<br />
http://www.azzcardfile.com/<br />
<br />
I doubt MS will be very helpful with solving this problem untill, just how bad Windows 8 really is, has had time to sink in.&nbsp; They can't even get Windows Update to work.&nbsp;

            <p>I have used AZZ Carfile for years. It is an excellent, free-form app that works like cardfile.exe, only better. I have used it with Windows 95, 98, and now Windows 8. I highly recommend it. The&nbsp;CNET community&nbsp;likes it too and gives it 4.5 stars.&nbsp;See

            I have tried to fix this cardfile.exe by using compatibility troubleshooter but it doesn't work, it asks me to "test the program."&nbsp; When I tap the "test the program" button nothing happens.&nbsp; Anyway, cardfile.exe will still not install.

            <p>As reported by phx.rising in 2013, I have used AZZ4 cardfile from W2000 to 8.1 over the years and have had no serious problem with it. &nbsp;In fact I have had few problems with old programs even in 8.1. &nbsp;I still run the old Money2004 in 8.1 as I haven't found
 anything better for handling home accounts. &nbsp;If you have any problems with a new windows interface, just dive below it and you will find the old familiar Windows NT underneath still paddling hard !!</p>

            <p>Thanks for that, Ron.&nbsp; I just installed the Geert Cardfile app and it works fine.&nbsp; Only issue is the font is quite small and there are no options for changing it, but what the heck, it's free!</p>
I created a folder under Programs (not Programs X86) called "Geert" and copied the unzipped cardfile .exe into it along with my .CRD files from the old MS Cardfile.&nbsp; Run the .exe, then File-Open the main .CRD file that you use.&nbsp; Once it is open, click Setup
 and tell it to put a shortcut on your desktop (the only mode I use for Win 8.1) and also tell it to use the Geert Cardfile to open all .CRD files.&nbsp; Once I did that, I went to my MAIN.CRD file in the folder and created a shortcut to it on the desktop.&nbsp; Just
 click-click that shortcut and you're right into your cardfile - easy as pie!&nbsp; Of course you can do the same thing for every .CRD file that you want to use.

<p>Hi Gudiya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you've encountered in creating a folder could be caused by software or program conflict as the issue appeared a few days after installing the Windows 10 Creators update. For us to know if this only occurs when creating a new folder from the desktop,
 we suggest that you try creating a new folder using a keyboard shortcut or from File Explorer. Please refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new folder using a keyboard shortcut.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the desktop.</li><li>Press <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + N</strong>.</li><li>A new folder should be created.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new folder from File Explorer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Hover your mouse on the location where you want to create a new folder.</li><li>Right-click it, go to<strong> New &gt; Folder</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case the problem persists, then we suggest that you go ahead and perform a clean boot. Doing so will start your computer using minimal drivers to help us determine what conflict is causing the problem. Check out
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></strong> for the detailed steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result so we can further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks, the step you mentioned &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the desktop.
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + N</strong>.</li><li>A new folder should be created.</li><li>Creating a new folder using a keyboard shortcut.</li></ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's&nbsp; working for me. But my <strong>new folder option </strong>is not working anywhere not in desktop as well as not in file explorer. Whenever I am placing my cursor on new folder option, its first spinning for few seconds then&nbsp; goes to close the file
 explorer and refresh the desktop once.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you effectively, were there any recent change done to your PC prior to the issue?
</p>
<p>If you updated your PC to a newer version of Windows 10, the Bluetooth device might not work after the update.
</p>
<p>You will need to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17156/windows-10-connect-to-bluetooth-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pair the Bluetooth device</a></strong> again to use it. Also, check the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10568/windows-10-supported-bluetooth-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Supported Bluetooth Profiles</a></strong>

            <p>In addition, there are a couple of questions.&nbsp; Does your system have an OEM drivers for Win 10, and if so have you tried installing those?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an older system and what version of Bluetooth does it use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are hundreds of folks with this problem what steps have you taken, as suggested by those threads, to correct your situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be as simple as your Bluetooth device will not function in Windows 10.&nbsp; Since there have been some Wireless adapters with the same problem, it is a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't get it to work, do you have the option to upgrade your Bluetooth device.&nbsp; On many laptops the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are on the same physical card so replacing one of those is normally fairly easy..&nbsp; A USB dongle is not expensive..</p>

</p><p>Hello Joanna 777 and Saltgrass ...</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest.</p>
<p>I got Bluetooth working again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to repeat the steps below every time Microsoft updates itself.</p>
<p>The problem is more than just pairing the Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth option disappears from the settings menu.</p>
<p>This is a Windows 10 update bug that someone should check.</p>
<p><em><strong>But at least I have a consistent solution: delete the drivers and reinstall them.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please see the pictures of &nbsp;Device Manager and TaskManager below.</p>
<p>Three drivers were present in DeviceManager and the services were running.</p>
<p>When I checked for updates, I got the message saying the drivers were up to date.</p>
<p>SO ... I deleted the drivers and downloaded them from the DELL website and installed.</p>
<p>

            <p>You never really told us anything about your system, such as is it a laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The terminology used to describe Network Adapters can be very confusing to me.&nbsp; For instance, I see Intel has a Wireless-N 7260 but the Centrino description is not mentioned.&nbsp; Possibly that is just referring to the Processor used in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a <strong>Dual Ban</strong><strong>d</strong> Wireless-AC 7260 which works very well and never had any Windows 10 problems.&nbsp; I have seen several versions of a single band Wireless-N device which have problems with Win 10, so possibly that is your
 basic situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Bluetooth icon disappears from the tray, the device is probably disappearing from the Device Manager.&nbsp; I believe the system is loosing communications to the device which causes it to disappear.&nbsp; You might enable the ability to view hidden devices
 in Device Manager and see what you show.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing you might do is open up the panel for access to the Wireless card and reseat it and make sure the antenna leads are secure.&nbsp; Make sure and power down your system and remove the battery or external power.&nbsp; If you do this, take the time to
 take a picture or verify the configuration of that card in case you might decide to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just received my new Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 which came with a single band wireless adapter.&nbsp; I have a Dual band version ready to replace it and will be testing the quality of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on both cards.....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some info I picked up on the Intel site.</p>
<p>

<strong>Does an Intel Bluetooth® adapter work on Windows</strong><strong>®</strong><strong> 10?</strong>
<p>Yes. Uninstall the Intel® PROSet/Wireless Software (Bluetooth®) before you install Windows 10. If you don't uninstall the software, the OS upgrade process will not complete. Microsoft installs basic Bluetooth® drivers that allow you to use your Intel Bluetooth®
 adapter. To take advantage of advanced settings and more profiles, you must upgrade your Intel Bluetooth® driver.</p>

<p>Hi - in the past the usual way to upload CDs has been using <strong>WMP</strong> and although the program is being steadily run down it remains the best option at present, although your new PC may have an alternative choice&nbsp;like Cyberlink Power2Go.</p>
<p>The preset&nbsp;default music app&nbsp;will be&nbsp;Groove Music but this has no rip option so you'll need to open Windows Media Player and configure it. Use your start/search option to find WMP&nbsp;and set it up initially with recommended settings. Get back once this is done
 and we can check everything is in place... Cheers, Ric.</p>

            I have not tried the instructions provided as yet.&nbsp; The instructions provided seemed logical, but how does one learn everything one needs to know about Windows 10, especially Windows 10 that has been preloaded on a new computer.&nbsp; Honestly, I liked my old
 computer, which I upgraded to Windows 10 from Microsoft's site where when I loaded a CD, it always prompted me as to what I wanted to do with this CD.&nbsp; In some ways, I can understand the logic to the explanation given, but this type of information needs to
 communicated to all who preload Windows on new computers for clients, or it should be defaulted by Windows and then let the computer user decide.

<p>I see your point - and it's not just when it is pre-loaded! We had the Fall update not long ago and that reset the defaults for all my music files to Groove (which is also being run down to some extent).</p>
<p>My main music player is iTunes for Windows but I prefer WMP to manage the music library so that has now been re-set as default. The problem with having Groove is that it has no CD options - it is not a disc friendly program. I have just sidelined it.</p>
<p>Anyway - once you are set up you should not get too much interference (at least until the next major update is released) so let me know if you want me to talk you through it... or I may be able to find a step by step guide on youtube - some of those are
 very helpful&nbsp;. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

<h2>            Your device will be genuine shortly... seems stuck</h2>
                    <p>So I just purchased windows 10 off the store app and it says it will make my device genuine shortly but it has been a couple hours and it is still on that screen. I'm just wondering fi it supposed to take a long time or if there is some sort of error happening.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello KLIVICKIS RULES.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to submit a refund request, the owner of the email that was used will need to assist on this. Once this has been done, then please visit the "Request a refund" page which can be found here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4017804/requesting-a-refund
</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? Are you using any external mouse?
</p>
<p>2. Have you made any recent software or hardware prior to the issue? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue normally occurs when there is any driver conflicts. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Press <font><b>Windows key + R</b> on the keyboard, type
<b>devmgmt.msc</b> to and click <b>Enter</b> open the <b>Device Manager</b></font>. Check if you see any exclamation mark or error message.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Run Windows Update to obtain the latest fixes for Windows. When this is complete, plug in the Keyboard to see whether it is installed correctly.</font></span></p>

</p><p>If you are installing on a 64 bit version of Windows 10, you might be prompted to locate the Adobe PDF file during setup. Browse to C:\Program Files(x86) &gt; Adobe &gt; Acrobat &gt; Extras &gt; AMD64</p>

<h2>            I just bought a HP G71 Notebook and can&#39;t seem to get the &#34;prt sc&#34; buttong to work, even when I use fn key plus prt sc key. Is there a setting that I have to turn on to allow the fn key to work&#63;</h2>
                    How do I turn on my fn key and prt sc key so that I can do a print screen to paste into word?

            You may need to install some additional drivers. You should go to the manufacturer website of your laptop &gt; find your laptop model (<a href="http://h20180.www2.hp.com/apps/Lookup?h_pagetype=s-002&amp;h_client=S-A-R163-1&amp;h_page=hpcom&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;submit=Go+%BB&amp;h_lang=en&amp;h_cc=us&amp;h_query=hp+g71&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP
 G71: drivers</a> ) &gt; download and install drivers which might be responsible for your keyboard.<br />
<br />
You can also make a printscreen in different way, try this: Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Snipping Tool (you can choose do you want to copy only part of the desktop, or maybe full screen by pressing arrow next to the New)

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t connect 2 monitors</h2>
                    So I got a second monitor, it is kind of an old one but it should still work, my windows 7 computer won't detect it AT ALL, I have updated my drivers, checked power, checked connection, etc etc, but it will not connect. One is a VGA port and one is a DVI
 port, I plugged the vga into the graphics card (my main monitor) and the new one into the dvi port. please help!

<p>Try one monitor at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one of the monitors is VGA only, does it work when the other monitor is not connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the "newer" monitor is DVI only, does it work when the other monitor is not connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the "newer" monitor is also capable of a VGA connection (most are), does it work when connected to the VGA port on your graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one of your computer's graphics connections uses a graphic adapter integrated into your motherboard, it's possible that the BIOS default is to disable on-board graphics when a discrete video adapter is installed.&nbsp; Check the BIOS for a setting that leaves
 on-board graphics enabled.&nbsp; </p>
