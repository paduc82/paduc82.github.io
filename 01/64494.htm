<h2>            Managing my bank details.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently phoned up Xbox live customer support about me putting my bank details on my account, however after me deciding that it isn't really safe enough on it&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they said the following; " What I will do is remove the bank details and end the subscription and get a full refund, then send you an 3 month membership code</p>
<p>in an e-mail" However at the time the code generator or something wasn't working so we ended the call. But I would really like to remove it today and do what he said</p>
<p>he could do is it all right if you could do it for me ?</p>

<p>nope</p>
<p>1st and most important thing</p>
<p>NEVER POST a SR number as it contains private info</p>
<p>2nd when you want to remove a creditcard info before the end of the term well</p>
<p>thats not how it works as that would give you a free membership for 3 months</p>
<p>no sane company would allow that</p>
<p>if you are within the first 30days</p>
<p>you can opt for 2 things</p>
<p>cancel the subscription and get a refund then you can do whatever you want with the details till you use it again to purchase a membership</p>
<p>the second is &nbsp;you can ask that the details be removed however</p>
<p>they do cancel the membership and issue a prepaid code via contact email</p>
<p>you do not get a refund for that</p>
<p>please read the terms of use when making purchases</p>
<p>as per the terms of use you are required to have an active card while a membership is purchased on the card</p>
<p>you can remove it but it can and will cancel any promotional items you receive like points or DLC if done before the promotional codes are issued</p>
<p>promotional items are only issued after 6-8 weeks after the end of the promotion not from the date of purchase</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>all billing related questions you have to be call support&nbsp;as forums people cannot verify who you are</p>
<p>and you don't want to issue private info over a public forums</p>

<h2>            Image Restore using Windows 7 Ultimate Edition EXTREMELY slow.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I really would like to submit a BUG report to Microsoft, or speak to them for free. However my product ID has expired, so here I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is something drastically wrong when I do an "Image Restore" in Windows 7 Ultimate Edition in my environment. It took over 11 hours to restore a SSD of only 50 GB. The Image Save only took 2 or 3 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a&nbsp;Sager Laptop and I'm Restoring from the Seagate drive to the SSD both on the same SATA ACHI controller.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>What I noticed:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The HD activity light flashed very shortly every 50 to 60 seconds during the Restore. Whereas the HD activity light flashed very rapidly and staying lit continuously for brief periods of time during the Image Save. Obviously the data transfer was
 slower during the Restore.</span></p>
<p><span>2. When installing the Intel ACHI drivers for the Restore, it would only accept Intel(R) ICH8R/ICH9R/ICH10R/DO/5 Series/3400 Series SATA RAID Controller drivers from iaStor.inf.</span></p>
<p><span>During a W7 install and after booting into W7, the drivers chosen by W7 were Intel(R) 5 Series 6 Port SATA AHCI Controller from iaAHCI.inf.</span></p>
<p><span>These were obtained from Intel's site "f6flpy96x64.zip Version 9.6.0.1.1014" Don't know why there isn't a consistent selection. By the way, the Restore was extremely slow without trying to install the Intel drivers too.</span><span><br />

            I had exactly the same issue and the MSFT-answer is more than ridiculous. <br />
Here is my solution: In the BIOS I switched back from AHCI-mode to IDE-mode and then it worked as expected, 3 minutes instead of 8 hours!<br />
Hope this helps some others.<br />

            Okay i thought i'd share my experience after having had to go through painful waiting hours one day before an approaching deadline of an important project deliverable with no progress on thisbuggy recovery system.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The suggestion stated by other members didnt work with my Dell XPS 9300 as it doesnt support IDE. However, out of desperation, i switched SATA mode to RAID.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The result? It worked! I didnt have to wait for days to restore a few gigabytes. The re-image process took 20 minutes only to complete.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it wasnt for you guys and your insight, there'd have been so many regrets.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And MSFT should have fired their rep who responded to this thread for his ignorant, misleading response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks guys.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Confort Mouse 6000 on MacOSX</h2>
                    Hey all!<br />
<br />
I'm a MacOSX user but I always used microsoft mouses for gaming and professional work. Recently my Optical Wheel Mouse 1.1 broke and I bought a Microsoft Confort Mouse 6000 to fulfill my tasks. However as I work with 3D software, the middle click delay is causing
 me some troubles in my workflow (pan and orbit). I installed the last driver of IntelliPoint for Mac but the delay continues. I know there are some questions about this but I can't find a fix for this. I realized that some people have the delay and some don't.
<br />
<br />
I hope you can help me with this little issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

    <title>Windows 10 stuck in an install loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in an install loop</h2>
                    I have been trying a handful of times over the last few months to install Windows 10 onto my new SSD. Originally I had tried transferring Windows 10 from the hard drive to the SSD, but couldn't because of the format of my old hard drive. I then tried to
 do a clean install of Windows 10 using a USB Drive. Everything had gone well, it gets through the install screen, but when it restarts, (if its even supposed to restart), it puts me back at the beginning of the setup rather than moving forward at all. I then
 gave up, and attempted to be content with having Windows on my hard drive. Unfortunately, when I had attempted the previously mentioned transfer, it botched up a bunch of my apps and hardwares necessary drivers and files. So I am now attempting the clean install
 method again, this time using an ISO burned onto a DVD. I backed up some important files and completely deleted everything but Windows from my computer. The setup with the disk does the same thing as the USB. Please help me g

            When you attempt installing Windows onto the hard drive, on the first reboot does the installation start from the beginning.
<br />
<br />If so this is usually caused by changing the boot order to boot form the Installation Media. On the first reboot, you must go back into BIOS and change the boot order, so your SSD is at the top of the boot order and the installation will complete . . .

            When I select the SSD as the only boot option, it does not boot at all. When I boot off of the hard drive to check whats on the SSD, it shows that Windows files have been downloaded onto the drive. When I boot using the installation media, it restarts
 the setup process.

            Hi Kurt,
<br />
<br />Do you mean you have a bootable hard drive in your system at the same time as  the SSD?

            Kurt, here is the process I use when I install Windows 10 onto an SSD
<br />
<br />Disconnect existing Hard Drive from the motherboard
<br />
<br />Connect the SSD to SATA port 1 on the motherboard
<br />
<br />Insert the bootable Media
<br />
<br />Enter BIOS and change SATA Mode to AHCI - Very Important !
<br />
<br />Change boot order to boot from Installation Media
<br />
<br />Start installation
<br />
<br />During Installation, on first reboot, change boot order so system boots from SSD
<br />
<br />Complete the installation
<br />
<br />When the installation has completed and reaches your Desktop, you can shut down and re-connect your hard drive if you intend to use it as a data drive
<br />
<br />I hope this helps resolve this issue - please check the SATA Mode in your BIOS, it must be AHCI and must be set that way before installing Windows

<h2>            Windows 10 Not getting activated after re-installing</h2>
                    I have to reinstall my windows 10 after a free upgrade because OS got corrupted. I used USB media file to setup windows 10. But the windows is not getting updated. Why is this happening. It should get activated automatically.

<h2>            Pre-loaded game not available on release date</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hello,</p>
<p>I have my xbox set on English - US setting (since I highly prefer it over Dutch). I have bought Shadow of mordor pre-order on the europian marketplace a few days ago and have since then seen it to be available on 09-30-2014. However since this morning it
 says "Buy $59,99" again. Though I have pre-loaded and bought it already. When I switch back to Dutch settings I get the message the game will be playable at 3 october. Is there a way to play it today or do I have to wait till 3 october? Also will I have to
 set my settings back to Dutch?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Hello hollidaycd,</p>
<p>When you are in Windows 7, open up the command prompt in admin mode (find it on the start menu then right click &gt; run as administrator). Then run the following command on all your drives (replace x: with each letter):<br />
fsutil dirty query x: <br />
That should list any "dirty" drives.<br />
<br />
Now, type chkntfs /x x:. The /X tells Windows to NOT check that particular drive on the next reboot. Now manually reboot your computer, it should not do a chkdsk and should take you directly to normal Windows login.<br />
<br />
Once Windows has fully loaded, bring up another admin command prompt and enter chkdsk x: /f /r. Reply Y if asked if you want this to happen on the next boot. This should take you through 5 stages of the chkdsk scan on the next boot and will unset that dirty
 bit.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>

I Followed instructions to the letter but when it attempted to run Chkdsk I again got the same error message. It refers to a corrupted disk due to a software installation package and that I need to do a system restore prior to the software installation.&nbsp; However,
 System restore tells me I have errors and cannot restore until I run chkdsk. I have no idea what software package it could be referring too. I have many. I don't reboot often and have had tis problem for a while before I found this forum.<br />

<p>That's the 32-bit Borland Database Engine that you might use if you were developing for C++.</p>
<p>
</p><p>32-bit code runs very well on 64-bit Windows. In fact, you probably have a lot of 32-bit code running on your computer. For example, all the applications in the folder Program Files (x86) are 32-bit code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: Not to worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The opposite is not true: 64-bit code can't run on a 32-bit computer.</p>

<em>Windows Recovery</em>. Third-party security software can also cause software conflict. If you do have one, I recommend that you temporarily disable it and attempt to perform a
<em>System Restore</em> again. Since you mentioned that you have already tried running the
<strong>SFC</strong> tool, I recommend running the <strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool as well. These tools are designed to check for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026529/windows-10-using-system-file-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Using DISM and SFC">support article</a></strong> for the steps on how to run both tools in Windows 10. Make sure
 that you're signed in as the administrator to complete this operation. Make sure to run the
<strong>SFC</strong> tool again after executing the <strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue remain, you can perform the <em>System</em> <em>Restore</em> using a Windows 10 installation media. This ensures that the components required to perform the operation are not corrupted or damaged. You can create a new installation media
 using the <strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>. You can get the tool from this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create Windows 10 installation media">
<strong>page</strong></a>. Follow the steps under the section: <em>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow these steps after creating an installation media:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot from your Windows 10 installation media.</li><li>Select your language preferences and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> &gt;
<strong>System</strong> <strong>Restore</strong>.</li><li>Select the administrator account and enter the necessary credentials.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>

            Hi Matthew,
<br />
<br />You can safely delete that file, it is not required by your system
<br />
<br />There are a few theories as to the origin of that file including these apps
<br />
<br />Star Wars the old republic.
<br />
<br />Photoshop
<br />
<br />Either way, lots of users have reported the END file on their C drive and have removed it with no effect to their system . . .

            Have you ran a virus scan to make sure there are no viruses on the computer? I know some programs like Photoshop will create a text file named END on the C: drive. Can you right click and open with notepad to see if it has any text in the file?

            My guess is that it's really "end.txt" and you have known file types set to "hidden". Open File Explorer, select the View tab, and make file "File name extensions" is checked. The, open the file in Notepad to examine it. Notepad cannot execute malware in files and is safe to use for this purpose.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Find <strong>Xbox</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This panel also appears when I try to open other programmes such as: Microsoft Mathematics v 4.0.&nbsp; What's the problem, and how do I resolve it?</p>

            <p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that you have received might have caused due to not having latest version of .Net Frameworks or due to any third party program/apps. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried installing the latest .Net Frameworks from Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest version of .Net Frameworks and check if it helps. This is to check if the issue is caused due to not having latest .Net Frameworks or not.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the .NET Framework 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2:</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in Clean Boot state and check if the issue persists. Clean boot will help you disable third party program/apps, so that we can check if the issue is caused due to which program/app.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>:</p>
<p>Try re-installing the Microsoft Mathematics v 4.0 and check. This is to check if the issue is caused due to incomplete installation or not.</p>

            <p>Hi Basith M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response.&nbsp; I followed your instructions, and found in Regedit under NET Framework Setup/NDP, the following list: CDF, v2.0.50727, v3.0, v3.5, and v4.&nbsp; Under v4./Release was 379893 which equates to v4.5.1.&nbsp; I then downloaded and installed
 successfully v4.5.2.&nbsp; I now get a panel for CLR error 80004005 for an application 'srptm.exe'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to Microsoft Mathematics v4.0; I found that if I Troubleshooted this application and changed the 'permissions', I had no more problems.&nbsp; I did the same for the Smartbar.exe CLR error 80004005, and it worked.&nbsp; However for the srptm.exe CLR error 80004005,&nbsp;I
 tried the change to permissions which partially worked; it works for my logon time, but then reappears after my next computer start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Deleting&#47;Moving an unused partition using Disk Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shuy_anne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting&#47;Moving an unused partition using Disk Management</h2>
                    I also have a similar question, I have 3 partitions on my Hard disk and i want to delete the other one since I am not using it.&nbsp; Here are the information's:<br />
<br />
C: <br />
Healthy (System) <br />
Capacity: 8MB<br />
Free Space: 5MB<br />
<br />
E:<br />
Healthy (Reboot)<br />
Capacity: 51.39 GB<br />
Free Space:47.98 GB<br />
<br />
D:<br />
Healthy <br />
Capacity: 97.65 GB<br />
Free Space: 18.98 GB<br />
<br />
What I want to do is to move the file on the E: partition to C: partition if possible since I won't be needing to many partitions and I did it by mistake :(. I would definitely want to keep the D: since I use it for back up. Can someone help me?
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />

            Your task is pretty complex, but you'd still be able to do it, but with some difficulties. Use this free software called
<a href="http://extend-partition.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Partition Assistant Home</a>. It has a
 Assistant will do its work. It will take some hours to complete the task so don't panic.

Thanks for the quick response. I tried the Partition Assistant Home but the only drive that allows me move/resize is my D: drive. Whenever I tried to select C: or E: the only option would be resize/move and it's not doing anything. :(<br />

            I think that what you mean is that you want to combine the C and E partitions -- you plainly can't move 3.4 GB of file into C.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the partitioning capability of tools built in to Windows is quite limited, and can't do what you want.&nbsp; You need a real disk partition management application.&nbsp; I've never heard of "Partition Assistant Home" -- but that doesn't necessarily mean
 that it isn't a useful tool.<br />
<br />
However, one of the following 3 applications should do the trick for you:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Easeus Partition Manager</a> (free)<br />
<a href="http://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Paragon Partition Manager Personal</a> ($9.95 for a 10-day trial)<br />
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis Disk Director 11 Home</a> ($45.95)<br />
<br />
There are several others as well, but you can't go wrong with any of the above.<br />

            You have a very peculiar disk layout.&nbsp; How did it get that way?&nbsp; Did you have multiple operating systems installed on this computer at one time?<br />
<br />
There are two essential partitions on a PC, the system partition and the boot partition.&nbsp; One of these contains the files needed for the computer to start up and the other contains the operating system.&nbsp; In true Microsoft fashion, Windows XP names these partitions
 the opposite of what you would expect (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_partition_and_boot_partition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>).&nbsp; Regardless of the names, in most Windows installation the system partition and the boot partition are one and the same:&nbsp; C.<br />
<br />
Before you attempt to resize your C partition (which will involve deleting or at least substantially shrinking the E partition), you need to find out the location of a few key files.&nbsp; Because you will be looking for system files, you'll need to make them visible
 in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Click Control Panel &gt; Folder Options &gt; View and make the following settings:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show hidden files and folders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNcheck Hide extensions for known file types<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNcheck Hide protected operating system files (recommended)<br />
Then click OK<br />
<br />
Where is the Windows folder located?&nbsp; (That is, is it C:\Windows or E:\Windows ?)<br />
Where are Ntldr, Boot.ini, and Ntdetect.com located?&nbsp; They should either be in C:\ or E:\.<br />

This might be because you're not logged in with administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you could have posted your screenshot earlier it would have been good. Anyways now I think your task is hard. You will not able able to combine C: and E: without doing any harm to D:. So what I would do is reinstall Windows (along with the bootloader)&nbsp;
 on E: and then after installation merge the E: and C: using PA. Then you only have to change the drive letter and it's done. Somehow get the C: out of Primary.<br />

<p><span><span>Hey CDK86 ,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to delete the power plan and create a new one and check.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To delete a plan:</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you created power plans that you no longer use or need, delete them. You can't delete any of the three default power plans (Balanced, Power saver, and High performance).</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>Warning</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>After you delete a plan, you can't restore it.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Open Power Options by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button , clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking
<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Power Options</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>If the active plan is the one that you want to delete, make a different plan the active plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Under the plan that you want to delete, click
<strong>Change plan settings</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>On the
<strong>Change settings for the plan</strong> page, click <strong>Delete this plan</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>When prompted, click

<p>
<span><span>You can create your own plan and customize it to suit your needs. For example, if you frequently use a mobile PC to give presentations, you can create a plan that keeps the display
 turned on during the presentations and ensures that your mobile PC stays awake. </span>

<p>
<span><span>If you're using a mobile PC, your plan appears under

<p>That setting is not contained within Skype.&nbsp; Skype uses the default image viewer settings for Windows.&nbsp; You can either reset your default image settings or set up different associations by file type.&nbsp; The file types that are commonly set are .png and .jpg.&nbsp;

<br />
Thank you for updating us. Are you still having difficulty with the fingerprint scan using Windows Hello? Were you able to get in touch with our Answer Desk. How did it go?
<br />
<br />
Also, have you tried going to Microsoft Store? If not yet, you can visit to any nearest Microsoft Store to have them check it for you.

<h3> aragonbattlebone  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to get my Fallout 3 &#40;xbox 360 game on xbox one.&#41; save so I can mod it to give myself nearly max special stats.</h2>
                    <p>So I bought Fallout 3 for xbox 360/one. (says it on the box.) But I've always wanted to get max special stats (or up to 9 then collect the bobble heads.) And I've looked at some resources to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a very amateurish modder but I think I can do it. But just in case could someone explain to me a few things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. how do I get my Fallout 3 save game off my xbox one... Currently it just says "Reserved Space." and if I want to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What modding tool should I use or will Notepad++ do it. or some other dedicated save editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. once I got the save what file type should I convert it to. To make editing easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. how to convert it back and put it back into my xbox one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. and how to get it to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help with this... I already got all the Trophies on my old PS3. So it doesn't really matter if I get achievements on my xbox profile. But it would be nice anyways since I'm playing mostly vanilla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you I look eagerly to your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. (I got a USB. Winrar, Notepad++, Daemon Tools Lite. etc so I think I got everything. But if you know a better tool I could use please let me know.) ^_^</p>

            Since modding is a violation of the code of conduct/terms of service, that's not something that we can help you with.

<h2>            Latest Windows Update - windows now reports its WAN address rather than its LAN address on my LAN</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent update, my windows 10 machine now reports the WAN IP address rather than the LAN IP address on all networking within the LAN.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance prior to the last update, if I SSH to a Linux box on my network, it reported it's assigned IPA.&nbsp; After the update, it now shows that the SSH is coming from my dedicated WAN IPA.&nbsp; I'd like for the machine's dedicated address to be reported otherwise
 it masks potential attacks, which will come in through the router.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to get this set back ?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t set Windows Live Mail store folder to network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I just upgraded our store with all new Windows 8.1 PCs and a new server running server 2008. I just finished setting up our email accounts in WLM and I tried to change the store folder to a folder called "email" that I setup on the Server but WLM won't
 allow me to save it there. Any ideas how I can save my emails to the server? Thanks.</p>

            <p>No, you can't get Windows Live Mail to use a store folder on a network drive. You won't have much success using a common store folder anyway; the program is designed as a single-user application. For example, account settings are kept in the store folder.
 Stored passwords are included, but they are of course encrypted. The encryption key is derived from the user profile, so this would fail for anyone other than the one that set up the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did you hope to achieve by having the store folder on the server? Perhaps there are other options that might do the same.</p>
