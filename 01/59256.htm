            Some updates do require a reinstall. But if you are on a WSUS server you have a GPO controlling everything, so ultimatly you need to ask your systems administrator as they can change all those functions with group policy.

<h2>            Windows 10 and app store problem-can&#39;t make purchases</h2>
                    After upgrading to windows 10, I am not able to make any purchases in the store. I tried updating my credit card info, and even tried changing my password. I can download and install free stuff, but I can't buy anything. I am the system Admin. Any thoughts?
 Thank you

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</p>
</span>
<ol>
<p>
</p><li><strong>Runtime Broker is using too much memory </strong>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Runtime Broker is a Windows„ÄÄprocess in Task Manager that„ÄÄhelps manage permissions on your PC for apps from Windows Store. It should only use a few megabytes of memory, but in some cases, a faulty app might cause„ÄÄRuntime Broker„ÄÄto use up to a gigabyte of
 RAM or more.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If„ÄÄyour RAM use is high and your PC is running slowly, an app may be the cause of the problem. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to„ÄÄopen Task Manager and then, on the
<strong>Processes</strong> tab,„ÄÄcheck to see how much memory Runtime Broker is using. If it‚Äôs using more than 15% of your memory, you probably have an issue with an app on your PC. To stop Runtime Broker from using so much memory, select
<strong>Runtime Broker</strong> in the list, select <strong>End task</strong> to close Runtime Broker, and then restart your computer.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1</p>
</span>
<p>Step: 1 Uninstall and try reinstalling the app and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists try method 2, </p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
</strong>
<p>Run built-in Windows Store app troubleshooter.</p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>a. Click on Start search and„ÄÄtype troubleshooting and choose 'Troubleshooting'
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>b. Click on 'View All'.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>c.„ÄÄRun the Windows Store apps troubleshooter. (Right click on the built driver file.)
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>d. Click/tap on <strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong>. And check if it helps.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<strong>
<p>Method 3</p>
</strong>
<p>If the issue persists run SFC scan and check if it helps.</p>
<strong>
<p>Summary</p>
</strong>
<p>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed,
 or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</p>
<p>System file check works on Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1, and win 10„ÄÄ<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the„ÄÄsteps provided,„ÄÄin the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></span></a></p>

            It's really frustrating. I'm unable to take advantage of the 10 cent app sale. Trying all weekend, now it's almost over and I missed out. I even installed updates, restarted multiple times , did everything suggested. I defend MS all the time, love Windows
 10, and use Windows Phone. Come on, MS. Help!

<h2>            natural reader program wont run</h2>
                    I have bought this program, which when first installed gave administrator errors,when installing a voice,&nbsp;it wont accept the key code and fails to run, I suspect it is to do with my system set up and not the program itself, but after changing to administrator,uninstalling
 under administrator,and re-installing,&nbsp;the problem still remains. Any ideas anyone.&nbsp; (Win 7). Thanks.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent a week trying to fix the program, but to no avail, the software company have suggested to restore the documents file to 'default' to fix the problem. This does not work.</p>
<p>I have now re-installed&nbsp;the program&nbsp;again, and when I get to install the voice, I get error 1406, relating to permissions.&nbsp; The end result is the same, the key code box keeps re-appearing blank after I enter the code and try to execute the program.&nbsp; So it
 looks like the problem is due to my set up. Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            Enforcement website is turning in a loop after accessing to a request of info from Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Since last&nbsp;Friday, my husband has no access to his microsoft&nbsp;account. Apparently, he has been banished permanently without real explanation. He went to xbox.enforcement.com to open a review Saturday. And this morning, he has received an email from Microsoft who said that we need to go to enforcement website to clarify some points. He&nbsp;can&nbsp;see that Microsoft needs&nbsp;info but when he ties&nbsp;to click on the link, the website go to the first page of enforcement website and explains us that we have to give some info by following the link "Need Info" again, and again, and again.&nbsp;It's like the website are in a loop or something similar.<br />Do we have any other options or support to help us. This is the first time this thing happened since 12 years of activity with Microsoft and it&nbsp;starts to be very annoying.<br /></p><p>Please, help... :'(</p>

<p>My is doing that same and the harder the xbox works the faster the clicking is, Could it be from the hard drive because its clicking all the way to the end when you shut it off. It gets louder and quieter as it jumps in action some little thing has to being
 in their I tried blowing air that you use on computers to get the dust out of them and it wont quit. F%^ its really annoying. Sony is way better then Microsoft hands down they gave me golden service. My PS4 bricked first day I got it from Amazon on 14 and
 now this, But my PS4 is back already since bricking. I received it on the 14 got the repair box on the 15 and shipped it that same day which they paid for overnight on the box to me and back, shipped PS4 on the 15th and got the brand new one on the 16th. ***
 Microsoft we would be working on my number right now if I would have called on the 14th.

<p>Hey vllsutiger23,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clicking sound doesn't sound like a fun issue at all my friend. By any chance do you have the console standing up or laying on its side? Since there are no issues with the console its still disturbing to hear. I believe its the hard drive making that
 noise. Now I heard that there is nothing really wrong besides the noise but if you want a replacement HDD you can contact phone support and you can get the disk drive replaced.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach out and let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Like many of you, I had the same issue. It was a very low clicking noise that got increasingly louder as I played Battlefield 4. The system ran fine, but the noise (similar to the sound of a cricket) was driving me nuts. I did an advanced exchange and got
 my new system today. The sound cannot be heard on the new system. It could have been something very simple like a wire that was in the track of the fan blade.

<h2>            UWP apps not communicating with Internet while the charger is plugged.</h2>
                    <p>This might sound a little strange, but since 14390 I've been having this problem.</p>
<p>Some of my Universal Windows Apps are not communicating with Internet when the charger is plugged, even though I have both WIFI and LAN attached.</p>
<p>Here you can see some pictures with the charger attached<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bd1f5fd-7cef-4c83-a062-e5e0f3e9725c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bd1f5fd-7cef-4c83-a062-e5e0f3e9725c" height="434" width="772" /></a></p>

<p>And here's what happens when I unpluged the charger</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1ac73f9-dae6-4493-8aca-6dd6994cc088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1ac73f9-dae6-4493-8aca-6dd6994cc088" height="437" width="779" /></a></p>

<p>Right now I'm on 14393.67, waiting for 14901 after yesterday's flight.</p>
<p>Although I got to say that essential services like Windows Update and Feedback Hub are working fine even with the charger plugged in, while Cortana looks dead if I have to look for something online</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bda3e15-cc10-4420-93d0-2f51789a41bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bda3e15-cc10-4420-93d0-2f51789a41bb" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25601c92-67e1-4427-a63f-756cdc3f4a1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25601c92-67e1-4427-a63f-756cdc3f4a1e" height="287" width="510" /></a></p>
<p>Even using Fiddler to trace requests I wasn't able to better diagnose the problem or find a solution.

<p>I hope someone will help me with this.</p>

<h2>            Skype Android headset microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>With the new Android app, whenever I connect a headset to Skype - either wired or bluetooth - the app still captures the audio through the built in speaker-mode microphone. This does not happen during normal phone calls, which leads me to believe there's
 a problem with your app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this intended? Can I fix it myself, or do I need to wait for an update?</p>
<p>

<h3> rong78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - 64 bit gets black screen on startup with mouse cursor moving</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem on an HPE-500f running W7 64 bit in that I get a black screen on Windows startup (although I do get a colored section soon after startup showing that Webroot Spyware has started).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hard drive failed and I just got it back with new drive
 and have just finished updating all Windows updates, etc. when this problem started.&nbsp; So far, here's what I've tried for troubly shooting:</p>

<p>1. I've tried restoring the sytem to restore points as far back as is shown (and before the problem started).
</p>

<p>2. I've also tried to restore the "bootsect.exe" code but that was also unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Also tried running "chkdsk" as suggested in another thread for similar problem back in September.</p>

<p>When I called HP (hard drive failed under warranty so could call since it was just replaced) their only suggestion was to restore to original factory settings....meaning another two to three days updating Windows, etc. from last March.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions other than restoring to factory settings? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            Thank you for your quick response.
<div><br />
<div>I actually found a solution browsing old threads last night. &nbsp;Here are the approximate instructions given to a request from SNiPeiTOut responded to by JohnD in July 2009 (the problem could be a 3rd party program or service starting in the background and
 preventing the desktop to load properly):</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Boot in SAFE mode</div>
<div>- Click the Start orb and type "msconfig" in hte Search Box and press Enter</div>
<div>- On the General Tab click Selective Startup</div>
<div>- Under Selective Startup click the box labeled "Clear the Load Startup Items"</div>
<div>- Click the Services Tab</div>
<div>- Click the box labeled "Hide All Microsoft Services"&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Click the option labeled "Disable All"</div>
<div>- Click OK</div>
<div>When prompted, click the Restart option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I did this my PC booted to the current desktop configurations. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
There are additional instructions in the July 2009 thread to find out which program or service is causing the problem (basically you try booting with half the programs and by trial and elimination you add/delete programs to the startup until you've determined
 which program is causing the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, this worked for me but other threads cautioned that "black screens" are very difficult to fix and problems/solutions are not as well understood and documented as blue screens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your reply.</div>

 scan my computer for viruses, i did that already and it's virus free.

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing you need to do is find out what graphics card you have-&nbsp;Press (<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>). Select ‚Äú<strong>Device Manager</strong>‚Äú. Under the ‚Äú<strong>Display Adapters</strong>‚Äù menu, you should see the name of your graphics card.
 Attempt to upgrade its driver from within Windows, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, go to its manufacturer‚Äôs website to manually apply the driver yourself. It‚Äôs also a good idea to upgrade any other outdated drivers in your system and to use Windows Update to upgrade
 your operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, check Microsoft Help articles: </p>
<p>This&nbsp;article contains the download link to the troubleshooter to prevent Windows 10 from overwriting your graphics drivers:

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying so quickly. I forgot to name my graphic card before. I have an Nvidia Geforce 745m and I updated the driver a few days ago with the geforce experience program. So when i tried to update the driver through Device Manager, it said that
 the driver is up to date. But i also have an intergrated graphics card, an Intel HD Graphics 4600. So I updated the driver for that card and hopefully it fixed the issue.</p>

                    It won't run the recovery either. I even tried the disks. It just continues to reload after it freezes but never loads all the way.

            <p>I had the same problem, it is the video driver that was corrupted on install. Is there some way to selectively install the drivers like old windows did. The name of the file is evident when it hangs on safe load.&nbsp; How can a person get to the file system
 to change the driver.&nbsp; I have tried all types of usb&nbsp; boot ups but they will not access my large drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can the file system be accessed from a command prompt or skip that particular sys file???&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1 No I can't boot to desktop</p>
<p>2 Yes I have tried repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single boot option hangs and eventually recycles to restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the computer because I can run other operating systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does exactly as stated in the first post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what I need to do is to rename the sys file and then it will not hang, and then repair but I have not figured out anyway to get access to the disk.&nbsp; Any dos program will not access my drive and neither will any of the other usb boot programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember in old windows you could single step through each item and load or ignore it. If I could do that I could step around this bad sys file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have access to another computer to hook up the drive to or I could just rename the file that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present I am going to try and get XP on a&nbsp;flash drive&nbsp;and see what I can do access the drive from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also It does the same thing if a person boots from windows repair disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was updating windows and it was at the video driver when my screen went blank, so with all of the evidence it is most likely a corrupted sys file without any way to access the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Chuck</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2012 does not work after 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Windows 10 performed an upgrade on my laptop when I didn't ask it to, I had not noticed that I had to tell it not to perform the scheduled upgrade - still, aware now for our office computers, as our Sage accounts software does not support Windows 10. Watch
 ! the pop ups still keep coming even though you tell it not to do a scheduled update. How do you kill it all together ? as it has screwed up my Windows Live 2012 e-mail, I can not send or receive and get error code 0x800C013E - has anyone a fix ? I have uninstalled
 10 and gone back to 7 but mail does still not work - Help, how can Microsoft be allowed to release this rubbish on an unsuspecting public !!

            <p>I am having the same problem that others are having after reverting back to Windows 7 from Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 WLM was very slow and I had to login each time I opened WLM and some accounts didn't receive any mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I reverted back to Windows 7 WLM I had to clear over 2,000 messages &nbsp;some were entered two or three time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I &nbsp;open WLM now WLM Storage Recovery "Recovering The Windows Live Mail Database." &nbsp;The recovery window takes two or three minutes before I can review my new mail.</p>

<p>It looks as if many of&nbsp;those who revert to Windows 7 from Windows 10 experience a corruption&nbsp;of the store folder (the folder where messages, calendars and account settings are stored). Depending on how complicated your store folder is (many accounts,
 many calendars, many messages in many folders), it may be simplest just to create a new store folder and repopulate it:</p>

            I am been traveling for the last two days. &nbsp;I read some place on one of the threads that once WLM is uninstalled that there could be registry errors because some files have to be rename. &nbsp;I do not mind trying your suggestion but I don't want to add additional
 problems with WLM and the registry.

            <p>I uninstalled WLM 2012 twice. The last time I left it alone for a couple. I also used Windows Fix It Tool to verify the uninstalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost all all my mail in each account. The accounts did not require a special set up or password. WLM works fine now. No problems with deletions now. I have my old Mail on my iPhone and desktop.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Simon
<br />
<br />Everyone is reporting this at the moment . . .
<br />
<br />This is a bug introduced in the latest Windows 10 update, rest assured there is nothing wrong with your drive(s) . .. 
<br />
<br />This generally indicates that OneDrive sync has not fully uploaded you files - you can check that from the OneDrive icon on your Taskbar.
<br />
<br />Most likely there is nothing wrong with OneDrive sync either, hopefully Microsoft will resolve this in a future update

<p>Windows uses icons for system from a .dll file, each icon is given an identity number such as -189 for drives which is the icon to use for file explorer when showing drives (just an example), I use custom icons for drives and don't get the red X in any display.</p>
<p>I should think the last windows update simply changed the icon number reference, a Friday programming error.:)</p>
<p>It doesn't affect the working of the system however just the display.<br />

<h2>            DMA2200 with Windows 7</h2>
                    I see Netflix and InternetTV buttons on my PC media center;&nbsp; however, these are not available on my TV.<br />
I bought LinkSys Media Center Extender DMA2200 after consulting the microsoft windows 7 compatibility center.&nbsp; While the extender connects to my PC, there seems to be no traffic from the internet to the extender.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hello Mtwilfer007,</span></p>
<p><span>As you can see Netflix and InternetTV buttons on your computer media center, then the problem might be with your cable connection on TV, check
 if the connections are correct on your TV.</span></p>
<p><span>Also I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Netflix application and check if it works fine. To do so, please follow the steps mentioned
 below:</span></p>
<span>To uninstall or change a program</span>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Open Programs and Features by clicking the </span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span> button, clicking
</span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong><span>, clicking
</span><strong><span>Programs</span></strong><span>, and then clicking
</span><strong><span>Programs and Features</span></strong><span>.</span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a program, and then click <strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. Some programs include the option to change or repair the program in addition to uninstalling it, but many simply offer the option
 to uninstall. To change a program, click <strong><span>Change</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Repair</span></strong>. <span>
&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span>For more information, please refer to the link mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>We understand that you have consulted with compatibility center. However, the extender is not compatible with windows 7. Here is a link to check
 the compatibility.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=DMA2200&amp;type=Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=DMA2200&amp;type=Hardware</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you have selected Xbox 360 under windows firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on start &gt; Control Panel go to Windows Firewall. On the left hand side of the window click on Allow a program or feature through Windows
 Firewall, make sure Media Center Extenders is selected.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, you can refer to the links mentioned below, which gives you all the information on about media center extender.</span></p>

<h2>            How to change the screen Windows Media Center starts in when using extended displays&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have an HP Laptop Pavilion DV6 connected to an external HP LP2475w screen that is set as my main display, however when I start WMC it opens up maximized on my laptop's screen instead of my external monitor... is there some way to change this?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!<br />

                    I get this error code randomly when I'm using my computer. I just built this computer, all my drivers are updated and I'm using latest versions of Windows 10. Wondering how I can prevent this error. When I try to compress the file it says I need special

<h2>            Windows 10 1903 Centrino Drivers Deactivated on Reboot</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading a 2013 HP Pavilion laptop to 1903, its Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 #2 network card started having issues. Specifically, after a restart the drivers would malfunction, and the only way I've found to fix the issue is to run the Intel Proset/Wireless
 Software 'Repair' feature after each restart. After doing this, the wifi works well, with no other issues until rebooting again. The issue began only after upgrading to 1903.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>-Rebooting the PC (how I found the issue)</p>
<p>-Installing the latest Intel drivers</p>
<p>-Repairing the drivers using Intel Proset/Wireless Software</p>
<p class="contentStandard">-Running "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" in cmd line as administrator (no issues found)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on the issue would be great, and I'd be happy to answer questions if need be.</p>

            Hi Zwetsche 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download and install the last drivers for that WiFi card released by Intel
<br />
<br />Due to the data on that driver (10/1/2017) I would presume Intel now consider that device to be legacy and while those drivers will work in earlier versions of Windows 10, I think from version 1903 onwards you may have difficulty getting a reliable connection with that WiFi card
<br />
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/59471/Intel-Centrino-Advanced-N-6205-Dual-Band" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/59471/...</a>
<br />
<br />If that driver is not successful on your system, it may be time to shink about replacing that WiFi card, those are available from $5 on the Internet . . .

            Thanks for the quick reply! I will definitely be looking into getting a new wifi card with ongoing support.

<p>I've already deleted the library database as suggested in some of the forums, also disabled Media as a Win 7 feature rebooted and then re-activated it.&nbsp; I've also unplugged the external and rebooted that as well, I'm also getting the same error with a cd

<h2>            &#34;not all files were copied&#34; error code 0x810000f in Win 7 backup</h2>
                    <p>When I ran Windows 7 (Professional) Backup and Restore on my Samsung Series 5 laptop PC using an
<u>empty</u> external hard drive (I had even formatted it not using the quick format)&nbsp;and letting Windows choose what to back up I got the message that the backup had completed but that not all files were copied. Clicking on Options, this showed a message "E:\BACKUPS
 already on target"; E is the drive letter of the external hard drive. The error code is shown in Details.
</p>
<p>Backup has since run again several times and each time the same message appears.
</p>
<p>I deleted some test files from the C drive on the laptop and restored them from the backup without problems.
</p>
<p>(What is perhaps slightly different in my case is that the hard drive of my laptop also contains Windows Virtual PC and in that Virtual Windows XP. I'd be interested to know how Backup and Restore handles that. )
</p>
<p>Has anyone come across this behaviour? Any ideas? </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
<p>Michael</p>

<h2>            Couple random BSOD on new machine with Windows 10 1903</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I completed my build 3 weeks ago and I've had a couple BSOD. The first BSOD was during a game and I didn't even get a full memory dump. The second one was right at bootup and I did get a memory dump however error was a generic (IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL) error
 which I've listed below. I'm not overclocking anything and I'm using the drivers that were installed with Win10 1903 except for the Radeon driver and the latest AMD Chipset drivers. I've also run multiple passes of memtest86 and Windows Memory Test without
 error. I'm thinking about disabling Windows Fast Startup because I think it might be part of the issue. Any other suggestions of things to look for?</p>

            Hi BitGamerX to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The crash looks to be caused by Memory corruption.
<br />
<br />Probably caused by : memory_corruption
<br />
<br />
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<h2>            Why does my Recovery Partition take up so much of my HD&#63;</h2>
                    Hi! I've read that Windows 7 create a 200 MB Recovery Partition but when I looked it up on the Disk Management on my laptop, it says that my Recovery Partition takes up 20.63 GB. My laptop only has a total of about 120 GB and if possible, I would like
 to reduce the size of the Recovery Partition and instead add it onto my regular storage. Is that possible? If it is, what's a safe method to do so? Thanks in advance!
                </div>

<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
Those are two different partitions. <br />
<br />
The 200 MB Recovery Partition helps boot and repair Windows.<br />
<br />
The 20GB partition has a backup of Windows, and can reinstall Windows if needed. <br />
<br />
Do not make any changes to either partition.<br />
