<h2>            Can&#39;t refresh or reset my pc</h2>
                    <p>Ok i have tried allot but i'm all out of ideas so i'm asking for help from you guys.<br />
<br />
first things first, the problems began after a random white screen crash. after the crash my pc became noticebly slower, all the apps stopped working completely, bittorent can't download other third party programs can't download from the internet.</p>
<p>i tried all the reperation kits from microsoft, all of them notice corruption none of them can fix them. so i decide to refresh my pc buuuuuut.<br />
pc setting won't open because it's a **** app and my apps are broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now i have to refresh the old way by pressing f9 (i have an asus) and refreshing it there. after i tried that my windows drive seems to be offline.<br />
so then i CMD -&gt; diskpart -&gt; sel disk 0 -&gt; list partition -&gt; create partition efi -&gt; doens't work. also i can't select partition 0 if i have an partition 0.</p>
<p>can't create partition efi because i don't have enough space i think. ( i haven't tried resizing any partitions because i'm scared or ruining my pc even more, also i have 8 partitions what up with that). so i decide to take the safe way and install linux
 so my pro computer dad can fix all my problems. but my American megatrends bios and UEFI setting are completly BS and i can't boot off from USB/CD/DVD. also F10 (and F12) don't work. i've tried disabling secure boot and fast boot but to no avail<br />
<br />
here's a video of how my bios looks like, i can't even figure it out neither can my dad. also there's nothing usefull in the usb configurations option.</p>
<p>http://www.mediafire.com/watch/zs421sedi9262oi/VID_20150301_224949.mp4</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now what do i do?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>to answer the questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) my computer works and i can get to desktop ect, i just can't use any apps and download stuff by using 3rd party programs like bittorrent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) when i acces pc settings (or any other app) it just crashes to desktop. you can still see an empty icon in the toolbar. (i'll show a pic)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) no errors where shown at the white crash. my screen just went blank, my tolbar was visible.</p>
<p>i waited for 10-20 minutes before i used forced shut down. after that the problems began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used DISM and got the&nbsp;0x800f0906 error. after internetting some more i've found that is have to use windowsupdatediagnostics to fix it. i'm now using it about 100 times and everytime i use something different gets fixed. don't know how long this proces
 will take</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: windows store works again and pc settings has got it logo back, it still doenst work and continues to CTD</p>

    <title>Windows Maps vs. Microsoft Streets and Trips - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybercat_ind  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Maps vs. Microsoft Streets and Trips</h2>
                    I travel the country in my RV. As a full time RV'er, I also communicate with others who do the same thing in various Facebook groups. A common complaint is the demise of Microsoft Streets and Trips. Many of us still use the 2013 version, as we search for
 a suitable substitute. Nothing really compares, not the Maps app in Windows 10, or BING maps, or programs offered by others. I've tried many, and they just don't have the functionality. We need something that we can use to plan trips, and it needs to be as
 easily modified as Streets and Trips was. It needs to be useable offline, without having to download each state separately. I'm aware this should be addressed directly to Microsoft, but was totally unable to do this at the Microsoft website - if your questions
 don't fit what Microsoft anticipates, there is nothing that allows you to submit a new question - just FAQs that don't hit the mark.

<p>Itunes 10, Windows 7, IE9 Beta, had virus scan, pop-up blocker&nbsp;&amp; firewall off, added apple.com to all the site exclusions I could find (about 3 I think), cleared cache, deleted cookies &amp; browsing history, refreshed browser, disabled add-ons, restarted computer,
 looked everywhere I can think looking for the ports apple needs to communicate&nbsp;with my CPU (can't find them), going in circles with apple and microsoft because I don't know what the problem is exactly (except I can't&nbsp;download &amp; install an upgrade, can't download,
 can't restore my iPod) <strong>OR</strong>&nbsp; what question to ask, or steps to take. I work nights and no internet at home so not available to call anyone for help. I can download song purchased, I can buy apps for iPod and download &amp; install them, but updates
 sometimes hang up &amp; won't install. Oh this happened before I upgraded to Win 7 32bit too so it's not just Win 7, I don't think.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 taskbar flashing</h2>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVGVAI6yWa4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using antivirus programs but none of them are detecting anything and it still happens in safe mode.</p>
<p>It gets really annoying trying to use chrome or play games like this so I would appreciate any help.</p>

            <p>Hello ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, taskbar is flashing when ever you open a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Unable to open the you tube.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Is the whole taskbar that flashes or the icons on the taskbar flashes?</span></li><li><span>If only icons are flashing, does the </span>icons of all the applications flash? Or is it any particular application icon that keeps flashing?</li><li><span>Have you made any recent changes on your system prior to this issue?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists try method 2,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method</strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;2: System File Checker.</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><br />

<h2>            How to disable Pinch Zoom in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Pinch Zoom in Windows 8<br />
</p>
<p>I've spent hours of my life trying to find an answer for this question, and every "it's so easy!" tutorial has a tab in their mouse panel that I don't have. This is what my mouse settings look like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df6f5870-9406-41c5-b2c9-3ac68f6b50e5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no magic last tab that has the pinch settings in it, and I would really dearly love to turn the pinch zoom off. I'm using an Asus X551 and Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jammie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly, follow these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
Try installing the latest Windows 8.1 driver for your touchpad then checking the settings to disable pinch to zoom.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may download the latest touchpad drivers for Windows 8 from this link:
</span><a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=Touchpad&amp;os=30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=Touchpad&amp;os=30</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, you might need to reinstall the touchpad drivers and then try to disable pinch to zoom setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
You can also try this option:<br />
Go to the Taskbar at the bottom of your screen and click on the up arrow to ‚Äúshow hidden icons.‚Äù Then open ASUS smart gesture, unclick the Zoom box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 Creators Update, Power Options are Missing&#47;Unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Yes this is a copy of a post but I have the same issues and I have tried the exact same things, can some please offer some assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to the Window's 10 Creator's update, clicking on the power icon from start results in the message: "<em>There are currently no power options available</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted the following to no avail (rebooting as needed per each attempt):</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed power plan (both to a different preset and to a new custom plan).</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>gpedit.msc</em>&nbsp;and ensured&nbsp;<em>User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar</em>&nbsp;was not enabled.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>regedit</em>&nbsp;and created a registry value for&nbsp;<em>NoClose</em>&nbsp;with the value 0 at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>sfc /scannow</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt; no issues found.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>powercfg ‚Äìrestoredefaultschemes</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt; I did get an error at 99.0%&nbsp;<em>Error: 0x800f081f - The source files could not be found</em>.

<p>After updating to the Window's 10 Creator's update, clicking on the power icon from start results in the message: "<em>There are currently no power options available</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted the following to no avail (rebooting as needed per each attempt):</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed power plan (both to a different preset and to a new custom plan).</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>gpedit.msc</em>&nbsp;and ensured&nbsp;<em>User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar</em>&nbsp;was not enabled.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>regedit</em>&nbsp;and created a registry value for&nbsp;<em>NoClose</em>&nbsp;with the value 0 at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>sfc /scannow</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt; no issues found.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>powercfg ‚Äìrestoredefaultschemes</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<em>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</em>&nbsp;from an admin command prompt; I did get an error at 99.0%&nbsp;<em>Error: 0x800f081f - The source files could not be found</em>.

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will help you in resolving the issue you are facing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before assisting you further, I would like to ask you few questions regarding the query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you upgraded your PC to Windows 10?</p>
<p>Are you facing any issues related to the Windows 10 OS?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are sorry to inform you that you cannot rollback after 1 month of Windows 10 installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you upgrade to Windows 10, the previous Windows files and folders are automatically stored in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder. This folder is kept by Windows only for one month. After one month Windows 10 will automatically delete the folder. So you can restore previous Windows version only within one month after Windows 10 upgrade. Also if you
 run Disk Cleanup in Windows 10, make sure to uncheck "<strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong>" option. If you don't uncheck it, Windows will delete all files and folders present in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder and you'll be unable to rollback to previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are here to assist you any issues pertaining to Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Have to close the lid of my laptop twice to put it to sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since I upgraded my Windows 10 installation to Fall Creator Update I am facing a strange issue. When I want to put my laptop to sleep, I have to first close the lid, which only turns of the screen and does nothing else in the background, open the lid - now
 I am back exactly where I left of without any login screen or anything else and then close the lid the second time, after which the laptop enters sleep normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never faced a similar issue and I have no idea how to troubleshoot it. I have tried searching for new updates in Windows Update and I updated my Intel graphics drivers, but there was no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system specs:</p>
<p>Dell XPS 15 9550</p>
<p>Intel i7-6700HQ</p>
<p>nvidia GTX 960m</p>
<p>Windows 10 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Vladimir</p>

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />If you want to try to fix the problem, try the following:
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not agree that this is a hardware issue. I do not have troubles waking up the computer from sleep, on the contrary, getting it to sleep. Closing the lid is most likely just interpreted to operating system the same way as pressing a sleep button on the
 keyboard after which the OS is in some way responsible for it. Moreover, it worked just fine before upgrading to the Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest drivers for my chipset, graphics and other components as well as BIOS up to date. Returning back to older version of Windows is not an option for me and resetting BIOS is also not something I would like to mess around with right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any other ideas, especially some ways to debug why Windows is not reacting to the first Close Lid prompt, I would be happy to hear them.</p>
<p>

<p>I have a small update on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now pretty sure the issue has nothing to do with closing the laptop lid itself, as the problem is the same when I try to put the PC to sleep using the button in start menu. Every time I want to put the laptop to sleep, I need to press the sleep button
 twice. The first time always only turns off the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking into Event Viewer to see f I can find anything that could help me pinpoint the issue, but I had no luck with it.</p>
<p>I also tried to disable hibernation and fast boot, but it had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas what to do about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Please confirm if you are looking for the Scanjet 932C or Deskjet 932c drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are is a list of Scanjet and Deskjet printer drivers from HP.</p>
<p><a href="http://h20566.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.PAGE/public/psi/selector/?javax.portlet.tpst=867000c4cf25636cc859bfdeb053ce01&amp;javax.portlet.prp_867000c4cf25636cc859bfdeb053ce01=wsrp-navigationalState%3D_queryText%25253Dscanjet%252B932c%25257CimplicitModel%25253Dtrue%25257C_op%25253Dfind&amp;javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&amp;javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20566.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.PAGE/public/psi/selector/?javax.portlet.tpst=867000c4cf25636cc859bfdeb053ce01&amp;javax.portlet.prp_867000c4cf25636cc859bfdeb053ce01=wsrp-navigationalState%3D_queryText%25253Dscanjet%252B932c%25257CimplicitModel%25253Dtrue%25257C_op%25253Dfind&amp;javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&amp;javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to Deskjet 932C printer, then download the Windows 8.1 drivers from
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=60096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=60096</a>&amp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unplug the printer, remove any HP printer products installed on the computer&nbsp;before you install the drivers from the above website and plug in the printer when the installer process asks you to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

            HP seems to have stopped offering the full software/driver download for my HP Deskjet 932c printer directly from&nbsp;their website.&nbsp; You can only get the basic driver now.&nbsp; I have the original 1999 installation CD for the printer.&nbsp; Its setup.exe won't run
 even when I try the compatibility troubleshooter utility in my new desktop PC that's running&nbsp;Windows 8.1 64-bit OS.&nbsp; Also, even when I right-click on the setup.exe file and open the properties dialogue box, and&nbsp;change the compatibility&nbsp;settings to be compatible
 with Windows 98, and check all of the other boxes too, for some reason, Windows 8.1&nbsp;is only willing to go back as far as XP Service Pack 3 when I rerun its&nbsp;compatibility utility.&nbsp; Am I using the compatibility utility wrong?&nbsp; If I choose Windows 98 from the
 drop-down menu in the compatibility tab of the Properties dialogue box for the printer's setup.exe, why won't the compatibility utility run the CD-ROM&nbsp;using&nbsp;Windows 98

                    I'm on build 10532 and I've just noticed that the Photo app is crashing about every 15 minutes when it's running as the screensaver.&nbsp; I was using photo gallery for the screen saver in a previous release and had to stop using that because it kept crashing
 and it still does, even on a preview. In that release the Photo app was working OK as the screen saver but now it seems to be OK in preview and when it kicks in but then it fails 15 minutes later and repeats this failure about every 15 minutes.

 that blue screen from showing up. I hope my computer doesn't have a virus in it. I have McAfee that isn't picking up any problems. I'd appreciate any help I can get. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it is a new computer you should check with the Seller and Acer Support for replacement or warranty
<br />
repairs. Remember the more you do the more they will claim it is something you have done. Added even<br />
if you would were able to some how solve the issues you would still want it documented in case of further<br />
issues down the road.<br />
<br />
================<br />
<br />
If you really want to troubleshoot the issues which I DO NOT recommend in this case : (Wasting time<br />
will only delay how quickly the Seller and Acer Support start to help solve the issues and it may even<br />
prevent a replacement or other efforts they might make if a timely notice was given.)<br />
<br />

    <title>Clean install of windows, failing updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clean install of windows, failing updates</h2>
                    <p>I apologize in advance, this may be a little lengthy. I recently just changed out most parts in my PC because I was having some freezing issues. My computer would freeze at random times, it didn't seem to have anything to do with the load amount. My previous
 build was</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Thermaltake Core V71 Tower</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">MSI 990FXA Gaming Motherboard</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">AMD FX9590 CPU</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">EVGA GTX 970 (4GB)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">2x 8GB GSkill DDR3 Ares 1866</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Corsair H100i GTX (v2)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">EVGA 850 Watt Bronze PSU</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Samsung 750 EVO 120GB SSD</span>&nbsp;(C Drive / Windows Installation)</li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Kingston 60GB SSD</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">WD HDD Blue, 750GB</span> (WD7500AALX-009BA0)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the Motherboard, CPU, GPU and RAM. The new build is</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">ASUS Strix Z270E Gaming Motherboard</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Intel I7 7700k CPU</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">GIGABYTE GTX 1080 G1 (8GB)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">4x 8GB GSkill TridentZ DDR4 3200</span></li></ul>
<p>Plus all of the previous parts, just replaced the parts mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first install with the new parts, windows installed and then drivers from the motherboard and GPU disk , then I updated windows with no errors.</p>
<p>After the first day, the freezing came back although I don't know if it's the same issue, it was a little different this time and I started getting some BSODs. I decided to clean my hard drives and do a full re-install of windows and the drivers. After installing
 windows and the motherboard drivers, upon trying to update windows I keep getting errors. It will go through a list of updates to download and install in windows update until it finally gets to a "feature update to windows 1703". During the reboot for this
 update, it will get to about 5% configured and then my pc will power off completely for about 5 seconds, and come back on. During windows loading it restores to previous windows version, reverting updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since cleaned the hard drives multiple times to try fresh installs, though they all do the same thing. I've tried it on the Samsung SSD and the Kingston SSD alone, both with all parts uninstalled except for Motherboard, CPU, one stick of RAM, water
 cooler, PSU, and the lone SSD. All return the same error. I've updated my motherboard bios as a last resort from 0906 to 1009 but nothing changed with another clean install. I'm at my wits end and don't know what else to try. I've tried updating using the
 Windows Upgrade Assistant and just windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of the errors I'm getting while updating:</p>
<p>"0xC1900101 - 0x2000C</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during APPLY_IMAGE operation"</p>
<p>"0x80070652"</p>
<p>There were a few others that I didn't manage to get a picture of purely out of frustration and retrying the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide any additional information if needed, and any help is greatly appreciated :) Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: At first install with new parts I was overclocking slightly, CPU and RAM set to 3200 MHZ with XMP profile. Since cleaning the drives and trying to install multiple times I've had Motherboard settings on default, no overclocking on anything.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be due to the hardware changes made. It could be an issue with certain peripherals which triggers the errors. To resolve your concern, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which of those error messages is the most recent error on the device?</li><li>Are you still getting BSODs?</li><li>Which build version is your Windows 10 currently on?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I believe the first error I listed was the most recent.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"0xC1900101 - 0x2000C</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during APPLY_IMAGE operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had a BSOD since cleaning the drives and trying to do a fresh install. We'll see once I get past this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe my windows is on 10240. When I open the upgrade assistant it says I'd be going from 10240 to 15063.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just in case, here's a list of my peripherals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corsair K95 RGB</li><li>Steelseries Rival 300</li><li>HyperX Cloud Revolver (Unplugged since drive cleans)</li><li>I have speakers (will check brand/part number when i get home in a couple hours) going through a Sabrent audio USB adapter (Unplugged since drive cleans)</li></ul>

<p>LOL io ho il problema opposto.</p>
<p>Vediamo se si pu√≤ risolvere il tuo.</p>
<p>Vai nella schermata MULTIGIOCATORE e poi su BROWSER DEI SERVER.</p>
<p>Premi lo stick destro RS e ti fa vedere i vari filtri dei server.</p>
<p>Guarda sulla destra c'√® la preferenza della regione da cui scegliere il server e dicci dove hai il segno di spunta ammesso che tu lo abbia.</p>
<p>Se non c'√®, mettilo su Europe e poi torna sul browser e premi X per aggiornare la lista.</p>
<p>Ora quelli che vedi sono solo server europei e dovresti avere 5 tacche di connessione (la barra sulla destra).</p>

<p>Scrivo quanto riportato da Wikipedia per il lag.Cosi non rischio di sbagliare a scrivere qualcosa spiegando a parole mie.</p>
<p><b>Lag</b>&nbsp;√® un termine inglese e vuole dire "ritardo". La parola LAG coincide anche con l'abbreviazione dei termini LAtency Gap, che sono termini che indicano sempre una differenza (gap) causata da latenza delle informazioni (latency). In realt√† l'origine
 del termine non √® sicura in quanto fa parte dello Slang inglese. L'uso del termine √® principalmente diffuso in ambienti legati al gaming online e via<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LAN</a>.</p>
<p>Nel caso specifico di&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">internet</a>&nbsp;(e di computer in&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LAN</a>) questo termine √® utilizzato al fine di indicare negativamente
 il tempo di scambio di dati fra due&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">computer</a>&nbsp;che avviene in tempi troppo lunghi rispetto a quelli desiderati.<br />
In particolare il lag √® considerato fenomeno estremamente fastidioso nel caso si verifichi durante&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LAN-party</a>&nbsp;o in generale durante una partita&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">multiplayer</a>.
 Questo in quanto nel caso in cui il tempo di comunicazione fra due computer sia estremamente alto (oltre i 100 ms), l'esperienza di gioco pu√≤ divenire estremamente frustrante: si possono verificare fenomeni quali vistosi scatti delle immagini su schermo o,
 nei casi pi√π gravi, errori di connessione tra i due computer.<br />
Si parla di lag anche relativamente ad IRC: quando infatti il server dovesse avere problemi di connessione, per esempio per un sovraccarico di banda o per un attacco&nbsp;<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DoS</a>, esso
 invia i dati con ritardo ai client od agli altri server cui √® connesso: ci√≤ causa di conseguenza agli utenti di vedere in ritardo i messaggi ed i mode convogliati al canale, perdendo, con fastidio ma molto spesso anche a loro insaputa, la principale caratteristica
 dei programmi di chat e messaggistica, ovvero l'istantaneit√†.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happened:</p>
<p>1. Troubleshooter could not find any problem</p>
<p>2. system file checker did not find a problem</p>
<p>3. I created a new test account as suggested. On the start menu, the placeholders that I showed in the screenshot of my own account are not there, apart from a few like Shazam, Flipboard, Candy Crush Saga, Farmville 2, and Twitter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Twitter actually opens and runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other when I click the tile give me a pop up dialog box saying "You'll need a new app to open this ms-windows-store"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click "all apps" all of the other in-built modern UI Windows 10 apps are there but they are greyed-out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg. Weather, Sports, Photos, People, News, Mail, Camera etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on any of these I get a dialog box saying "This App Can't Open. There's a problem with &lt;app name&gt;. Contact your administrator about repairing or reinstalling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to pin them to the Start Menu, the tile appears there but greyed out with a small "!" icon at bottome right of the tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows store icon responds slightly differently. When I click it, it briefly flashes up a window like it is going to start, then it disappears again and nothing else happens. There is no error message or dialog box displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[UPDATE] - after I signed off, then signed back in again with the test account, most of the modern apps were OK including the Microsoft Store. However there were about 3 or 4 that were still "greyed out". However when I clicked on them I got an error message
 telling me to go to the Store to repair/reinstall and after I did that they are all working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems on the test account the Modern Apps are all OK, but on my original account there is some problem.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After doing some searching I came across a knowledge base article that mentioned about problems in Windows 8 (I have Windows 10) with modern apps not starting because of some problems with file permissions and/or registry permissions

            <p>I have had similar problems with not being able to open any apps.&nbsp; I found that it was because I was not listed as an administrator.&nbsp; Try going to the Control Panel, under User Accounts select Change Account Type.&nbsp; I was listed as having a Standard account.&nbsp;
 When I changed it to an Administrator and restarted, all my apps and the Store opened up without any problems.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 backup problem -- video folder does not fully backup&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 backup and not all the files in the Video folder are backing up.&nbsp; It is selected in the "backup these folders" section, but only a couple folders and files are actually backing up despite having hundreds on my C drive.&nbsp; What can
 I do to fix?&nbsp; thanks

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup may not have completed the process, or that some of the files are corrupted or damaged, etc. For us to isolate the issue in backing up videos, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your device prior to the issue?</li><li>Did the backup finish the process? If so, are you able to see the videos when restoring from the backup?</li><li>Are there any error messages that appear when backing up the files?</li><li>Have you checked if your device is updated?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

            I did everything you suggested. Nothing worked. Rather than wait further, I used the windows 7 style backup instead. Slower but at least it works.&nbsp;
