<h2>            Windows 7 will not boot after Nvidia Display Error</h2>
                    
<p>I have found similar issues relating to a security update on other sites but have had no luck with any of the suggested work arounds. Also the issues are at least a year old and very specific to updates that were known to be bad.</p>
<p>Two days ago I received an error message that the display had failed and recovered and that everything was working fine. Then a few mins later the monitor screen went completely black.</p>
<p>After restarting my PC I noticed that I had vertical blue lines running through the display but everything was booting up like normal. Then the next screen which normally shows a list of devices and the boot devices as it goes through the verification process.
 This screen did not have the blue vertical lines but instead in the areas normally black it had every space filled with commas or other punctuation marks.</p>
<p>This did not phase the PC at that point because it continued like normal and went to the Windows logo splash screen, however the blue vertical lines were back.</p>
<p>Windows began to load up and then the screen flickered and went black again. I gave it a couple mins thinking that it may just be taking a bit. 20 mins later however still nothing. I then restarted again this time disconnecting the power cord from the PC
 after turning it off first. I know in the past that cutting the power after turning off the PC has been the trick.</p>
<p>10 mins without power and still not working. The interesting thing was that when I booted back up this time the blue vertical lines were gone as were the punctuation marks on the device list screen. But it still hung up at the loading windows logo screen
 with the screen going black.</p>
<p>I went to Nvidia's forums, other hardware and software forums, and even the Window's forums to see if a similar problem existed. Low and behold there were countless issues with similar problems all relating to software updates and compatability issues. Well
 I've been running Windows 7 since you could get it retail and none of the explained causes were applicable, but I decided to attempt the solutions given.</p>
<p>Well I've reset the BIOS by removing the battery. I've attempted to restart in Safe Mode with F8 (which I can't get to by the way). I've also attempted to boot with a disc in the CDROM, including the windows 7 install disk. I've checked to make sure that
 heat is not an issue and have even attempted to boot with the case off.</p>
<p>The one thing that keeps popping up and does not matter which I select is that I can either run a Start Up Recovery or Start Windows Normally. Both result in the same thing, a black screen shortly after the logo screen.</p>
<p>The card that I am using is a Nvidia 8600 xfx card and I have been using Windows 7 Pro 32 bit for the OS.</p>

<p>A small update just in case someone has a suggestion for me to try. It has now been a solid 24 hrs since I had last attempted anything and turned off my PC. I turned it on to see if there was anything else that I may not have tried already.</p>
<p>Well the blue vertical lines and punctuation is back, however I was able to boot up into SafeMode and SafeMode with command prompt. I have restarted a number of times to verify this in the last 10 mins.</p>
<p>I am currently running a Malware and Antivirus scan to see if that is in anyway related. I also plan to do some additional troubleshooting and will post back on my findings and check for updates.</p>

<p>Still no luck. Malware and Antivirus scans came back clean. Still seems to be loading just fine in SafeMode.</p>
<p>I am going to attempt to disable the driver for my video card again a Nvidia 8600 xfx to see if that is the issue.</p>
<p>I have looked on the Windows 7 Site forums and it was suggested that the card my not be compatable with Windows 7 but if that was the case I wouldn't have been able to use Windows 7 all this time with the card in my PC.</p>
<p>I'm contemplating to just go back to Win XP Pro which I had been running previously.</p>
<p>I had also seen some say that it may be an issue with the number of applications that I had running and I can't even get into normal mode and I at the most had a total of 5 applications to my knowledge at any given time running.</p>
<p>I noticed also in the forums that a lot of people had mentioned that they were running an online game application when the problem first started for them. Funny enough I had been playing World of Warcraft (WoW) when this first happened to me as well.</p>
<p>Since I can not get into normal mode I am unable to try the setting changes for the game suggested in that Thread either.</p>
<p>I'll check back to see if anyone has some feedback and post an update.</p>

<p>Ok, after a few attempts I have determined that it may be an issue with the driver from the Nvidia card. I am able to load windows in normal mode after completely removing Nvidia drivers and software from the PC in SafeMode.</p>
<p>The issue I have now is I am unable to catch the automatic update that Windows 7 does reading that the card is a new device which installs the default driver from 5/14/2009. I am currently attempting to download the most recent released driver set from Nvidia's
 site before resetting the computer to "update my changes" from installing the "new" video card.</p>
<p>I'll keep updating as I progress.</p>

<p>Another update and yet more issues to stack in the mix.</p>
<p>So one success I have had so far is to set the display adapter to a default VGA display. The biggest issue I have with this is that none of the applications I use on a regular basis, prior to this issue, will work now. I continue to get an error message
 about not being able to "Find a suitable display device. Exiting Program."</p>
<p>The other problems I am having relate back to the issue with blue vertical lines in the display, which now seem to be consistant and the punctuation marks on the device list and boot screen.</p>
<p>I have attempted to combat this by digging out a different monitor but alas it is not the monitor going out like was suggested on another forum I have read in the mean time while attempting to fix this issue.</p>
<p>So to recap:</p>
<p>*I am able to get into Safe Mode with the Nvidia GeForce 8600 GTS xfx and most current driver and previous driver versions working properly save the blue vertical lines in the display.</p>
<p>*I am able to get into Normal Mode with either completely deleting the device driver and Nvidia software from the PC in Safe Mode and restarting, but Windows updates it as soon as I log in and have to restart to continue. Still have the issue with blue vertical
 lines in the display as well.</p>
<p>*I am able to get into Normal Mode with the display set to a default VGA display adapter, but I am unable to load many applications due to error with suitable display device not being found. Also continued blue vertical lines in the display.</p>
<p>Any further suggestions would be appreciated, I'll continue to browse the net and online forums as I finish up day 3 of working on this issue.</p>

<p>Just wanted to post my dxdiag since apparently most forums and web boards have asked for this information. Trying to get this solved seems more involved than simply whipping the hard drive and starting fresh. Just need to dig out my XP discs now and see
 what I can come up with.</p>
<p>Note: Yes I know it says that I'm using a default VGA display adapter but that setting was the only way I can get display.</p>

<p>It's been a long trip to solve this one. Going a month without a computer and having put so much time and effort into repairing the issue with so many similar issues reported all over the internet and none of them with a clear explaining of how they solved
 them and even more with the issues still unsolved leads me to think that there is some serious issues out there with manufacturers today and their bull headed requirements for updating.</p>
<p>None the less, I was finally driven to the point of simply doing a complete wipe of my hard drives using DBAN which from what I understand is the most comprehensive wipe possible. This issue still eludes me as to what was the cause and since the internet
 community which is so full of experts who all point the finger in at least 12 different directions I'll tell everyone how I solved the issue.</p>
<p>Wipe your hard drive and start over, I know it is extreme and sucks for those with no way of backing up important files since the last time it was done. Alas it is the simplest way to save yourself a headache and the same amount of lost time that I have
 had.</p>
<p>Also, don't bother with the tech support of the hardware manufacturer or software companies. I spent countless hours on hold while they researched the issue, transfered me to another level of support, and then gave up with the promise of a call back only
 to not be. I heard the same thing I don't know how many times where one tried to pass the buck onto another saying that one thing was not compatible only to have them turn around and say that it was. None of them including supervisors could tell left from
 right and another word of advice talk to the tech because the supervisors are even worse at being completely useless. For every tech that gave up and transfered me to a supervisor I ended up with a supervisor not even knowing the basisics, and when I did get
 a supervisor that could understand they ended up not even bothering to try anything past the sub par troubleshooting steps that had already been done previously.</p>
<p>I'll be attempting to re-install windows tonight. Here's to hoping that for some unseen reason starting over from scratch won't work. If that happens I don't know what will happen other than maybe sell off the parts and get a MAC. God I shutter at that thought.</p>

<p>Hi Jesthon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is now equipped with Digital License, that doesn't require you to enter a product key. Activating Digital License will only apply if you will upgrade from an older version of Windows. As for upgrades, if you are prompted for update, there will
 be no prompts for any key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check out this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/d4efb316-79f0-1aa1-9ef3-dcada78f3fa0/get-the-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for more information about how to update
 to 1703 build (Creators Update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to let us know.</p>

<h3> dehalley  say:</h3>
<h2>            The server &#123;8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820&#125; did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</h2>
                    This morning, when I checked my System log, it was filled with errors, all saying:<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The server {8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.<br />
<br />
A quick search of the registry revealed that this identifies Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). I looked and sure enough, it was stopped. When I tried to start it, I got the error message:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not start the Windows Management Instrumentation service on Local Computer<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error 193: 0xc1<br />
<br />
All the help I can find on the subject assumes that the application doesn't have the required permissions. Nothing has been deliberately changed. I attempted to do a system restore to several previous days control points and got&nbsp;messages that it could be done.
 So, I verified that all the required permissions were still in place.<br />
<br />
My operating system is XP Pro SP3 with all updates applied.<br />
<br />
So, I have to say that something broke, perhaps as part of one automatic update or another. Now, when I try to run Microsoft Update, it just hangs.<br />
<br />
There may not be anough information here, but I'm looking for some help in troubleshooting. I have system tools enough to report complete configutation information if needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Although I had run a chkdsk /r on my system drive and it came up clean, I decided to run a sfc scannow and found 3 dlls that were in some way not original. After these were restored, the errors have (so far) stopped. While it's only been 30 minutes, that's
 the longest I've gone with no error messages all day. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

<h2>            Problemas com valida&#231;&#227;o de Gamescore na Live do Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Olá, estou tendo um problema chato, as conquistas que eu deveria ter ganhado nos games, não estão sendo validadas, mesmo após concluir o objetivo, a conquista não libera, consequentemente não ganho o Gamescore, esse problema estar acontecendo no ReCore, mas tambem no Minecraft Windows 10 Edition, Phantom Dust e outros games, SOMENTE jogos como o Microsoft Mahjong,&nbsp;Microsoft Solitaire e derivados estão dando Gamescore.<br /></p>

<p>
<br /></p>

<p>Já fiz dezenas de processos e passos que aparecem nos foruns de ajuda, como verificar se estar devidamente conectado a Live, verificar as conquistas no TrueAchievements, resetar a Windows Store, deslogar da Live, desinstalar e re-instalar os games, resetar o cache da loja, E&nbsp;NADA... (nem mesmo o suporte sobre solucionar o meu problema)<br /></p>

<p>
<br /></p>

<p>Quem puder me ajudar a resolver esse problema, ficaria grato, até porque esse problema chato, me desanima a comprar outros games na Windows Store, já que nada que eu faço registra de fato.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>p.s. Estou postando tanto nos foruns do Windows, quanto nos da Xbox Live<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>p.s² Não tenho Xbox One, somente Windows 10 PRO</p><p><br /></p><p>p.s³ Antes as conquistas funcionavam normalmente, esse problema é de meses pra cá, tanto é que tenho conquistas registrada no ReCore de um tempo atrás, atualmente tanto o ReCore quando qualquer outro jogo, não registra mais.<br /><br /><br /><strong>[translation]<br /><br /></strong></p><p>Hello, I'm having a boring problem, the achievements I should have won in the games, are not being validated, even after completing the goal, the conquest does not release, consequently I do not win the Gamescore, this problem is happening in ReCore, but also in Minecraft Windows 10 Edition, Phantom Dust and other games, ONLY games like Microsoft Mahjong, Microsoft Solitaire and Derivatives are giving Gamescore.</p>

<p>I have already done dozens of processes and steps that appear in the help forums, such as verifying that you are properly connected to Live, checking achievements in TrueAchievements, resetting Windows Store, deleting from Live, uninstalling and re-installing games, resetting the cache store, and NOTHING ... (not even the support on solving my problem)</p>

<p>Anyone who can help me solve this problem, I would be grateful, even because this annoying problem, discourages me to buy other games in the Windows Store, since nothing I do actually records.</p>

<p>p.s. I'm posting on both Windows forums and Xbox Live</p>

<p>p.s² I do not have Xbox One, only Windows 10 PRO</p>

<p>p.s3 Before the achievements worked normally, this problem is from months to now, so much that I have achievements registered in ReCore a while back, currently both ReCore and any other game, no longer register.</p>

<p>Bonjour à tous,</p>
<p>je tiens à mettre votre attention sur un message que je viens de recevoir sur le xbl.
<br />
<br />
</p>



<p>je lui ai donc envoyé un mail et ait reçu un formulaire à remplir (cf ci-dessous)</p>


<p>La chose qui m'a mis la puce à l'oreille est la demande du mot de passe.... bizarre bizarre.</p>
<p>Je lui ai donc demandé quel mot de passe il voulait. Un nouveau? celui du compte?</p>

<p>Et voici sa réponse.</p>
<p>"<span>Oui c'est le mot de passe du compte Xbox Live, malheuresement nous n'avons pas d'autre alternative car nous n'avons pas accès à vos compte depuis notre base de donnée, seule la branche américaine de Xbox y a accès, c'est donc le seul moyen que nous
 avons pour les inscriptions.</span></p>
<div><br />
<div>Néanmoins, si vous avez un anglais correct vous pouvez contacter le service client Xbox par téléphone qui pourra vous inscrir sans prendre votre mot de passe, mais vous devez maîtriser un minimum l'anglais.</div>

<div>Cordialement."</div>

<div>j'ai donc contacté le support client qui m'a indiqué que la demande de mot de passe n'était jamais demandée par Microsoft (ce que je ne doutais pas) et qu'il fallait prévenir la communauté de ces agissements sur le forum pour que cela remonte et que, si
 possible, des sanctions soient prises.</div>
<div>Attention à vous car maintenant, avec votre CB rattachée à votre compte, si on vous le pique, c'est la cata (dépôt de plainte, opposition CB etc etc).<br />
<br />
Bonne journée</div>

            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p />
<p>Merci de ce signalement, j'ajouterais que toute communication officielle venant de Microsoft sur Xbox Live, se fait par l'intermédiaire d'un message ayant pour expéditeur "Xbox Live" et uniquement ce nom, qui plus est, Microsoft et/ou la division Xbox, ne fait <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>JAMAIS</strong></span> ce genre de proposition via un message Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Les communications officielles se font soit par mail à l'adresse du compte Microsoft, soit par courrier.</p>
<p />
<p>Et encore une fois, Microsoft ne vous demandera <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>JAMAIS</strong></span> votre mot de passe, les services internes tel que la PET, (Policy Enforcement Team),&nbsp;peuvent accéder à votre compte sans avoir besoin de votre mot de passe.</p>

<p>Coucou</p>
<p>J'ai eu encore des nouvelles de sa part...</p>
<table>

<tr>

<div>Si notre but était de voler des comptes, je n'aurais conseillé à personne d'appeler le support pour avoir confirmation.</div>
<div>Mais si tel est votre choix c'est comme vous voulez, je trouve même ça très intelligent de votre part, car c'est vrai il faut bien avouer que c'est inscriptions laissent clairement à désirer.</div>
<div>Vous avez raison de donnez jamais votre mot de passe.</div>
<div>Mais je souhaite quand même vous prouver que notre démarche est officielle.</div>
<div>Appelez nous &nbsp;au&nbsp;<span>u 0800 915 274 et demandez David ou Marceau.</span></div>
<div><span>Ils vous confirmeront tous les deux.</span></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Comme quoi, il ne doute de rien...<br />
<br />
Le plus inquiétant est (selon ses dires) que 40 personnes lui ont fait confiance cette semaine.<br />
<br />
Je lui ai quand même fait remarquer auparavant que le vol de comptes (et oui, une carte bancaire est associé à celui-ci...) et l'usurpation d'identité étaient puni par la loi.</p>
<p>Mais bon, le mieux est que personne ne se fasse avoir (c'est le but d'une communauté non? ;) ).<br />
Ce qui est dommage est que microsoft ne donne pas beaucoup d'informations sur les choses que ne demanderont jamais le support Xbox comme:</p>
<p>- le mot de passe</p>
<p>- les noms et prénoms</p>
<p>- l'adresse email</p>
<p>- le numéro de téléphone</p>
<p>- l'adresse</p>
<p>les 4 derniers pourront être demandé uniquement en vérification pour savoir qu'ils ont le détenteur du compte au téléphone uniquement après avoir envoyé un code sécurisé pour avoir accès au dossier.<br />
<br />
Bon week end a tous</p>

<h2>            &#91;Help&#93; Sync Center not syncing anymore in Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm using a laptop and PC both Windows 10. I share the Desktop of my laptop to my PC through Sync Center, it used to work however it takes an extremely long time for the network files to come online. However, currently, no matter how long I wait, Sync
 Center does not Sync anymore. I need help most of my school work are done using my PC because it's hard for me to do it on the laptop. It will be convenient if this issue is resolved. I've checked my sharing options and it's all turned on, I don't understand
 why it's not working. Please, help my offline network files are always offline and cannot be synced.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Yuren, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issue as such can be a result of some changes in the configuration settings related to
<strong>Sync</strong> <strong>Center</strong>. To provide you the appropriate steps that can resolve your concern, we'd like to verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the overall size of the files that you're trying to sync?</li><li>What's the type of the files that you're trying to sync?</li><li>How does the Sync Center configured on your device? For better understanding, we'd like to request for a screenshot of it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Frequent Network Connection Loss and Dropout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _joeyjabbour  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frequent Network Connection Loss and Dropout</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past couple weeks now, ever since I have updated to this version of windows 10:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Version 10.0.17134 Build 17134,</strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing a network issue that completely has me baffled. At a random instance, my computer's network would freeze, and the Wi-Fi icon would change from&nbsp;<em>connected</em> to
<em>connected, no internet</em>.&nbsp; When I would try to go into my adapter settings to disable and enable the adapter to fix said issue, file explorer would not open the proper location where I could do so. I have searched online for the past couple hours, and
 this is what I have done in an attempt to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Reset WiFi Network Settings and it's defaults (Unfortunately, only worked for a day).</li><li>Changed power management settings (I soon figured out that this was NOT the issue; my computer's power management is working just fine)</li><li>Changed the Network Profile to which I am connected to from public to private.</li><li>Searched for any updates that would require my network driver to be upgraded [None that I have seen]</li><li>Checked for any normal windows updates [None].</li><li>Ran multiple diagnosis' on different levels of the situation (Ran adapter issues, network issues, i.e.)</li><li>Checked the device for improper function ["This device is working properly"]</li><li>Checked my anti-virus for any firewalls that could intentionally mess with my network and it's settings</li><li>Checked for any viruses on the computer</li></ul>
<p>As a rising computer enthusiast, I am quite unsure of what to do next. It would be much of a help if anyone could shed some light on this circumstance, or if anyone shares the same predicament I am currently in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone who requests this, this is the computer specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Model: HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC x64-based</p>
<p>Processor :Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz, 2601 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)</p>
<p>

            Hi ADarkShadow 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Looks like you have already tried most of the things. Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network Adapter &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />

<p>Oh I thought I was the only one having this issue recently minus the freezing, never happen to me.</p>
<p>I troubleshoot all the same like you and no avail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I found the culprit which is the Location Service</p>
<p>If I turn that on, connection goes wild and keep disconnecting</p>
<p>I turn that off and everything is fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can try turn that off and hopefully fix like mine</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how many times someone reports your son. As long as your son doesn't violate the

Code of Conduct</a>, nothing will happen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If they find, your son violated the Code of Conduct, a suspension will be issued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like saying "There are so many football hooligans destroying shop windows and rioting through the city, and my son who tipped over that car and lit that trash can on fire got arrested by the police."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your son got an Enforcement suspension, then he violated the Code of Conduct, and the Enforcement Team has the evidence to prove it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please educate your kid to NOT engange in "using some words", when these words violate the Code of Conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your kid gets harassed by other kids, educate your kid to NOT respond, but to report these messages and block the offending kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, as a parent, go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for you're answer.</p>
<p>I have spoken with my son.</p>
<p>There was someone who harassed my son and he reacted on him. I think it is all the time the same person and he know that my son will respond on him.</p>
<p>I told him not to respond amd report his messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will help for him.</p>
<p>His account is added as a family account.</p>

            Windows update time taken depends upon many factors like your internet speed, status of windows update components, presence of other softwares on your computer etc. 
<br />
<br />3 hours is a reasonable time. As per my experience, a computer, in general, gets updated in 1.5 to 2 hours for 1803 (exceptions will always be there)

            Hi Marinel,
<br />
<br />Yes that is quite normal, 1803 is basically a re-write of the Windows OS and that can take time
<br />
<br />During these updates, your user profile files are moved to a temporary user profile and all installed applications need to be checked for compatibility
<br />
<br />Then most files in Windows need to be replaced
<br />
<br />All of this can take time
<br />
<br />I upgraded my new laptop last week, what I did was download the latest Windows 10 ISO from the Microsoft website and used that to upgrade my system
<br />
<br />That way, the whole upgrade process was done and I was back at the desktop in 15 minutes having successfully upgraded, it is a much faster method for these bi-yearly feature upgrades . ..

 that it needed Microsoft.Net/Framework ??? which it installed and all is OK, all the programs I had the issue with now run fine.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Rob</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 slower internet</h2>
                    <p>I've just upgraded to Windows 10 Home and my speed went from around 30 Mbps to 1-10 Mbps if i"m lucky.I'm using Vodafone Mobile Broadband with a modem Huawei b310 which is a wi-fi that uses a cable to connect to the pc and that rarely gave me any problems.I
 also tried booting into safe mode with networking to see if the problem persists and it did.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also important to mention my router isn't shown in network,nor does it show i have a wi-fi connection.Could that be the problem?</p>
<p>I've set my internet profile to private,quit the background apps,i'm pretty sure i uninstaled one note but not sure on how to check since i had to index everything from my D: partition,and i didn't index my C:(i only use C: and D: as partitions).I thought
 i didn't have to do it,but&nbsp; when i checked to see a game that was instaled on D: it didn't show.</p>
<p>I also tried almost everything from this link https://saintlad.com/slow-internet-on-windows-10/,except for gpedit.msc(Windows cannot find).</p>
<p>I also installed the latest version of Realtek PCle Gbe Family Controller for Windos 10.(I know it doesn't say wi-fi but it's the same network adapter that gave me a fast internet connection).Tried Network Adapter with similar results.Since the problem appeared
 in Windows 10 and persisted in safe boot with networking does that mean that one of the drives or services that are working in that mode are causing the issue?</p>

<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.

<p>thank you for your fast response i did all the steps ,besides i think most of them i had already done once or more times,in my wlan report it says i don't have a wireless network interface(been trying to find how to attach the file but can't find it,only
 insert hyperlink and image) ,still i know it should work fine even without it,since i have been using this router for roughly a year.My humble opinion is there is some sort of glitch between my operating system and my modem or its configuration.I just don't
 know where.</p>
<p>Another question:if my network had a name(besides Network that is)would it be the name of the SSID(because that would be the name of my router).</p>
<p>And another question(i've checked but just to be sure):does Windows 10 Home support WPA2-PSK security mode.I heard that changing the encryption to tkip might fix but i don't think i have such a option, i did check.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I am eager to update to Windows 10, however I have read somethings that are holding me back. I recently read this on the Microsoft website however I can no longer find it. "<span>We

 me but I would like to keep my personal things personal. Please feel free to redirect me to links for peace of mind.</span></p>

            Yep. This is being reported in just about every news outlet in the world. So, do you think Microsoft&nbsp;is any different than say AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Google, Yahoo, your local government, all world governments, etc, etc, etc. See where I'm going with
 this? Face it, its the world we live in. The days of communicating by wires and&nbsp;tin cans and smoke signals are long gone. Alexander Bell would be so proud of what we've done to ourselves, yes?

<h2>            Flashing screen when unplugged&#47;Remove Driver</h2>
                    <p>My son has an Asus TP550L. When it is unplugged the screen flashes. We have tried several fixes, one of them is to remove the monitor driver. We have tried this several times, removing it using the control panel as well as deleting the driver through device
 manager. However, the driver keeps re-installing itself. The driver is Intel HD 5500. I worked with Intel but they said there was nothing more they can do, that I needed to talk to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I try next? In the end, the ultimate want is to not have the screen flicker when off battery, the driver removal is just a proposed solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            You have a crash. Upload all the dmp files from your Windows\Minidump folder to your Skydrive and post a link here, so that we can look at the dumps.

<h2>            ERROR&#47;BSOD&#63; The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.</h2>
                    So i've been experiencing alot of BSODs lately, and i recently had this error from the last BSOD. I've done alot of troubleshooting and went to the device manager, cmd(admin), did a dsim healthrepair, and from all the BSODs i've had this is the first time
 I had this from event viewer:<br />
<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x00000133 (0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000501, 0x0000000000000500, 0xfffff8017ba6b378). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 73b5cc59-bd54-4938-b34e-5c41f27ec6b3.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me solve this issue?

            Hi mrcplbrnb, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi mrcplbrnb,
<br />
<br />All the mini-dump files point to your Qualcom Atheros Network adapter device driver as the culprit behind your BSOD's
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website and download the driver they recommend
<br />
<br />Then uninstall the current driver and install that driver . . .       
        </p>

            I went to the asus website<br />
<br />
https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-14-X442UR/HelpDesk_Download/<br />
<br />
and I am not sure which to download.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also from what I understand, you're telling me to:<br />
<br />
1. go to device manager<br />
2. uninstall qualcom atheros network adapter<br />
3. then install those provided from asus(which?)?

            Now i am more confused, uhm there is a listing of 2 Qualcomm Atheors LAN Driver and Application LISTED UNDER WIRELESS(which can be expanded). Sir you told me to download "Network adapter device driver" and not "bluetooth" please confirm.
<br />
<br />
Just wanting to make sure cause i don't want to experience more BSODs :(

                    <p>Hey All,</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm sure a lot of us have this issue with this game. I wanna just say I really do like this game and it's one of the very few games that I wanna get 100% on. &nbsp;However 4 of the achievements that I have tried to unlock are stuck at 100% locked..I've tried everything you can imagine from hard booting my system, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, waiting 72 hours for the cloud to catch up with my saved data, tried getting some of these achievements again...so on, so forth. &nbsp;I believe that my Cloud save data is corrupted unfortunately Microsoft has zero way of retrieving that data to fix the corrupted one. &nbsp;Does anyone out there have any idea how this is going to work or is anything going to change?</p>
