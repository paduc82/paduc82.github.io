<h2>            Microsoft or Mega-problem</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been a paying costumer for ten years. Why allow your Xbox 360 to be overcome by hackers and J-Tagged consoles. I have called you about this issue many times. My disk drive is now broken due to the malicious attacks by both hackers and
 persons using J-Tagged consoles. The only help I have received from Microsoft about this problem is many hours lost on the phone with Microsoft employees that tell me they can set up a repair for my console. This repair would be for the exchange of $109.00
 plus tax in U.S. dollars, that I and countless others would have to pay for. I have the money to repair my console but will not be charged twice. I have paid for the account to be a "Gold Account", and will not pay to have my console repaired when Microsoft
 dose little if anything to stop hackers and J-Tagged consoles. This is a problem, with many people in the same situation. You have the costumer pay for what the hackers and J-Taggers do on your service. You do nothing about the problem that is effecting many
 account holders accept charge the costumers for repairs for a console that will end up having the same issues. This is not what I see as fair business practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have purchased a one year subscription card for a "Gold Account" for use with Xbox Live, only two months ago and this will be my last transaction with Xbox Live. I will not purchase the new Xbox One, due to the problems that preexist on
 the Xbox 360, that you seem to do nothing about. Actions speak louder than words and your actions are to allow hackers to take from you. If you are not going to take action to help yourself, you will not take the time or effort to help your costumers.</p>

<p>You are right in that thought but hackers maybe over clocking your Xbox 360's cpu when they freeze your game! If this is true what other problems can this cause?</p>
<p>Hacking a game console is old news and the new frontier is headed for malicious attacks that otherwise never happened. GTA IV has more hackers than ever before at this point in time. Almost all game lobbies have a hacker most game lobbies have two or more.
 My console is often attacked and when that is the case my Xbox 360 console will be frozen by the hacker. Yes many say "Stop Playing GTA IV" but why, I paid for the game to play it, not put on a shelf. If I am wrong or right the fact is Microsoft does not speak
 with Rock Star about the issue and dose nothing to fix the problem with the number of hackers. You might say that Microsoft does not have the personal to fight it and if so why have people pay for a service that's just not there in full.

<p>I want this problem to be fixed! If this problem is allowed to go on the console gamer will not.</p>
<p>First we had video games then came the game hacker. Now it is at the beginning of "hacker wars" with the "hacker nuke" the stopping of other hackers or players any way they can. This evaluation will continue to evolve with no gamer in sight! &nbsp;

<p>I'm sorry but just no.</p>
<p>3 main points to reinforce this :-</p>
<p>1) Rockstars GTA4 media had a bad batch - was proven, if it you have one then get it swapped</p>
<p>2) The 360 can overheat but not overclock. &nbsp;For it to overclock you'd have to have the 360 modded, in which case, haha you modder... ban hammer.</p>
<p>3) Manufacturers put a warranty of 5 years on HDDs and 2 on Disc drives. &nbsp;They expect them to fail after this time. &nbsp;I don't know how old your 360 is so I'll stop there.</p>
<p>Heavy usage of a HDD with a defect will increase the defects until it dies, with the freezing becoming more frequent as they happen.</p>
<p>A defective disc will cause excessive reread attempts which whilst doable will put excessive forces on the drive until faults develop. &nbsp;After-all, it has a lot of moving parts, cogs etc.</p>
<p>I believe your system has issues due to either a) Age or b) Defective disc.</p>

<p>If you think microsoft is doing nothing about modders and hackers you should look around these forums a bit more. They seem to be doing a decent job and if you come in contact with one of these hackers report them and the claim will be checked. I doubt very
 much that hackers attacked and ruined your disk drive it probably just broke, its an electronic part these things happen, especially with the 360. I've had 3 systems break down and everytime I contacted microsoft and they warrantied it no problem and I had
 a shipping box at my door in a few days. If its not covered by warranty its probably a few years old and its crappy but things break, there's not much you can do about hardware failures after warranty is up, you just gotta eat the cost.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hey loom at the bright side new consoles are going to be here soon so you have the perfect excuse to upgrade, or a nice price drop on 360s possibly.</p>

<p>I have played Grand theft Auto IV ( GTA IV) with many disks on many systems I also have it downloaded to my Xbox 360 hard drive. Every disk and every Xbox system I have played offline without a problem. As soon as I play online AND my console is frozen by
 a hacker, this is when my system starts to get buggy. The problems that accrue are having trouble singing in to Xbox Live soon as I restart my console, the disk drive of the console I am using will not read the GTA IV disk (but will read any other disk in
 good condition), the disk drive opens as soon as the disk tray is closed (as long as it is GTA IV is in the disk tray), a few hours of random loss of internet connection no matter the location, receiving many message from the hacker telling me "I told you
 I would hack you!" only with more colorful choice words, much time spent using my console to file a complaint on the hacker, clearing my system cache, going into my console hard drive deleting corrupted files that should not even be on the system soon after
 the console is hacked, and a few that did not make it on this list.</p>
<p>You may be right about the over clocking of the Xbox 360's cpu you may be wrong, I would only like to find an answer to this problem, instead of reading a reply that is rude, not well thought out, by a person who replies not because they are helpful but
 only judgmental to their own ego. ( LiB MK2) I never wrote that the console is over clocked I wrote "You are right in that thought but hackers maybe over clocking your Xbox 360's cpu when they freeze your game! If this is true what other problems can this
 cause?"</p>
<p>&nbsp; "I want this problem to be fixed! If this problem is allowed to go on the console gamer will not. First we had video games then came the game hacker. Now it is at the beginning of "hacker wars" with the "hacker nuke" the stopping of other hackers or players
 any way they can. This evaluation will continue to evolve with no gamer in sight!" I wrote that because I have always loved video games. I have been on a lifelong path to make video games. If hacking is not going to be stop, it will only get worse and many
 people like myself will see that game development is dead. Microsoft is doing all it can with the resources they have, but this is not enough. Some of the hacking done is considered a federal crime and Microsoft must do more!</p>

<p>GTA IV, Red Dead Redemption are both full of modders/ glitchers</p>
<p>Rockstar don't patch their games, they just move on to the next title. You should complain on the Rock star forums about the people using glitches in their games. BF3 glitches are patched regularly, but GTA IV is an old game.</p>
<p>I used to love playing red dead, I don't bother now, and I put Rock Star games on my avoid list, LOL</p>

    <title>Unable to select 1920x1080 resolution. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to select 1920x1080 resolution.</h2>
                    <p>After a restart a few days ago my PC is suggesting that 1024x768 @ 60hz is my native resolution.</p>
<p>As I know this is not the case (I have had a 1920x1080 display for years and it has worked perfectly) I used DDU to have a clean install of my gpu drivers (nvidia) and changed and my HDMI cable, but to no avail. Suspiciously, nvidia control panel views my
 monitor as connected via DVI, which it is not, and windows is running a generic php driver for it. I have since installed the&nbsp; generic windows flat panel 1920x1080@60hz driver, I was hoping this would fix it but it didn't change a thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of ideas. Anybody have any experience in this bizarre problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon, and then select Device Manager.
<br />Expand Display adapters, right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab
<br />Select Uninstall Device.
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.
<br />The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen Device Manager.
<br />Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />Recheck the driver version.   If this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here.  If a different driver version is installed, follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.  
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<h2>            After installing Convenience Rollup ROBOCOPY.EXE is copying files with the creation date more recent.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>After installing the convenience rollup KB3125574, robocopy is copying files considering also the creation date of the file. So, when the file exists in the source and in the destination, it will be copied when the creation date is more recent, even if they
 have the same size and modified date. In windows 7 without KB3125574 and in Windows 10 only the last modified date is considered.</p>
<p>Is there a hotfix for this bug?</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<p>then make a new folder:</p>
<p>md d:\test2</p>
<p>
</p><p>now run:</p>

<p>robocopy d:\test d:\test2 /e</p>

<p>Robocopy performs pretty much as documented. Here are the switches used to deal with different date stamps. You did not seem to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /XN :: eXclude Newer files.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /XO :: eXclude Older files.<br />
</p>
<p>The /IT switch is not useless. You appear to think that it should&nbsp;<strong>exclude</strong> tweaked files. The documentation says that it will
<strong>include</strong> them. They are excluded by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /IT :: Include Tweaked files.</p>

<p>So, if the tweaked files are excluded by default, why they are included on my tests by default like I say on my last paragraph? That's why I say the /IT is useless.</p>
<p>Did you perform any test to reproduce what I'm saying with the SP1 version of robocopy and the Convenience Rollup version of robocopy?</p>
<p>I am not asking how to use robocopy, I know how to use it, and what the switches do.</p>
<p>I'm asking about why is not working like it used to work and it is documented to work,
<strong>after installing the convenience rollup on Windows 7.</strong></p>

<p>I have a&nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; same issue with timestamp ---&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp; I can run&nbsp; robocopy with the /copy:t&nbsp; switch to syn the timestamps, but&nbsp; then I run it again with the fulll copy&nbsp; (data too)&nbsp; it still copies files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the point about the access time&nbsp; being for comparison does make some sense for what&nbsp; I am seeing&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; robocopy log&nbsp; &nbsp;does annotate each file copies with the tag "new file", "newer" "older", etc&nbsp; -- but in this case the tag e blank, so I don't know&nbsp; &nbsp;why robocopy is copying that file&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello DedeHeniff, <br />
<br />
If you still have the 1033.mst file and you have verified it is malware or virus, it may be part of an windows installer file. MST files are used in conjunction with Microsoft Windows installer packages (<a href="http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.MSI</a>
 files).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I suggest you go into Safe Mode and see if you can delete the file from there.<br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if you were able to delete the file.. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>The problems are related; i can't log in because i can't get online. When i try running the troubleshooter, it requires an admin password, but it says my password that I've been using forever is the wrong one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried almost everything posted on here. I will try the only thing that i haven't: getting to the admin account via the CMD prompt.</p>

<p>3 separate places:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- the main Windows logging screen. It says 'your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- on secondary, standard account, when troubleshooting network adapter 'try these repairs as an administrator' - says wrong password.</p>

            That is a very weird issue. First of all, change the MS account password from <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>
<br />Then do a Clean Install or a Reset as per Andre's instructions.

    <title>I keep getting calls from this number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tammynonemaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            I keep getting calls from this number</h2>
                    From&nbsp;800-642-7676. This is the actual number that shows in caller ID. They left a message once, saying to call them back at some other number about fraud or something. It was hard to understand the message. It was pre-recorded, and sounded like a voicemail
 message that was garbled. My husband keeps falling for these stupid phone calls and ends up paying them money to "Fix" his laptop. How can we get this money back, or is that impossible?

Its a total scam. Uninstall their software and then run a System Restore back<br />
to before you installed it. Change all your sensitive passwords on all sites - <br />
email, bank, credit cards and others. (Do not do this on the compromised <br />
computer and it would be best to do on the phone or in-person.)<br />
<br />
You may even want to revert your system back to factory fresh to be sure <br />
their software is&nbsp;not breaching your security. (Means to re-install Windows <br />
Clean - removing everything on&nbsp;the drive so backup any data before hand.)<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any <br />
errors existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your <br />
money or worse to steal your identity.</p>

<p><strong>Do these thoroughly :<br />
</strong></p>
<p><br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will <br />
allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load <br />
of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the <br />
malware and maybe harder to detect as the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added <br />
that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to <br />
detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to <br />
pay the high price later. Check with these to an&nbsp;extreme overkill point and <br />
then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however <br />
you should also run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on <br />
it - RUN AS ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if <br />
it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether<br />
it finds anything or not does not mean you should not check with the other <br />
methods below.<br />

<div>I have&nbsp;win 7&nbsp;64 bit and a&nbsp;Sony DCR-TRV130E&nbsp;camcorder. I have no cd with the camera and cannot ever recall having any.&nbsp; A DV cable connects the camera to the PC.&nbsp; But the computer will not recognize the camcorder. The sony site statesthat the camcorder
 is compatible with the system and: "The drivers needed to connect your Sony camcorder to a computer and transfer files are already included in the operating system."&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am getting nothing whatsoever when connecting the camera and I have also tried 2 cables.</p>
<p>Regarding your suggested fix - the camera does not connect to a USB port.</p>
<p>The DV connection is firewire as, in Windows 7, USBfunctionality is for transferring content from a Memory Stick only. In order to transfer video content from a MiniDV cassette tape an i.LINK (IEEE-1394) connection is required (DV to USB is not supported).</p>
<p>So I installed a IEEE 1394 Firewire PCI card to the PC.&nbsp; This seems to be recognised and is using an MS driver dated 21.06.06:&nbsp; VIA 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller&nbsp; v.6.1.7600.16385&nbsp;(driver has been checked).</p>
<p>Connecting the camera results in absolutely nothing happening.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Hi john,</p>
<p><em>"the camera does not connect to a USB port."</em></p>
<p><em>"USBfunctionality is for transferring content from a Memory Stick only."</em></p>
<p>Are you able to connect the camera to the computers USB port to transfer (not stream) files to the computer from the memory stick?</p>
<p>You can disable your anti-virus temporarily to see if it is causing a conflict:</p>

<p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>I connected the camera to a USB port as suggested, but again it is not recognised.</p>
<p>I disabled the anti virus and firewall but this made no difference either.&nbsp; Connecting using the i.LINK - the camera was still not recognised.</p>

            In my case, with Win-7 64 bit the PC recognizes the Sony camcorder but it recognizes only the inbuilt memory and not the Memory stick added to the Camcorder. I can copy photos/video only from the camcorder's internal inbuilt memory and nothing from the
 16GB Memory Stick expansion slot.

<h2>            Unable to uninstall an app using &#34;Apps and features&#34; in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This question has been asked already, but the thread is locked, and the reply voted "answer" by everyone is no longer applicable under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.&nbsp; In Windows 10 I deleted a folder containing an app I no longer needed.&nbsp; However, it still appears in the "Apps and features" list.&nbsp; When I try to uninstall using Apps &amp; features, it reports an error 2147467259 "Failed to find driver packages to process"
 (it was an old HP printer driver).&nbsp; Once this has happened the uninstall rolls back and the program still appears in "Apps and features".&nbsp; I know I shouldn't have deleted the folder, but the deed is done now, and I'm stuck with this dead program in my "Apps
 and features" list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can remove it, please?</p>

<h2>            Windows Lockscreen &#40;Spotlight, Picture, Slideshow&#41;  is not functioning.</h2>
                    On the lock screen, not a single photo will appear, whether my setting are set to either Spotlight, Picture, or Slideshow. and It won't allow me to set any selected photo as a lock screen as well, keeps showing me an error saying " Cannot set this photo

            Hi Faoud.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br /> What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hi again Fouad -
<br />
<br />These problems indicate possibly deep corruption in the install, typical of the Upgrade or Factory installs.  This is the reason most enthusiasts won't even run one of those inferior installs but prefer to do the Clean install.  This is a great learning experience which will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and apply it with your own hands.  And it's a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So look over the steps here to see if you want to do this now:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then I'd  go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

    <title>Size of desktop items, internet pages, etc. randomly changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sengelbrecht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Size of desktop items, internet pages, etc. randomly changes</h2>
                    When I log on, the size of items on my desktop changes from time to time without me doing anything in control panel-display to make this happen. The setting in control panel has been 100% (default) since I got the computer a couple months ago. Yet sometimes
 when I log in, the screen appearances look normal, and sometimes when I log in, they are larger. There is no rhyme or reason to this change that I can detect.&nbsp; It affects icons on the screen, pages in the internet - everything.

            Hi sengelbrecht,<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Did you make any changes to your computer<br />
<br />
b) Are you running any third-party programs that customize the interface?<br />
<br />
c) Are you running dual monitors or just a single monitor?<br />
<br />
d) Are your display adapters upto date? Make sure you have updated your display adapters.<br />
<br />
<strong>In the meantime, I have few methods for you :</strong> <br />
<br />
The first method I would like you to do is place your machine in a “clean boot” state. “Clean boot” will temporarily disable third party programs and services from loading. This way we can determine if a program and or service is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Start button on your Desktop<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
Once the computer has rebooted, check to see if the Desktop icons keep the size that you have selected. If the icons appear to be the correct size, reboot the computer a couple more times to make sure.<br />
<br />
If this does resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>How to set your computer to boot normal:</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Click the Start button on your Desktop<br />
2.&nbsp; In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3. Click the General tab.<br />
4. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
<span><span>This could also happen if the user account you are using is corrupted. You may try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>To create a user account</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. To open User Accounts, click the Start button, click Control Panel, click User Accounts and Family Safety, and then click User Accounts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Manage another account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Create a new account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.<br />
<br />
For more details follow the link.<br />

</span></span><br />
<br />
If the issue is resolved after creating a new user account, you may want to fix the
<strong>corrupted user account.</strong> <br />
<br />

<p>The issue first began on Friday, November 24th around 11:00.&nbsp; That was the first time I was on the computer for a few weeks.&nbsp; I saw that there was an update, so I restored my computer prior to November 15th, the previous most recent update, and everything
 was fine and my desktop used both monitors independently.&nbsp; As in they stretched from left to right.&nbsp; Then about an hour or so later, the same thing happened.&nbsp; It no longer identified two monitors and the second was identical to the first.&nbsp; Therefore I restored
 it again, and fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to restoring I attempted to&nbsp; fix it through the control panel, where it attempts to identify another monitor.&nbsp; It did not identify one.&nbsp; I then changed the resolution of the monitors, that did not change.&nbsp; I rebooted, nothing&nbsp; I downloaded new drivers,
 nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried a few other things that I had read about.&nbsp; That is when I decided to do the restore as of the 15th, which fixed it every time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the update is making my computer, a Dell Optiplex, unable to identify two monitors.

            <p><span>Hi Ahmad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you get any error message when you are accessing the app?</span></li><li><span>Have you set any proxy to connect to Internet?</span></li><li><span>Is the issue occurring only when you are accessing a particular app?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might be facing this issue due to a corrupt app or software conflicts. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You need at least 1024 X 768 screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen
 resolution of at least 1366 x 768.&nbsp; Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “Screen Resolution” from the menu.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, make sure the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer. To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys on the keyboard, type “Account Control” in the search bar and press “Enter”.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “User Account Control Settings” window, move the slider to the default settings and click “OK”.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s first run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the
 Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a><br />
<br />
For more information, you may also refer the article: “What to do if you have problems with an app” from this link:<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to run the SFC scan and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. When the scan is complete, the System File Checker tool
 indicates whether integrity violations were found. If integrity violations are found, the System File Checker tool lets you fix the integrity violations<br />
<br />
a. Type Command Prompt on the Start Screen.<br />
b. Right click on Command Prompt to select "Run as Administrator".<br />
c. Type: sfc&lt;space&gt;/scannow.<br />
<br />
Note: SFC scan may take a while to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Please post back if the issue persists and we will be glad to assist you further.</span></p>

<h2>            Battlefield Play Style</h2>
                    
<p>Hello friends! &nbsp;I'm a battlefield man through and through and I'm curious of what playstyles people have when playing Bad Company 2 (or any battlefield game for that matter)!</p>
<p>I preferably am a team player, I don't lone wolf often and use medic/**** a lot for heals and ammo. &nbsp;What about you all?</p>

<p>Hi Akuzimo, it's very nice to meet you. When I play I usually go lone wolf when i'm killing my teammates for maximum enjoyment. Normally, I do not require a medic except in special circumstances when I have a secret alliance.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I've always enjoyed being a "Team Player" in BF Games. More accurately, I play for both my Squad (first and foremost) and the entire Team (the blue smurfs) second. I will always support what my Squad needs first. If they need
 an Engineer, I'll come in as an Engineer. If they need an Assault so be it I play as an Assault. And so forth depending on what Class is needed for that time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">With this being said, I'll also play as (and even more importantly) what that particular area of the Map requires. If there is no Equipment, there is no need for an Engineer. I think way too many Players get stuck in a rut when
 it comes to what Class or even Weapon they should play in BF Games. It's pretty easy when it boils down to this;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">In the end though, if a Team doesn't want to play to win and all of them want to become useless (whatever Class) I am more than happy to give them ammo as they camp in their favorite wookie hiding spot while I put a Tracer Dart
 on the back of their head, even Team kill them the next time around. If the Team is still to stupid (or they simply don't care) even after all of this, I'll either leave that Match or join the opposing Team. I have a saying that for that, "I'm not meat fodder
 to pad some other guys K/D".<br />

                    I tried using skype for a camera call and it said no camera was attached. I have a build in camera in my alienware laptop so I tried going to the camera app and it said "We Cannot Find Your Camera: Error Code 0xA00f4244". So I then tried going to my device
 manager to see if I could fix the integrated camera there. But my integrated camera does not show up in my device manager at all. I dont know what else to do and I'd like to fix this issue

            I should also mention, that I am aware my computer is out of warranty. In addition, I have also updated this Alienware M15x laptop to have windows 10 installed. However that was 5 years about. My webcam was working fine last week and now today I do not
 see my integrated webcam in my Device Manager anymore. C:\Users\Eric\OneDrive\WebCamDiagnotics

            There are two other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

            I don't know what else to do. I even tried resetting my computer hoping that would fix my integrated camera issue and still nothing. It did not fix it. I tried going to&nbsp;https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/alienware-m15x/drivers
 to find my integrated camera but it does not support anything past windows 7. Again I had this computer updated with windows 10. Is there anything that you can suggest to help me get my camera back?

            Your dxdiag report shows no video device. Can you try to install your video driver in compatibility mode?
<br />Right click on the setup file &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility tab &gt; Check the box - Run this program in compatibility mode say Windows 7 &gt; Select the right operating system &gt; OK and install
