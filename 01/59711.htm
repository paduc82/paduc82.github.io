<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t make USB flash drive bootable</h2>
                    I am trying to create a windows 10 install USB bootable flash drive.&nbsp; I'm using the Windows 10 ISO and bootsect.exe command.&nbsp; The command says that the drive is locked and won't create a boot sector.&nbsp; I've tried wiping the drive.&nbsp; When I try to create
 a partition on it, it won't allow me to.&nbsp; It will only allow me to format it.&nbsp; When I format it, it won't allow me to set the partition as "Active". I am really frustrated.&nbsp; I wanted to make a Windows 10 install with a partition containing my computer's drivers
 and another partition with a backup of its completed install (after all the updates).&nbsp; It is a Kingston data traveler 32GB flash drive.&nbsp; It worked when I experimented using an old HDD (but the drive failed because of bad sectors).&nbsp; So two issues... it won't
 allow me to make the flash drive bootable, and it won't allow me to partition it.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>What error message do you receive when you try to try to create an Active Partition and when you try to create a partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you try creating a bootable media by following the steps&nbsp;provided below and check if you can successfully create it.</p>
<p>1. Go to this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and download the official Windows 10 media creation tool. Make sure you download the correct one tailored for your desktop operating system which you’re currently running – 32-bit or 64-bit.</p>
<p>2. Plug in a USB drive to your Windows PC.</p>
<p>3. Launch the media creation tool you just downloaded.</p>
<p>4. Select ‘Create installation media for another PC’ option. Click on ‘Next’ in the bottom right corner</p>
<p>5. On the next screen, you’ll be presented with a bunch of options. Select your language, the edition of Windows 10 you wish to download, and&nbsp; the architecture. Click on ‘Next’ once your choices have been made.</p>
<p><span>6. </span>Select the ‘USB flash drive’ option, which should be highlighted by default. Click on ‘Next.<span><br />
</span><span>7. </span>The tool will now prompt you to select the USB drive you’ve plugged into your PC. Click on ‘Next’ once you’ve made your choice.<span><br />
</span><span>8. </span>Windows 10 will now begin downloading and once the process is complete, you will have successfully create a bootable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having stated the above, I would like to inform that you cannot create or store other information in the same flash drive where your Windows 10 bootable Media is created. Doing so will cause you to be unable to install the OS when you are in&nbsp;a no boot situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I've gone over my download usage this month because of upgrading several computers to Windows 10 from 7.&nbsp; I tried reducing my download usage by downloading the ISO image which helped speed up some of the process, but since the tool downloads
 for each computer, it just isn't practical to use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I solved the bootable USB issue, but haven't attempted multiple partitions.&nbsp; I couldn't set the options for the drive from within the Windows 10 disk management, so I had to resort to the command prompt in admin mode...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to have worked for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a Bootable USB Windows Installation Disk from the ISO image...<br />
<br />
Type "cmd" in the search bar and right click on "Command Prompt".<br />
Click "Run as Administrator"<br />
<br />
Make sure you are in the c:\windows\system32 folder.<br />
If not, type "CD c:\windows\system32" and press enter.<br />
<br />
Type "DISKPART" and press enter.<br />
Type "LIST DISK" and press enter.<br />
<br />
Observe which number represents the USB drive.<br />
<br />
Type "SELECT DISK [drive #]" (no brackets) and press enter.<br />
<br />
Type:<br />
CLEAN [enter]<br />
CREATE PRIMARY PARTITION [enter]<br />
SELECT PARTITION 1 [enter]<br />
ACTIVE [enter]<br />
FORMAT FS=NTFS [enter]<br />
<br />
....WAIT FOR COMPLETION...<br />
<br />
ASSIGN [enter]<br />
<br />
EXIT<br />
<br />
leave command window open...<br />
<br />
Go to the Windows 10 ISO Image with the file explorer, right click on it and mount it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the Command Window and change to the mounted drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Drive letter]: [ENTER]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change to the boot folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD boot [enter]</p>
<p>
</p><p>type the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BOOTSECT.EXE /NT60 [drive letter]: [enter]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the file explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure "Show Hiden" is checked<br />
Select all the files and copy.<br />
<br />
Now paste to the USB drive.<br />
<br />
...Wait for Completion...<br />
<br />
Close all windows.<br />
<br />
Now the drive should be a bootable Windows 10 install.<br />

            Also, with the method that worked, If I store the drivers in a folder on that drive, will the install still work?&nbsp; A couple drivers for my laptop were not available for the install and I had to download them from the manufacturer.&nbsp; Just thought it would
 be easier to have them available this way if something should happen.<br />

            I'm seeing in the forums that USB drives can not be partitioned or have their partitions recognized without the use of specialized drivers that need to be loaded first.&nbsp; Guess that rules out a bootable USB with readable partitions. :-(&nbsp; Waist of drive
 space :-(&nbsp; 32GB drive.&nbsp; I'll have to find a cheap 4GB somewhere.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting&nbsp;your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the your query, I&nbsp;would like to inform that you generally can create partition&nbsp;in your USB drive. But if you wish to create a partition in the drive along with a bootable media for in the same drive, you will not be able to boot from the device as
 the&nbsp;criterion of a bootable media needs only the ISO file on the USB to proceed successfully&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm not sure I'm understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was successfully able to make a single bootable primary partition on the USB thumb drive through using the DISKPART command and BOOTSECT command from the command prompt in administrator mode.&nbsp; Windows "Disk Management" would not allow me to make the primary
 partion active or make multiple partitions on the USB thumb drive. (to set it active it had to be done from the prompt)&nbsp; It greys out all the options in "Disk Management".&nbsp; What I originally wanted to do was make two 4GB partitions and one 24GB partition.&nbsp;
 The first (4GB) would be the bootable Windows 10 install, the second (4GB) partition would be my laptop drivers, the third (24GB) partition would be for the System backup (I need aprox 21GB for the backup) after everything is setup and updated (The backup
 command will not allow a backup to the bootable partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you wrote, it appears that you are saying that it should be possible to make the three partitions, but the thumb drive just wouldn't be bootable? Is that correct?&nbsp; And that if the ISO file is on the primary partition it should boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I used from the command prompt does make the device bootable (it worked for me) and the Windows 10 install starts.&nbsp; I just can't make the other partitions.&nbsp; I just wanted to keep all the data on one thumb drive so I could store it away instead
 of having multiple devices getting scattered and lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to see if I could shrink the partition to make the other two partitions, but "Disk Management" won't allow (option is greyed out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to do what I wanted with a USB connected HDD but unfortunately the drive was on its last legs, and was suffering from chronic bad sector disease (probably secondary head failure).&nbsp; That is why I decided to try the USB thumb drive.</p>

<h2>            Backup to Livedrive</h2>
                    I have used Livedrive for a decade or more and love it. It has its own backup system but having had too many interesting experiences with digital storage over the years, I'd like to set up a W10-64 backup and/or disk image to Livedrive (which could be
 any other similar service). Can't figure out how to do this in the W10 / Office 365 environment. Has anybody had any success trying to do this?

<h2>            SD Card reader causes Explorer to hang until the card is removed</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I'm running a Fujitsu laptop with an integrated SD card reader. &nbsp;The machine is about 3 years old. &nbsp;The SD Card was used infrequently, but worked great. &nbsp;Recently tried putting in an SD card (not a new card), and the system hung for a few seconds before
 I got a "Explorer is not responding" message. &nbsp;Trying to "safely remove the hardware" doesn't do anything. &nbsp;If I physically eject the card from the reader, the system goes back to normal operation, and I get a message that "Windows can't stop your 'Generic
 volume' device because it is in use."</p>
<p>I've tried using the card in the reader of another Fujitsu laptop (same model as mine), and the card reads fine with no issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Rutinni,</p>
<p>Since we cannot exactly predict which program is making use of the Card, I would suggest you to close all the applications and shutdown the computer. Once you shutdown the computer, remove your card manually and switch on the computer. Login to windows and
 then plug the card to see if windows explorer works normally or it stops responding.<br />
If the explorer works fine, try using the Safety removal options to unplug the card to see if you can do so.</p>
<p>If the above step did not work, then try disabling your security software and check if that is what causing the problem.</p>
<p>If both the steps fail to resolve the issue, then try the steps below.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Click on Start; In the Start search, type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on ‘+’ to expand Disk Drives <br />
c.&nbsp;Double click on your drive and then on the Policies Tab, select Optimize for Quick Removal.</p>
<p>Now try plugging the drive in and check if everything works normally.</p>
<p>You can also check this issue with Fujitsu if they have any suggestion on this.</p>
<p>Let me know if I’ve answered your query and for further assistance on this issue post us back.</p>

<h2>            How Can I get My Account Back</h2>
                    before 2 years ago, I lived in Australia for a while, and when I got back to my country I tried to sign in
<div>but I got a message saying that I have signed in from an unusual region and they stopped my account!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>when I tried to verify my self, I found out that the verification email is lost too!!</div>
<div>and I tried to fill the verification form hundred times, but couldn't get the info right!!</div>
<div>what do you suggest for me :(</div>
<div>I really need my old email, it means a lot to me&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is one thing that giving me hope is by sending the verification email to my secondary alternate email not the primary one. because when I choose reset my account, it gives me a drop list with two resetting emails, I tried with the secondary but I
 haven't receive any thing&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            BSODs with System Service Exceptions related to ddkmd.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting lots of BSODs recently, 3-4 per day, relating to ddkmd.sys and always with a System Service Exception.</p>
<p>Here is the most recent minidump, as a zipped file in onedrive (as per the recommendations of a user in a thread answering a similar question. I can post it in a different format if necessary)</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgiEUffxg9iAvCDhthq9tMCEYn-c<br />
I would really appreciate someone taking a look and trying to work out what is wrong. I ran a diagnostic but nothing came up wrong.</p>
<p>I think it may be related to video - it seems to crash most when I am trying to view video footage, but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and I can provide any information necessary.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi aliflo
<br />
<br />The minidump file confirms that ddkmd.sys is causing your system crashes
<br />
<br />That is related to some display device, but little is reported on that driver file. Do you have a Fresco Logic USB Display Device?

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have verified the clone is running well you can reformat the partition on the HDD</p>
<p>and expand that space into another partition or just create a new partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will only have to buy a new Win10 if you get a new motherboard, and even then you can generally</p>

<h2>            Skype Preview &#47;&#47; Global hotkeys are now available in Skype for Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Available for the store app in the Microsoft Store</p>
<p>Version: 14.42.54.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our continued effort to match features our users loved in pervious versions of Skype, we're happy to share that in the latest Skype Insider update, we have global hotkeys available for the store app in the Microsoft store!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You no longer need to bring Skype to the foreground to reject calls, or toggle between muting yourself and unmuting. To reject incoming calls when other applications are in focus, simply use the
<strong>Ctrl+E</strong> shortcut. While in a call, you can use <strong>Ctrl+M</strong> to toggle between mute and unmute, and use
<strong>Ctrl+E</strong> to end your call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These hotkeys will be automatically enable in your updated Insiders build, to disable, you can always turn it off under Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soon we'll have a shortcut for answering a call, stay tuned!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try out these shortcuts and leave us your feedback on your experience.&nbsp;</p>

            Great! I was just about to create&nbsp; a new reporting post against this hotkey problem with skype8, and eventually read this article. Happy to see it in windows10 version, and waiting for same for skype for desktop. Also, do add the global shortcut to answer
 the call without focussing the skype window, in both desktop and windows 10 versions.

<p>Already did, but I keep testing, hoping that they will actually fix the new version. Right now, Version 8 and 10, is about 15% of what it should be and I'm concerned that they are going to completely block Classic from connecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At their current development rate, the new version is likely about 5 or 6 years away. They seem more concerned with adding fluff than adding anything that gets the product anywhere close to being usable again.</p>

            Hello A! You actually do not need a Sysadmin product key, you only need to rightclick the program you want to run and select "run as an administrator". I hope that helps!

            What's this key needed for?  Activation?  There is no System Admin Product Key.
<br />
<br />A Windows Product Key is either retail purchased in a box in store or online, preinstalled if it comes on a PC from the factory, or a keyless Digital License for the free Upgrade which will reactivate after you install - just skip the key.
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This is from the friend code page: <em>
If you pre-ordered Anthem digitally from the Xbox or PS4 stores, your Friend Passes will be available on this page&nbsp;<strong>after you’ve started playing the VIP Demo</strong>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the VIP demo is now over so you wouldn't get a code at this point.</p>

<p>thas true, but the open beta(demo) starts soon and all the pre orders can test all the javelins. so if ea says i didnt pre order i cant use this feature as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i pre order and Goodies are promoted(digital or physical) i want to have it cause thats the reason i pre order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in fact i want be able to Play Anthem earlier when ea says i didnt preorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the only Thing i want , is to talk with the xbox suport and i dont know how to reach them</p>

            This has been an EA issue, even if they won't tell you that, for last weekend they just ended up opening the Demo up to everyone and giving some rewards (vinyls) to the "VIPs."&nbsp; Just have your friends download the demo this weekend coming up and playing
 it, it will be an open BETA for everyone and they should get in.

<p>The error code you're receiving is an internet error code. We have a support article that can help with the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/xbox-live/error-code-8007-2751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">8007-2751 error</a>. Give the steps a shot there to see if they help out.</p>
<p>There are two other articles that can also help you out. The first one is the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Connection Error Solution</a> page. This should help you if you go through each step (if you haven't already) to get a full connection. The second one is the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/random-disconnect-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Random Disconnection Solution</a> page. The 8007-2751 error generally appears when the connection isn't good enough with your ISP, and some bits of information are being dropped while it's transferring. I also see that you are wireless (based on the information you've provided me). I highly suggested connecting to your Nighthawk with a wired connection for the best experience on your Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Give all this a shot and let me know how it goes. :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, I am the owner of an Asus X555LB which was originally windows 8.1 but now runs Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had recently installed the Java Development kit for my Object oriented programming class. I put my computer to sleep and take it to college everyday, so when I opened my laptop today.. It was shutdown, I tried booting it up but it failed and took me to
 bios apparently (Bad_system_config). After that I pressed F8 and was able to access repair options and safe mode. I got it to boot back up normally but when I put it to sleep, the system crashes. When I try resetting to a restore point, I get the error(0x800070017)
 to before the java installation or any other point. I tried repair but got some srt.txt error. I have not been able to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now the computer is able to boot properly but is unable to go into sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any possible help that I can get</p>

    <title>How can I manually set Windows to reset a device each time the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drnickb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I manually set Windows to reset a device each time the computer wakes from sleep&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Logitech g510 keyboard that likes to malfunction after the computer wakes from a prolonged period of sleep. Unplugging and then re-plugging the keyboard back into the computer seems to fix this problem each time, but is impractical.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run the device troubleshooter, the issue is not recognized. However, I have noticed that Windows has the capability to "reset" a device each time the computer wakes from sleep, but this solution only appears to be available as an automatic function
 of the troubleshooter.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is: How can I <u>manually</u>&nbsp;set Windows to reset my keyboard each time my computer wakes from sleep?</div>

            I know the option you're referring to, and I also find it strange that it's missing. That would have been my first line of action, but the option to change that setting simply isn't there.
<div><br />
<div>I did however, while poking around, find a button that allows certain devices such as USB root hubs to be "reset". Pressing it seems to have a similar effect to unplugging everything from the constituent ports and then reinserting and detecting each device.
 This seems to reboot the keyboard (as the keyboard had its own firmware) and then everything works fine. Is there a way to automate this process each time the computer wakes from sleep, or am I doomed to press this button, disable and re-enable the root hub,
 or unplug the keyboard each and every time I wake the computer?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I don't know if this helps, but I'm starting to believe that the problem stems from multiple types of hardware present in the keyboard and their tendency to be detected individually by the OS (I.e. the physical keyboard, audio ports, LCD screen,
 and internal memory) it seems that the internal memory which controls the LCD screen and macro keys just doesn't want to be automatically detected and populated after sleeping.&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>have tried software like devcon with "restart" switch and that returns "Restart Failed" for each device. Using devcon with removing the hub and rescan seemingly does nothing.</p>

<h2>            Whea_Uncontrollable_Error</h2>
                    I just experienced an Whea_Uncontrollable_Error on my PC when i was watching a Youtube video and ever since my computer has been freezing every few minutes for a few seconds and the sound cuts out randomly. Got the computer almost a year ago. Is there
 a way to fix this problem.

<h2>            Windows update error 0x8024402</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows Update troubleshooter which fixed a number of problems except 0x8024402.&nbsp; I used the troubleshooter because (1) I kept getting the message that "Windows update can not currently check for updates because you must first restart the computer
 so that a previous installation can be completed."&nbsp; (2) I have been unable to delete the Windows 10 reminder and unable to find the KB3035583 update which apparently governs the reminder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

    <title>Windows 10,Bluetooth and a Nokia 113 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardt09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10,Bluetooth and a Nokia 113</h2>
                    <p>My Acer Aspire E17 with Windows 10 and my old Nokia 113 are shown on both as paired for Bluetooth and yet I've failed to send photo's from the phone to my laptop despite trying a number of times in the last two days. Having looked at a number of on line
 possibilities including tutorials I seem to be up to&nbsp; date with everything but still failing to send the photo's across. The Bluetooth tie up between the phone and laptop has worked on many occasions previously, certainly with Windows 7.The Windows 10 upgrade
 dates from January this year and I can't remember whether the Bluetooth photo link has been used between the Nokia and Windows 10 in the past six months. Can anybody help please as the photo's were taken by my wife and are required urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I recommend you first try unpairing the phone, restart your computer, then pair it again.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Add Bluetooth wizard in Control Panel
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add device then add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />Have you checked for updated chipset drivers for your make and model?
<br />Also, some manufacturers will provide separate Bluetooth drivers.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth Support Service
<br />Right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab
<br />Click in the Startup type: listbox
<br />Choose Automatic
<br />Click Start
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try include the Bluetooth troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth
<br />Click Bluetooth then click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Bluetooth
<br />Right click each entry then click Properties
<br />Select the driver tab, click Rollback if its not grayed out.
<br />
<br />If it is grayed out, right click Bluetooth driver then click uninstall
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />If not, remove any other Bluetooth devices since they might be causing interference .
<br />
<br />You can also try pairing through Devices and Printers. Learn more:

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst researching for answers to your queries and checks I came across the answer to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the right hand side of the Bluetooth and Devices page there is a link---Send or receive files on Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had to use this link when sending Nokia photos to my laptop before but it really works even if I'm now having to use&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive to view and store the photos.</p>

<h2>            Skype messages not appearing</h2>
                    How do I get Skype for Windows 10 to send and receive? I can see that I've got a new message on my phone but it isn't showing on my computer. To get it up I have to send a reply message and then it appears. I can't see a way to update otherwise (like send/receive
 button in outlook or similar).

<p>I have this same issue, was waiting all night to talk to my partner overseas and saw they had been on 1 hour ago but weren't now.</p>
<p>sent a message and all of a sudden 3 missed calls appear and 2 messages appear, my phone doens't even have a record of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice my status keeps going away despite the chat window being open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>previously my phone was getting calls and messages before my desktop despite being on the same connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what is the point of having a desktop app if it wont' stay connected or notify me of calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>dumpmsg says i'm connected, I've tried the /MSNP24 command but it doens't seem to have triggered anything (my partner might ask me what's with the weird messages as well), I've logged out and back in for now and see if things improve but missing calls and
 messages has been an ongoing thing since I've moved to the new windows 10 app.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft crashes Windows 10 edition</h2>
                    The last coupe of days I have been trying to work my way through an underwater temple. Of course the elder guardians gave me mining fatigue repeatedly. While trying to break sponges to dry them and replace to remove water I experienced numerous game crashes.
 Some times the game would let me break 2 or 3 sponges other times as soon as I tried to break the first sponge it would crash. Only happened when the mining fatigue affect was active. If I drank some milk and got rid of the mining fatigue affect I had no problems.
 Numerous crashes -hundreds of crash not just 2 or 3 over a few hours game play over 2 or 3 days.<br />
<br />
Also the game crashes when mining under water within the affected radius of a conduit. Have experience about 10 crashes last night and today.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
These are not related 2 separate instances, as conduit is no where near the under water temple. 1 whole game days walk/run away from each other.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Home Version 1803 Build 17134.407<br />
<br />
Java version 8 update 191 (build 1.8.0_191-b12)

<p>Hi Lone Wolf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, has this been happening with any worlds in the game? Or just this one world? Sometimes save games in Minecraft can be corrupted causing crashes, the best way to resolve that would be to attempt to play an older version of the save to
 prevent the bug from occurring again. Also try reinstalling Minecraft on Windows 10, here's an article on how to do so:

            This is the only world I have experienced this on. World was created after last update was installed. No update to the game since I created it. so don't see how it could have gotten corrupted. Don't want to uninstall and reinstall as this is the only problem
 I am having and don't believe it is a corruption problem actually believe it to be bugs in the game as I said the only time I have an issue is when the mining fatigue affect and the conduit affect are active. No problems any other time. Game runs fine. No
 crashes...

<p>Where do I find the save files in Windows 10 version? I found a folder named saves and it has 2 worlds in it but both are from Minecraft for pc version not windows 10 version... Yes I have both on my pc... Also, if I uninstall the Windows 10 version can
 I download it again? I got the windows 10 version for free when I bought Minecraft for pc. The mojang website next to Windows 10 version says redeemed... How would I go about redownloading when it was a free download to begin with?</p>

<p>ok found the world save files copied them. Uninstalled and re-installed Minecraft for windows 10. After installing and updating created a new world, after 10 minutes of playing the game crashed while digging dirt. So this is the 3rd instance of the game
 crashing while mining/digging... I would say in total in the last 3 days my game has crashed probably close to 300 times.</p>

<p>Hi there Lone Wolf kk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with Minecraft crashing. I recommend reaching out to the developer for more assistance. It seems that the recent update may be affecting the game and will need a patch to fix the error.

            The crashing is happening to me too. Sometimes before crashing does your game freeze? Sometimes mine will just crash and close out and just be gone and other times it will freeze, mostly when im breaking a block but it also has when im just running, and
 it will freeze. I wont be able to move. After 5-7 seconds of freeze, then it crashes. Its irritating. I also noticed after uninstalling the game, upon reinstallation, it had remembered certain setting or something, cant remember exactly, but it let me know
 that some data was left stored on my computer. Maybe in registry or something i dont know. Im no expert but i would think the reason for reinstalling the game would be to get a fresh start. But that doesnt seem to be happening. I need to know where to go to
 delete all data. Like to get into the registry, program files, absolutely everywhere w
