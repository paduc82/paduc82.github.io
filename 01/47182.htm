                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue where my PC freezes about 30 minutes into playing games. Please see my system specs below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10</p>
<p>Intel i7 4770k (NO OC)</p>
<p>MSI Z87-G45 Gaming motherboard</p>
<p>Powercolor R9 290x (NO OC)</p>
<p>16GB RAM (4 sticks X 4 GB)</p>
<p>600W PSU (Corsair)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shutdown did NOT create a minidump or full dump. I have Kernal Dumps enabled. The temperature of the CPU at shutdown was ~ 55C and the GPU was at a sustained 80C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have a suggestion to solve this issue. I don't know where to go from here if my PC does not generate minidumps/memory dumps.</p>

<p>Grab the MSI Afterburner and use that to watch your video card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could be one of a few things I have seen with the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now restart the game periodically until AMD gets their drivers better tuned for the R9 cards</p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice. I already use MSI Afterburner - it is how I monitored the temperatures. It gives me no additional information; no temp spikes, load spikes, etc...</p>

</p><p>It happens unexpectedly so restarting the game periodically doesn't help either.<br />

            <p>hey man I have an r9 290 tri-x and not having any issues though I only jumped in it real quick to test my card out and only had about 5 mins in it, my trouble shooting ideas are as fallows : download the newest catalyst control center which is 5.8 I think,
 turn off all over clocked settings especially overdrive &lt; over drive if not set right can kill your card, set the settings a bit at a time in the gaming part and see when it starts messing up make sure you have your resolution and all that set to how you want
 it before messing with 3d applications, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>in game and this is very very important with a ati card TURN OF NVIDIA HAIR, it will also kill your card,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>on mine I had everything except hair physics turned all the way up to max and my card was begging me for more, was at the max fps that game will allow which lets say is 60fps (which I think it is but anyways just fallow along with me) so lets say the max
 fps IS theoretically 60, the lowest my card would drop was to 58fps, but as I said I wasn't in it long enough to actually notice any major impacts ie fight scenes particle effects and so on, if you have the game on steam add -high to the launch options, it
 also wouldn't hurt to download NVidia phisics for ati or amd, also make sure your gpu is getting enough power when I first plugging my card in and booted up my new system I kept getting black screens as if my card was starving for power so I had to open my
 case and turn on the afc (automatic fan control) which is the lil black switch in the back of the card (which I had no idea was there until looking at an image of my exact card) I also turned on its eufo eufi ugh the bios you can use a mouse in on the card
 (though I still have yet to figure out how to access it), anyways hope this helps you email me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and let me know</p>

            <p>I agree hence is why I suggested to turn it off lol, there is a work around for ati cards if you wanted a similar effect, its not nvidias hair phisics but more of a configuration of sorts through catalyst control to which it gives you the desired effect
 or emulates it to the best it can wiht out killing your card</p>

    <title>Windows 10 settings for custom features of keyboards &#47; mice, mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgm12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 settings for custom features of keyboards &#47; mice, mouse and keyboard center is not availabe</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 set (WiFi mouse &amp; keyboard) installed on my new Surface Book (Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst these are both Microsoft parts and driver details are correctly found by Windows (both appear correctly in
<em>Devices &amp; Printers</em>), none of the "custom" features of either device are available for customisation / setting in the Windows 10 settings or under the Control Panel settings.&nbsp; For example any of the soft keys of the keyboard or Rear / Front Thumb buttons
 of the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way that I've been able to restore these features is to re-install the Windows 8 (64 bit)
<em>Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center</em>, for which I can't seem to see any Windows 10 downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both devices work fine with this Desktop App installed, but I'm wondering if I've missed something and there is in fact a way to setup these features without the clunky additional software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>BGM12</p>

<h2>            Photos won&#39;t export video - stops at 7&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a video project. It's multiple videos and adds up to 48min. When I try to export it stops at 7% with the wheel of doom. When I cancel I get error which may not be related 0x8013153B, and related to the cancellation.</p>
<p>I can create small videos at a couple of minutes. I can't find any reference to limits of files, size or length.</p>
<p>This is Windows 10 Microsoft Photos 2018.18091.17210.0</p>

            Hi Random, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />You might be able to fix the freezing problem by repairing or resetting the Photos app. I've found that this usually fixes issues like this.
<br />
<br />Here's instructions on how to repair or reset the app:
<br />- Click Start and type "apps &amp; features".
<br />- Select Apps &amp; Features.
<br />- Find the app in the list and select it.
<br />- Click Advanced Options
<br />- Click Reset, or if that doesn't fix the problem, try repair.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support after trying these steps! Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>Don't bother with MS support answers. They give false advises. Some time ago I've found a thread about this issue where MS support replied and advised to rest the app. Someone asked explicitly if this won't delete the movie creations. They repliey it won't.
 They were wrong!! I followed this advice and lost hours of work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now regarding you issue. I've observed what happens when Photos are exporting a movie. I noticed there's a high GPU load for this task. So I thought - why not not to try to disable my GPU in Device Manager and see what happens. And it turned out it fixed
 the problem for me!!! Instead of GPU rendering - the CPU takes over the whole thing. It's significantly slower, but it always works! Before I was not able to export my movie. It stopped once at 51%, sometimes at 18, 35 - totally random. But with CPU rendering
 it always works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found another thread with a similar advice - this time from MS support. The solution is easier - disable hardware acceleration for movie encoding:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-photo-app-exportshare-function-problem/21e3977b-d119-4435-85d0-9b615c2075be</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS does crappy apps as always. Nothing changed since Windows 95. They have issues. The Photos app gives good and basic capabilities, but is slow as hell. My Sony Xperia 5 years old tablet running on 2 old ARM 1.4 GHz cores offers a similar app and believe
 me - it is a lot faster than MS Photos running on 4x3.8 GHz Intel CPU and AMD GPU. MS have a lot to do with this app to make it faster and first of all - MORE RELIABLE!. Once I lost my movie creation as some error started to show up and nothing was able to
 fix it. Unfortunately nothing but app reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - I hope this advice helps you.&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
<span><strong>Which files will be affected?</strong></span>
<div><br />
When you reset your PC, the drive will be completely reset, and all your apps and files will be removed from it. Windows 8 will be reinstalled, and you'll need to change any settings and reinstall any apps that you want to get back after resetting. If you know
 if any files that you don't want to lose, then you should back those files up before starting the reset.</div>
<br />
<span><strong>What if I have multiple drives?</strong></span>
<div>
<p>You can choose whether to reset all hard drives or just the one with Windows 8 installed on it. Any drive that Windows 8 doesn't recognize, such as those with non-Windows operating systems, will not be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            It was included as part of what I paid for the computer (so I paid for it somewhere along the line), and I have bought multiple versions over the years. It definitely wasn't&nbsp;trial version. A company like Microsoft must have my details and activation code
 on their systems so I will call them. Otherwise yes, I will use open office or get it the way most people who don't pay for things online do. But thankyou for the links and for trying to help :)

 my details and activation code on their systems so I will call them. Otherwise yes, I will use open office or get it the way most people who don't pay for things online do. But thankyou for the links and for trying to help :)

<p>Office has never come for free with a Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>You either have to pay extra for Office when you purchase your Laptop or Computer, or it is a Trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if the operating system came preinstalled it is nothing to do with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The thing that stands out about this is that you do not have the Office Activation Product key.</p>
<p>If you paid for it, you should have the Product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck..</p>

    <title>Laptop crashes after restarting to install update and fails to install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop crashes after restarting to install update and fails to install update</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I'm having a problem with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows hasn't been automatically updating, or at least some of the updates don't seem to automatically download and install.
</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of how I started the process of trying to initiate an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6c84796-f493-438b-986f-337c1bea7bcf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6c84796-f493-438b-986f-337c1bea7bcf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit the "Check for updates" button and it downloads and then installs an update, which leads to the next screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07eabeb2-da22-424c-ab88-576d3ba3aef7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07eabeb2-da22-424c-ab88-576d3ba3aef7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I hit the "Restart now" button and my laptop begins to restart. But someway through the restart process, my laptop crashes and I get the below error message.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/700c48de-2a4c-4396-af99-abf8bae0acbe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/700c48de-2a4c-4396-af99-abf8bae0acbe?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then my laptop restarts again and it says "Preparing to configure Windows" but soon after that I get the below screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9808585f-5236-4081-bb46-8294ed349d80?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9808585f-5236-4081-bb46-8294ed349d80?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this point, it boots up and I can sign in again, but I get a little message in the bottom right corner of my desktop telling me that Window's couldn't install the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could I have some assistance in attempting to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manveer</p>

            First of all, sorry for the troubles the updates are causing you.
<br />This is an ongoing issue with many Windows customers.
<br />That being I would advise that you wait till the Spring update comes out.
<br />So basically hold tight for about a month.
<br />
<br />If you do not want to do that then please let me know what is the make and model of your PC?
<br />Also what is the current version of Windows you are running?
<br />Go to search and type winver for this information.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your patience.

<p>I tried the manual install, but the problem seems to be when I restart my laptop after the update. The same thing happened with my laptop crashing, and then undoing the changes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 2012 Server &#40;not R2&#41; resolution problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having a problem with the resolution on my computer while using Windows 2012 server.&nbsp; I had an older computer that broke down one day after a power failure, forcing me to go out and buy another one.&nbsp; I only run Windows 2012 server on it, so after
 I got the new computer all set up and the old hard drive plugged back in (I say "old" as in about 4 months), it worked great, until one day I rebooted it after making a system change, and now the resolution is shot.&nbsp; I was displaying it in 1280x1024, but now
 I can't get anything higher than 800x600, and this is causing me a real headache.&nbsp; I've installed all the system drivers off the DVD that came with it, including the resolution drivers, and updated all the drivers and software from MS, but still I can't get
 it to increase the resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a custom built PC with an MSI motherboard, Intel Core i5-7500, 3.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who can help!</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 detects WPA-PSK network as WEP&#59; can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 detects WPA-PSK network as WEP&#59; can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t enter WPA key</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox 360 Kinect (a Christmas present) wrongly detects my wireless network as WEP rather than WPA-PSK. &nbsp;It only gives me the option to enter a WEP password; the available length of the password field isn't long enough to accommodate my WPA key. &nbsp;I also
 seem to have no option to access the network configuration to tell the Xbox that it's actually a WPA-PSK network. &nbsp;Until this is resolved I can't use Xbox Live because I don't have a wired connection in the room where the Xbox resides. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to
 resolve this dilemma would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm using a ZoneAlarm Z100G router which is supporting a mix of Windows 7 and Apple computers, an iPad, and an iPod Touch with no problem. &nbsp;Is there a way to transfer the network settings from my Windows 7 computer to the Xbox?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ensure your Zonealarm firmware is up to date , check their website to see if there is a later version to try out.</p>

<p>Everything is fully up to date and works with every other system I have. &nbsp;Why can't the Xbox recognize this as a WPA network (everything else does) and let me configure it accordingly?</p>

<p>Have you tried the advanced settings and specifying an unlisted network? </p>
<p>The xbox might be having a minor glitch - if you temporarily tried a wired connection just long enough to get into configure network, advanced settings and then restore to factory defaults. That will erase all the saved network information, which might let
 it change to WPA. Odd issue, so I'm not sure what else to suggest.</p>

<p>Actually, I spoke too soon. &nbsp;After connecting via wired network, the Xbox downloaded an update from Xbox Live. &nbsp;After the update completed, I tried again with the same results. &nbsp;Then I shut the Xbox down, brought it back up, and tried again -- this time
 it let me put my wireless network in as an unspecified network. &nbsp;That worked, and connected to the internet but not XBL. &nbsp;Tried again, and it connected to XBL on the second try.</p>

            Gmail is a webmail service, there is no option to set itas a direct default unless you setup your Gmail account in the Windows 10 Mail app.

    <title>Unable to remove user account or enable hidden administrator. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyhler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to remove user account or enable hidden administrator.</h2>
                    My sister thought she'd be sneaky, and decided to add another account to my computer with no password and admin access. Only, this downgraded my account (the main user) to a standard account. Okay, simple fix: I logged in as the new admin, set my main
 account as the administrator, and set the new account as standard. Then I logged back into my account to delete the new one; only it won't let me. I don't have permission to delete the account, even though I'm clearly the only admin account on the computer.
 Frustrated, I try another route: I'll enable the hidden administrator account and delete the new account that way. Again, I don't have permission to do that, either. How do I get rid of the new account and restore my main account to it's full-access admin
 rights?

            <p>Thank you for replying, however I was able to fix the problem. It appears that the system just didn't recognize my account being changed back to the administrator, but restarting my computer made it realize, and I was able to delete the extra account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the matter of promoting/demoting accounts. I wasn't implying that when the extra account was upgraded to admin that my other account was automagically downgraded, I was simply stating that my sister had downgraded it, and after I had tried to set it back
 to admin, it wouldn't recognize the change. Simple mis-understanding, and I appreciate you attempting to fix the problem.</p>

<h2>            NFL Madden 13 Freezing for Xbox360</h2>
                    
<p>when i try to play Madden NFL 13 on my xbox 360 arcade it freezes, apparently alot of people are experiencing this problem, if it is on the Xbox 360 Arcade that you are having this problem as well, then try deleting the update from your system, and dont
 let it download when you go back into the game. iv had problems with it freezing through alost every game i play, but without the update i havent had it happen yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>

<p>EA's online servers are bad too. got NCAA 13 and played it in august and the online play would continually freeze during the action. madden seems to be picking up in it's footsteps. players seem sluggish and game freezes momentarily. kicking a FG with that
 touchy meter not knowing when it's going to go off ? forget it. the onlin play is a major letdown.</p>

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue!
<br />
<br />I'm arabic and I can ready the website page. But, Before downloading the files needed, and as I've had the same issue, it will prompt a message that another DLL is missing. This happen often with Adove softwares.
<br />To be honest, I've reinstalled a fresh copy and it resolved the issue.

            Hi, I’m Virginia an independent advisor.
<br />Please do not download any automatic ‘fit it’ tools as these can install malware or make the problem worse.
<br />Visit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/297700...</a> &amp; download the latest Visual C++ 
<br />If this doesn’t work then run sfc:
<br />Open cmd prompt/powershell with admin &amp; type: SFC /SCANNOW &amp; press enter.
<br />If these don’t work please post back as we can move on to other suggestions.

            Hi zakariyaguenda,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />MSVCR120.DLL is part of VC++ 2013 Redistributables. Install it from below link - x64 means 64 bit and x86 means 32 bit of Windows. Choose as per your bit of Windows which most likely should be 64 bit.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3179560/update-for-visual-c-2013-and-visual-c-redistributable-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/317956...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Windows 10 DHCP decline Loop</h2>
                    <p>My new Windows install in a VM has started refusing to connect to the Internet. I am using "Bridged Mode" for the network connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Wireshark running on the VM Host.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 issues a DHCP request, It is granted one by the router</p>
<p>The DHCP is acknowledged</p>
<p>A number of packet exchanges take place using the IP address</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1<br />
Host: 239.255.255.250:1900<br />
ST: uuid:98ebada5-b544-5d4f-8e69-3dcb2c014014<br />
Man: "ssdp:discover"<br />
MX: 3</p>
<p>None of these are responded to</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 issues a DCHP decline and reverts to a 168.254 address&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole Cycle repeats forever getting a different IP address each time from my router</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switch the VM to NAT mode then it connects correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening after I connected my host laptop to a different network which changed the DHCP address range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If relevant I am using Avast AV on my W10 guest but it makes no difference if I disable it.</p>

                    22 november the Xbox ONE will be launched in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand. And not in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland.
 Microsoft will make less profit than expected because of the late delivery in the countries where the Xbox are launching in 2014. What is your opinion? Please comment

<p>I think they are not releasing the Xbox one in tier 2 country's because they are wanting to flood the tier 1 ones, it's good business sense.</p>
<p>I do not think they will lose any money at all because the same amount of consoles will be made and sold weather they are sold in all country's or not, they are still making the same amount of consoles but they are only going to the 13 country's and they
 will all be sold out release day.</p>

<p>I live in Norway so obviously I'm disappointed with the delay, but the 360 still has some life in it. It'll hold me over just fine, but I will get the X1 as soon as it launches where I live.</p>

<p>I live in the Netherlands. I'm certainly not happy with the delay. I hope Microsoft will have a release date for us soon. Got the Xbox One pre-ordered already.</p>

<p>It's the fault of those countries for not speaking English (US or GB dialects) as a primary language. The delay is due to voice localization work that isn't complete yet.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>And neither will Microsoft. That leaves the door wide open for Nintendo and their Wii U!!! Oh... hang on... never mind. Simply put Japan isn't the battle ground for either Microsoft or Sony, and because of this it's there turn to get shafted. I would feel
 sorry for them, but given I live n the EU and since I was a kid I've been forced to wait far longer than seemed reasonable for Japanese based consoles... part of me is smiling. I believe the Germans refer to it as schadenfreude.</p>
