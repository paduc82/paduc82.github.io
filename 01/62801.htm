<h2>            SOLUTION&#58;  HP Officejet v40 &#38; Windows 7 Printing Problems</h2>
                    <u><b>WORK-AROUND</b></u><br />
I recently received a computer running Windows 7 and like many of you, have had issues with my HP Officejet v40 printing properly.&nbsp; I've tired many different options offered by people on this site and search the internet also for answers as to why this happens
 and what to do about it.&nbsp; I haven't figured out WHY this occurs (especially since Microsoft and HP insist the drivers are built into Windows 7) but I think I've figured out a way for everyone to get the printer to work.<br />
<br />
If your document is one page only, then you probably will not have a problem at all printing.&nbsp; However, I have found that multiple page documents is where things get weird - printer only prints part of a page and errors out.&nbsp; My work around is:&nbsp; only print
 one page at a time - i.e., either go to a page and select PRINT CURRENT PAGE or select to print only Page 3 for example.&nbsp; When I do this, no print problems.&nbsp; Fortunately, the docs that I HAVE to print out haven't been more than a few pages.&nbsp; If you have a
 really big doc, well . . . at least you won't have to buy a new printer!&nbsp; Hope this works for everyone else.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

    <title>Thumbnails in File Explorer are tiny &#40;even when selecting extra - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenniferdow1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thumbnails in File Explorer are tiny &#40;even when selecting extra large icons in View menu&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a few hours of research on a problem I have with my new Microsoft Surface Pro.&nbsp; Turns out my husband's Surface Pro from 2 years ago does the exact same thing.&nbsp; Problem is when trying to view photo icons/thumbnails.&nbsp; When I change the view to
 Extra Large or even Large, they are the same size and barely larger than the medium size icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading multiple forums and fixes (yes, I tried most of them)… I can't seem to find a solution... if there even is one.&nbsp; What seems the most logical is an issue with screen resolution and display settings.&nbsp; (Mine is set to 250% because everything was
 too tiny when at 100%)</p>
<p>Could someone from Microsoft please explain if it intends to be fixed.&nbsp; I couldn't find answers on forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are certain limitations with displaying photos in Extra large icons view. If the image itself doesn't have high resolution, it would still look small even on the largest icons view. That being said, can you tell me the dimensions of your images? Simply
 right-click the image, select <strong>Properties</strong>, go to the <strong>Details
</strong>tab, and then scroll down to <strong>Dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the images do have high resolution, I advise rebuilding your system's icon cache using an elevated
<strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong>. This procedure will stop the Windows Explorer (explorer.exe). Thus, your desktop items and the taskbar will disappear for a short while.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all of your programs.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button and type <strong>Command</strong> <strong>
Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong> and then choose <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>If prompted, select <strong>Yes</strong> or enter the administrator password.</li><li>Copy and paste the command below one at a time into the <strong>Command</strong>
<strong>Prompt</strong> window and then hit <strong>Enter</strong> after each command.
<ul>
<li><strong>ie4uinit.exe -show</strong></li><li><strong>taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F</strong></li><li><strong>DEL /A /Q "%localappdata%\IconCache.db"</strong></li><li><strong>DEL /A /F /Q "%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache*"</strong></li><li><strong>explorer.exe</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>

<p>Thank you so much for the reply,</p>
<p>To answer your first question:&nbsp; All icon thumbnails of varying resolutions and dimensions and file types are affected (even the program icons on documents like WORD, EXCEL, and PDFs).&nbsp; There is a difference in size from medium to Large... but very subtle...
 and no difference in size from Large to Extra Large (However the spacing between icons does increase).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your steps precisely for the icon cache purge and unfortunately, no change was made.&nbsp; I have tried something similar before with purging the thumbnail cache... as well as using the easy method of the mouse scroll wheel while holding CTRL.&nbsp; As
 I mentioned before I browsed all the forums of people with the same problem and it seems everyone of them have not found a solution and tried everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I mentioned before... my husbands computer (also a Microsoft Surface Pro) does the exact same thing.&nbsp; It doesn't bother him though.&nbsp; I am pretty thorough about organizing my files and it gets frustrating to not be able to see the image in order
 to file them in specific folders. I have to open each image, look at it, remember the file number, close it out, then drag and drop. As you can imagine it's very tedious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you foresee Microsoft addressing this differently?&nbsp; Or am I out of options and need to adjust?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time and thought on this.</p>

<p>Hello again,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per your request here are 3 screenshots with the varying view settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for furthering your investigation into this. As you can tell.&nbsp; The medium is so tiny as to not make out any detail, Large is not that much larger and is still difficult to see detail, and Extra Large is the same size with bigger spacing
 between icons. The file sizes are of all varying resolutions so you can see the image properties don't affect the change in setting.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes&#63;  when I try to log on.</h2>
                    Well, the title explains it really, &nbsp;my pc is not the greatest, &nbsp;had previous issues with it, &nbsp;and once again I have run into some trouble. &nbsp;I turn on my pc fine, &nbsp;but before the problem occurring, &nbsp;it took a long while to load up to the sign in screen,
 &nbsp;but this morning when I opened it up it said, &nbsp;not sure if this is exact, &nbsp;but "fixing disk something or other, &nbsp;this may take over an hour". &nbsp;I left it for about 6 hours and it had done this, &nbsp;but because of my pc being idle, &nbsp;it was off. &nbsp;I turned it back
 on and to what I thought had solved the problem, &nbsp;as it had loaded much faster, &nbsp;this error message had made it so when I try to log in, &nbsp;I can't use my mouse which has new batteries, &nbsp;tested that it works, &nbsp;and I can't log in, It freezes on the welcome screen.
 &nbsp;I would be thankful if someone could help, &nbsp;Cheers.&nbsp;

<h2>            Creating a &#39;Now Playing&#39; playlist in Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    I'm pretty sure this was a function in earlier versions or maybe this was in this edition but I lost it...<br />
<br />
There used to be a 'Now Playing' playlist option in the left pane, but now it's been taken away and moved to the right pane entirely. The right pane, by design, no longer has all the information about artist, album, file size etc., that you would be able to
 get if you were looking at that song track in the main (center pane) like a normal playlist.<br />
<br />
How do I get the right pane, the 'unsaved list' moved to the center main screen so I can see all the track information, edit star rating etc?<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I looked through the videos and they didn't provide the option that I wanted. On the plus side, now I know the left pane is the 'navigation pane', center pane is the 'details pane' and the right pane is the 'list pane'. Also, I realised that it is possible
 to edit star rating in the list pane. But what I really want to see are the bit rates, file sizes, album, artist, genre and all the information that the details pane can give me that the list pane does not for the tracks that are currently playing.<br />
<br />
So is there a way to create a constantly updating&nbsp; 'Now Playing' playlist? Auto Playlist seemed to be on the right track but did not have the needed criteria.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Mac no longer working-- Microsoft are you listening at all&#63; We&#39;re not all on PCs</h2>
                    I've been using Skype for 20 years now....but for the past few days, the software just doesn't work anymore.&nbsp; I got a new iMac in September this year and Skype software worked okay then.&nbsp; Lately, the software will not connect to any contacts.&nbsp; (The chat
 still connects, though).&nbsp; If&nbsp; I call Skype test call, it just hangs up before connecting.&nbsp; Yet, if I sign into Skype on web browser version, everything works fine!&nbsp; The android version on my tablet works; the iphone version works.&nbsp; The only thing that doesn't
 is the Mac version of the software.&nbsp; My contacts who use Mac software are having the same problem.&nbsp; Microsoft you need to address this issue!

<p>Your "solution" had no effect whatsoever!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MacOS Sierra 10.12.6/Skype 7.59.37 dmg&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I've checked this community.&nbsp; There are thousands of us for whom Skype no longer works despite having the latest software versions of either Skype or Mac Sierra.&nbsp; I presume when High Sierra is finally fully promulgated that will be even more disgruntled
 Skype users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft you took a fine product, Skype, and "fixed" it into oblivion -- at least for Mac users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't mess with the web browser version....it's the only one that I can use at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm angry.&nbsp; Before you offer a "new and Improved" version, shouldn't you test it?</p>

<p>Solved.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>By accident I discovered that Skype would work again when I used a VPN, which set me on a path:&nbsp; it had to be about the connection.&nbsp; I checked my router, port forward, firewall, etc.&nbsp; Everything was as it should be, but as soon as the VPN was turned off,
 Skype wouldn't connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, frustration really,&nbsp; I opened Skype preferences/advanced to see if there was something I was missing.&nbsp; The only thing I hadn't checked was "proxy."&nbsp; I don't deal with proxies.&nbsp; Pressing the proxy button in Skype brought me to Mac's Ethernet
 Network proxy page.&nbsp; Lo and behold I noticed that on the very bottom of the page, "passive ftp" was checked.&nbsp; I unchecked it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now Skype is working.</p>

<p>voce precisa alterar seus permisos, se voce tem uma conta de menor, tem que adicionar alguma conta de adulto. os permisos podem ser alterados entrando em xbox.com click em seu gamertag, click en configuracioes do xbox, cick em seguridade e privacidade online,
 eu acho que account.microsoft.com/family 'e para que voce faz uma conta de adulto, entao adiciona sua conta de menor nesse site, em caso esse seja seu problema, que sua conta de menor nao tenha conta de adulto para alterar os permisos</p>

<p>Cara, eu tenho Just Dance 4, acontecia o mesmo.</p>
<p>Pude perceber que nos jogos com Kinect sempre pedia para entrar com um perfil, algumas vezes conclui metas de 5 estrelas, porém quando entrava no outro dia não tinha as estrelas.</p>
<p>Isso pode ser provocado por dois motivos:</p>
<p>1- Eu não prestava atenção e entrava como convidado, ao invés de logar com meu perfil.</p>
<p>2- Hd lotado, sem espaço pra nada.</p>
<p>Não sei se há outros motivos, mas no meu caso eram esses...</p>

<p>Digo isso por que estive pesquisando melhor, olha só o relato desse cara:</p>

<p>Marcos dijo faz 6 dias</p>
<p>Meu Xbox é original, e tive a inocência de usar "mod" no forza horizon, e ainda joguei online com os carros do tráfego, kkkk enfim, voltei com meu save original mas algumas funções do jogo foram bloqueadas, por exemplo colocar adesivos, e quando eu jogo
 no modo carreira e mesmo no online, os pontos e níveis ñ são computados no game, ou seja, eu ganho dinheiro e nível, mas depois perco tudo! Moral da história, ñ seja menino mal como eu fui, ñ usem "mod's", apesar de serem fantásticos e ainda dar muito mais
 prazer em jogar, sejam certinhos ok?</p>

    <title>Port Forwarding Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xx rozilla xx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Port Forwarding Question</h2>
                    
<p>On my Router (ASUS RT-N 56u) I can do Port Forward.</p>

<p>So I have konfigured my Ports.</p>
<p>Service Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local IP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local Port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protokoll</p>
<p>xbox live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my local IP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both</p>

<p>Someone told me, that i don´t need the local Port? It would be better for p2p connections without local Port? Is this right?</p>

<p>Whats the difference between the 3 options</p>
<p>1. like i showed</p>
<p>2. Port Range empty but local Port 3074</p>
<p>3. Port Range 3074 and local Port empty</p>

<p>What is the right Configuration?</p>

<p>Is someone able to explain this?</p>

<p>Having a local port there is fine. All it is saying is that when something comes to your network into "mail slot 3074", automatically put it in your xbox's "mail slot 3074" which it should be expecting because that's where it is suppose to go. Instead of
 trying to decide on the fly. That's probably the best analogy I can give you.</p>

<p>Xbox LIVE requires the following ports to be open:</p>
<p>•Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>•Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>•Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>•Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>Also, if you have a UPnP option, you might not to port forward anything.</p>
<p>Try connecteting with just the UPnP option.</p>

<p>Sorry. I guess I should have explained your options.</p>
<p>1. See Above.</p>
<p>2. Don't do that. It means you throw everything into that port on your xbox. I don't think it should let you do that anyway.</p>
<p>3. Decides on the fly where it should go, which is probably 3074.</p>
<p>Some people also just do a DMZ and point everything at their local IP on the xbox with the assumption that everything can go there and then figure out if it shouldn't go there. I think there are a few additional ports that the xbox 360 uses, so you may want
 to add those too. This goes under the assumption that there is no network exploit to hack an xbox. Putting a local PC on DMZ however is different, and should be avoided unless you always secure it with patches and have a local firewall and have a reason why
 you want to access your PC from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Xbox LIVE requires the following ports to be open: (you can forward them if you want, Port 80 is standard web surfing, so you probably don't need to point that one if you don't want to, just make sure you can use it)</p>
<ul>
<li>Port 88 (UDP)&nbsp; </li><li>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)&nbsp; </li><li>Port 53 (UDP and TCP)&nbsp; </li><li>Port 80 (TCP)&nbsp; </li></ul>

<p>The proper way to forward ports on an ASUS RT-N56U is through Virtual Server.<br /><br />Have you tried using only UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router?&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
<div>There are numerous entries for Vista Windows 7 and Windows 8 to fix the Event with 10016.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like:http://blog.ronnypot.nl/?p=843</div>

<div>I'm just wondering is this something an end-user needs to solve by him/her-self or is Microsoft aware of this and will fix it in a SP or hotfix or something?</div>

Source: DCOM<br />
Version: 5.2<br />
Symbolic Name: EVENT_COM_ACCESS_DENIED_IN_SERVER_ACTIVATION_OR_LAUNCH_PERMISSION<br />
*Message: <br />
The %1 permission settings do not grant %2 %3 permission for the COM Server application with CLSID %4 to the user %5\%6 SID (%7). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;MESSAGE KEYS: %1 = machine-default, application-specific; %2 = local, remote; %3 = launch, activation; %4 = ; %5 = /; %6 = .<br />

Explanation: <br />
A program, the CL-SID {00020820-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} displayed in the message, tried to start the DCOM server by using the DCOM infrastructure. Based on the security ID (SID), this user does not have the necessary permissions to start the DCOM server.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
User Action: <br />
&nbsp; Verify that the user has the appropriate permissions to start the DCOM server. </p>
<p>To assign permissions go thru the following steps:<br />
1.Using Regedit, navigate to the following registry value HKCR\Clsid\*clsid value\localserver32<br />
&nbsp; (*The clsid value is the information displayed in the message.) <br />
2.In the right pane, double-click Default. The Edit String dialog box is displayed. Leave this dialog box open.
<br />
3.Click Start, and then click Control Panel. <br />
4.Double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Component Services. <br />
5.In the Component Services snap-in, expand Computers, expand My Computer, and double-click DCOM Config.
<br />
6.In the right pane, locate the program by using its friendly name. <br />
7.Right-click the program name, and then select Properties. <br />
8.On the Security tab, in the Launch and Activation Permissions group box, select Customize, and then click Edit.
<br />
9.Add the user to the permissions list, and *give the user the appropriate permissions.
<br />
10. Apply and close windows in reverse order</p>

</p><p>I stumbled upon this same issue on a Windows Server 2012 box and wanted to share my fix, just in case it helps anyone else. &nbsp;You'll need to grant Administrator access to edit these, but to do so you'll need to change the ownership of the registry entry first:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;IMPORTANT: Run Regedit as 'Administrator' and find your class id in question.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now open the components services and find your entry and you should now have the options available. &nbsp;If you have component services already open be sure to refresh the folder first.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#38; 8 not compatible with DIsplayPort 1.2&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have two Dell u3014 monitors connected via a daisy chain to my two ASUS GTX 780 in SLI on a ASUS Rampage 3 Extreme motherboard running Windows 7 pro 64-bit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With the monitor set to DisplayPort 1.2, Windows refuses to boot up after Post. However, when changing the monitor settings to DisplayPort 1.1, Windows starts as usual. Once Windows is loaded I can then switch back to 1.2 and I'll get my dual (extended)
 screen setup working just fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Obviously I want to be able to boot my computer without having to change the settings on my monitor every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried with one and two GPU's, both monitors and also with Windows 7 x86/x64, Windows 8 x64, Windows 8.1 x64 PreRelease but nothing works. Yes, I've also tried with a number of different drivers from both ASUS and Nvidia, and again nothing work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My suspicion falls on Windows not being compatible with DisplayPort 1.2, since the problem occurs before Windows starts to load and therefore no drivers would've had the chance to initiate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I'm open for suggestion. Any idea?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Obviously my frustration is sky high since I'm out a lot of money for something that isn't working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you very much for a quick reply. Appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have been in contact with ASUS (Sweden) and their reply is: "As of today, Nvidia cards require Windows 8 in order to get DP 1.2 to work. Sorry..."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Swedish reply:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I dagsläget så kräver Nvidiakort Windows 8 för att DP 1.2 ska fungera. Tyvärr...</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I am very surprised by the response from ASUS. Not involved at all. A simple setup at their own lab would easily verify/confirm my problem. It's a 5 minute job. But I quess it's like Tom Logan says in his

            Hi again,
<div><br />
<div>finally some new from qualified people:</div>
<div><br />
<div><font color="black"><span>Hello,&nbsp;</span></font><font color="black"><span><br />
This is actually a limitation with the current implementation of dp 1.2, so during bios run, it will not route correctly using daisychain and thus the result you see.</span></font><font color="black"><span><br />
We suggest you use the DP 1.1 port for daisy chain setup.</span></font><font color="black"><span><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - bringing active windows to the top</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 7, I had 'activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse' (under "Ease of Access") turned on, because I want to hover the mouse over a window, and have that window be active and pop up to the front.</p>
<p>I don't see this setting at all in Windows 10. I see that the Window becomes Active, but does not pop to the front, which is the worst solution of all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get the mouse to make a window active, and change focus to that window, and get it to come to the front?</p>

            <p>Hi - this is the exact setting I turn on, in Windows 7 (inserted below, with red arrow) :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This allows me to move the cursor onto a window - that window then becomes active, and is raised to the front.<br />
This certainly does 'make it easier to manage windows'. Where is this setting found on Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok lest me explain it in a better way, I installed my copy of rare replay a few months back, because of the lack of space i need it to uninstall 2 or 4 games i was nto playing atm for some others &nbsp;that i was going to play whit my friend's. SO now i want
 them back since i finish the games and unlock the achievements so i want them back but somehow i cant seem to install them again &nbsp;i have the core rare replay game installed and i am missing the viva piñata games and the Perfect dark games. &nbsp;i put the game
 disck but is not installing the missing games, and i try launching the game rare replay and see if i press play the games it trigger the installation but it dint, so i dont want to delete all the collection just to install some games, is there a way to make
 it install just the game i am missing?.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>All good, they are still there :) What you need to do, is go to your dashboard, then go down to the bottom of the screen and go into your "My Games and Apps". Then, in the Games area, scroll all the way over to the right, and you should get to the "ready
 to install" section, where you'll find them :) Then just click on them, and hit 'install' and they'll be added to your games list :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>i just solve it &nbsp;DENAz666 instead of going to the "My Games and Apps" just place the game disc, and on the dashboard where you can launch the game disc &nbsp;in use, press the start bottom and select "Manage Collection" and there it will show all the game on
 the game disc and install them from there.</p>

<h2>            Fable 2 crashing on xbox 360 and Xbox One&#33;&#33;&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I played Fable 2 for awhile on my xbox one and then decided to just play it on my xbox 360.&nbsp; I got to a point where I am supposed to go to Brightwood and meet 2 heroes and when I fast traveled it just froze up on me. I even tried doing different things like powering down removing the disc and putting it back in etc.... Even walking there it does the same thing! So I decided to play back on the XBOX one and it does the exact same thing on there as well. Everything else I can do. Just going to brightwood causes this crash. I am really PO'D by this. The game was brand new and it has not scratches on it at all. I am guessing that it could be a corrupted save file on the cloud (not the first time this happened) unfortunately you can only do one save at a time so I can't go back. Then again it can't be a save file because I go back to the last save I had before. I saw that some people have had this issue online. Any ideas?<br /></p>

his</span> and her relationship. Now his girlfriend thinks that he has been telling people that they are doing things they aren't and she has completely blocked communications with everyone and will not answer her phone when he or anyone else calls her. The
 "friend" has also threatened to change his name to something even worse about the two of them. This is against the code of conduct for xbox live and can and should result in a ban on his xbox.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Paying Customer.</p>

<p><strong>Mod Edit: Please do not name and shame on the forums. Thank you.</strong></p>

<p>@Daft Badger He has called the help line and they permitted and instructed him to do this for his help. As for the other post with the same issue, there is nothing wrong with it being posted as the Xbox user is involved in the matter as the problem above
 stated. This issue involves multiple people which is why there is a similar post.</p>
<p>As for me I am apart of this as support as I was in the party as ReclessFlamingo called the support line and attempted to assist him prior to the call.</p>

<p>I live problems like this also.I dont know what to do,it all started with another player i have met several months ago,he introduced trolls in my friendlist over months without me knowing,and now,they are over 200 laughing at my mental condition by calling
 me derpy hooves,oreo,skittles and many others indirects insults so xbox wouldnt notice if i file complain them...They call themselves doctors and try to "cure"my mental condition by insults and shock treatments,the guy who started this,his nickname(and not
 gt)is santa satan,so its pretty current for me to add a new friend and see his/her avatar dressed as a christmas character or to see indirects insults in their bios...i had to remove all friends,and now,im so exhausted of this i have to hide and cant play
 online anymore because they join me with differents gamertags anytimes....</p>

<h2>            Making speakers&#47;headset swappable in Windows 10 &#40;not plugging&#47;unplugging&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same issues for years. I have a nice gaming headset (Steelseries Arctis 3) and some crappy logitech Speakers. I want to be able to swap between the two without plugging in or unplugging them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen in the taskbar that on other computers you can switch the playback device by clicking the sound icon. My issue is that nothing gets recognized. Whatever is being 'heard' at the moment always shows up as "Speakers."</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/nkF2KdB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is a screenshot of what I'm talking about (My taskbar, Playback Devices, and Realtek HD Audio Manager).</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite both speakers and headset being plugged in, I can only have it come out of the headset...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me set it up so I can swap between the two easily? Right now the speakers are plugged in the back, and the headset are plugged in the front port. Swapping areas does not help my headset get recognized.</p>

            Hi copet, 
<br />
<br />You might need to install Steel Series's software to get this working: <a href="https://steelseries.com/engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://steelseries.com/engine</a>
<br />
<br />The software will install the drivers, and allow you to configure the headset settings. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this doesn't resolve your issue. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<p>Hello Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it installed but it still doesn't show up in Playback. It DOES change the device name to "Speakers +SSE3" but they are not separate. I don't see any options that would change this and have tried everything within the Steelseries manager.</p>
