                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Mail issues

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>I did not get one!</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Other</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows Vista N version</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
First of all the question above about which operating system? y tower just says windows vista with nothing after it, so I just clicked on windows vista N version. Don't know if that was right or not.<br />
A while back I changed the color of the letters I type in my emails. I was looking for something else when I found this. So now I want to change it back and can not find where it is! I looked through messenger, essentials and everything else I could find to
 look through and still can't find it. And this was permanent. Has nothing to do with the letter color option on the page where you can temporarily change the color on the email currently being typed. I was in somewhere where you can personalize your email
 settings. Can anyone tell me where it was? Thanks- Gail <br />

            Hi Gail,<br />
<br />
That's okay, since this issue only involves&nbsp;the settings inside your Hotmail Account, the exact specification of your Computer is not really that important, Windows Vista will suffice.<br />
<br />
For you to change the font settings of your emails, please refer to the steps below:<br />
1. On the upper right corner of your Hotmail Page, please click <strong>Options </strong>
and then <strong>More Options.<br />
</strong>2. Under <strong>Writing Email</strong>, click on <strong>Message font and signature</strong>.<br />
3. You should be able to personalize your Message's font type and color from that page<br />
*You can also add an signature to your emails if you want to add one below your message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Do you get any errors related to updates?
<p>1. Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Update.<br />
2. In the left pane, click View update history.<br />
3. Find an update for Windows that has failed to install, and then double-click the update to view more information.<br />
Updates that have failed to install will display Failed under Status, next to the update name.<br />
4. In the Windows Update dialog box, next to Error details, review the error code for the failed update.
<br />
5. Either follow the links in the Windows Update dialog box under More Information or Help and Support to try to fix the problem, and then try installing updates again by using Windows Update in Control Panel or post the error codes so perhaps someone may be
 able to assist further.</p>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<p><strong>How do I reset the Windows Update settings?</strong><br />

            Hi Malkeleah,<br />
<br />
Thank you much for your response actually I got it all fixed sunday night....I knew it was not &nbsp;the mouse... it's just driving me crazy 'coz at the same time I was also fixing other trouble issues not related to this... and I knew it was some kind of a virus
 activity got into my computer system... I just could not figure it out coz my antivirus was on all the time... and then I realized one of my antivirus program softwares was accidentally deactivated by mistake that was probably the time it got into.... Anyway,
 you just gave me the MAGIC WORD ... clean boot the system.... even though I did not do that it gave me an idea what happen before and what to do&nbsp; next ..... I realized the virus maybe&nbsp;was able to changed the settings of my system set up BIOS CMOS configurations....
 so I checked that ....F2 key&nbsp;...and it was some of them were wrong which I expected... since I know the right configurations of my set up coz I keep a record of it so I changed it...saved and exit restart the computer.... and then ... WHALA !!!!! that's when
 the power of magic begins....every single thing is back to normal..... WELL ... so far it's normal until now .... damned I am good !!! I mean you're good.... all you&nbsp;guys are marvelous.... support specialists, network technicians and engineers are all good...
 I learn from you people just by checking and studying your techniques out of this Forum.....
<br />
Have a great day..... qcpjr

    <title>How do I import Microsoft Edge history and bookmarks INTO Google - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinzold  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I import Microsoft Edge history and bookmarks INTO Google Chrome&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is bloody excellent, but Microsoft edge? That browser is still in beta.</p>
<p>It crashes, it hangs, it's slow, no extensions.... I've got a list of stuff they really need to fix.</p>
<p>I've used it for the past several months after importing my history and bookmarks from google chrome into microsoft edge. Now, I wanna do the latter. I want to import my microsoft edge bookmarks BACK into google chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the problem is that google chrome doesn't have an official "import microsoft edge" option. It only has internet explorer or... a bookmarks/history html file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the file of microsoft edge's history located? Thx in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If you're one of those support engineers who are just going to spam me useless Answers and waste my time, don't bother. At least read my post first. I've had history with you guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P. P. S. If you're one of those community moderators who have just seen what I have written above and is censoring it, think of what you're doing. Nothing I said above was wrong. They're useless and they're extremely unhelpful. You're just not letting me
 express my opinion.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Edge does not have Favorite exporting at this time.<br />
<br />
You can export from IE 11 though same as always.<br />
<br />
In Windows 10 you can run Edge or Internet Explorer 11 (Start Button -<br />
All Apps - Windows Accessories - Internet Explorer).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary update takes 24 hours to install, why&#63;</h2>
                    My desktop pc is already working for 24 hours installing this update.&nbsp; This is a fast pc with plenty of disk space and fiber optic connection at 200 MB speed so I don't understand why it&nbsp;is taking so long.&nbsp; The hard drive is totally silent, it is as if
 it is doing nothing.&nbsp; After 24 hours it shows 91% done so it will probably continue for 8 more hours.&nbsp; MS there is something wrong here!!!

<p>The Antivirus was active, I use Avira.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down the pc and restarted and it went to the previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp; I just gave up, every time there is a major update it takes 24 hours or more so this is not practical.</p>

</p><p>This update seems to do some of the install while still on the desktop.&nbsp; Do you know how long that part took?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system spent about 15 minutes on the desktop and then another 30 to complete the update..&nbsp; I do have a semi-fast internet connection but these times were after the download had completed.&nbsp; There was some additional downloading after the install started
 and it may be substantial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are there any external devices hanging on the system?&nbsp; Have you had any problems in the past during installs or updates with any devices on the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the folder <em>$Windows.~WS </em>which may contain some log files you could check.&nbsp; It is a hidden folder and should be in the C partition.</p>

    <title>Safe To Delete&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> van1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safe To Delete&#63;</h2>
                    The root directory of my C drive contains stuff that seems like garbage to me.<br />
<br />
1. $SysReset: Contains an empty Logs folder. Haven't done any kind of reset/refresh--don't even know what that means.<br />
2. Driver_allOS: Contains a folder called <span>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">Audio</span></span>. This contains lots of files and folders that seem like they could be important, but none have been modified in years.<br />
3. inetpub: Apparently this has to do with creating a web site, which I haven't done and won't do.<br />
4. Intel: This contains only a Logs folder with 5 text documents in it, none of which have been touched in years. I do have an Intel motherboard and chip.<br />
5. PerfLogs: Empty.<br />
<br />
Can I safely delete any of these things? Oh, and please don't ask me why I want to delete this stuff; I think my first sentence says it all. If you don't know, just drive on by. And MS Insiders/Moderators/Gurus/Whatever, please don't waste your or my time giving
 me the rote answer that it's a system file and shouldn't be touched.&nbsp; You did that with the 'wiatrace' file, and you were wrong.&nbsp; Deleting that file absolutely is not a problem.&nbsp; What I'm looking for is a practical, real-world answer, not the party line.&nbsp;
 Thanks.

            Hi  joelleayoub.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.

<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that to avoid prosecution for felony theft and piracy they need to make the activation good.
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.
<br />
<br />  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi joelleayoub 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 does not expire . . .
<br />
<br />Most likely your PC is licenced for Windows 10 Home, and you are somehow running the volume licence of Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .       
        </p>

            If it worked before the update, I suggest you download the Xbox Insider Hub app and file a report. This way the development team can investigate. Have you tried a soft factory reset? Go to settings&gt;system&gt;console info and select reset console, select reset
 keeping all games and apps.

<h2>            USB2.0 JPEG WEBCAM INSTALLATION TO WINDOWS 7</h2>
                    
<p>I can't access my USB2.0 JPEG webcam after installing the software.</p>
<p>When I plug in to USB of the Camera, the lights come on, and an automatic update comes saying, "windows is installing new USB device". But at the end a message will come again "windows did not succeed to automatically install your USB device".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried downloading, installing and using Microsoft Fix It, but it tells me "no software for this device"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. what should i do. I've been trying to install this camera for a week now</p>

                    I tried buying Bulletstorm after choosing purchase and backing out using B by accident (after 3 secs of choosing purchase on the loading thing), it took my money and it didn't start downloading. Anyway I can get my money back or get the game without paying
 again?

    <title>na.ads.yahoo.com trying to access my PC Banner July 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            na.ads.yahoo.com trying to access my PC Banner  July 2017</h2>
                    <p>I did updates on my Windows 8.1, IE 11&nbsp;&nbsp;the last 2 weeks and now when I do my password and Yahoo ID on Yahoo log-in page a banner comes up on the bottom of my screen asking me if I want to allow a&nbsp; na.ads.yahoo.com through on my Microsoft Shell UI Helper
 which does not allow or support this site. I only caught this because another banner to the left had the address of the site wanting into my PC. It is very deceptive because it makes you think it is for your Yahoo Homepage and it isn't. I always click on "Don't
 Allow" and my log-in to my Yahoo is fine, but this thing keeps trying to get me to allow it and I don't know HOW TO STOP IT!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial banner stating my Microsoft Shell UI Helper does not allow this site is a large banner at the bottom of my screen and the deception is that one thinks it is for a persons Yahoo account and if you do not catch the actual site wanting access to
 the left the big banner asking you to allow and click on "allow" it is a malware that I read about already. I don't know how to get rid of this coming up. Can someone please tell me how to get rid of this thing?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Defender picks nothing up so I am assuming it has never gotten in to my PC.&nbsp; HOW DO I STOP THIS BANNER?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ISSUE is malware&nbsp; na.ads.yahoo.com trying to access my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My Update:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I just added <a href="https://na.ads.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://na.ads.yahoo.com</a> to my "Restricted Sites" in my Internet Explorer. I restarted my PC and went to my Yahoo log-in Page and the initial banner with me clicking on "allow" came up, but the other banner to the left with the web trying to get in did
 not come up at all.&nbsp; I don't know if putting this <a href="https://na.ads.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://na.ads.yahoo.com</a> on the "Restricted Sites" did the trick or not, but the site banner never came up. The "allow" Don't allow" banner is still coming up.&nbsp; Still could use some input and thanks.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2nd Update:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It has been 8 hours and it seems the solution with mine was putting&nbsp;the address in "Restricted sites" in my IE 11. I have been ok since, BUT the banner from Microsoft Shell UI Helper to "allow", "don't allow" still comes up and I will continue to
 click on "don't allow" even though the other banner has disappeared with the na.ads.yahoo on it. If anyone has any input I still would like to read it here. Thanks</strong></p>

<p>Today is Aug. 2, 2017 and I took another step today and got Malware Bytes. My Defender has never picked up anything, I trusted it would. I actually decided to buy Malware Bytes today. The product picked up 2 issues my Defender never did and that being 2
 Trojan.Agent.RVGen</p>
<p>Both are now in quarantine on Malware Bytes. Guess what&gt;???&nbsp; The Banner's are all gone and while the Microsoft Banner may have protected me from hitting "allow" I wondered how many other's were letting this
<a href="https://na.ads.yahoo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://na.ads.yahoo</a> in thinking it was ok because it was Yahoo. It's not safe, it's malware, a Trojan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, if you are getting a Microsoft Banner from Microsoft and it is from the MICROSOFT SHELL UI HELPER add-on for ieframe.dll (IE 11) and it has an "allow" and "don't allow" to click on you should always click on "don't allow". This malware/Trojan
 is in your PC.&nbsp; If your Defender never picked it up, check your "history" in your Defender, then you should get another option to check your PC for infection issues. My issue was finally resolved today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good Luck.</strong></p>

            Just tried all of this - and computer just stays on! Obviously Microsoft needs to look at this, only since last update.&nbsp; I suspect Cortana may be the culprit - it is the one new process and it seems to be running in the background.&nbsp; The other processes
 are old ones.

            <p>So none of the help from the experts worked. This is a common problem, so I'll post the real fix here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has changed some of the default settings and one of them is ..... the Slide Show setting.&nbsp; For reasons I can not fathom the Slide Show now has a setting that
</p>
<p>So go to Advanced Slide Show Settings and turn OFF the setting that says that the computer never turns off.&nbsp; Now set this lot of settings to turn off after however many minutes you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sneaky one Microsoft, but I got it eventually.</p>

    <title>When will we get inverted vertical taskbars&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phyzisist  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will we get inverted vertical taskbars&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Monitors are wider than they are high. Applications tend to require more vertical space than horizontal space. Nobody has so many taskbar pins that a vertical taskbar is not enough. Hence it just makes so much sense to have a vertical taskbar: less space
 wasted! However, if you do this, you'll find that there is no way to then flip it so that the start button is in the lower left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have been asking for this feature for about a decade now. Is it ever going to be a thing? What puzzles me is that I see no reason why flipping the button order on the taskbar would be hard, I'm sure Microsoft has plenty of talented people who could
 code that in a day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: my start button is in the upper left corner instead of the bottom left corner, and this makes me sad.</p>

            <p>Hello, ronaldtmc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your network administrator is the individual who manages&nbsp;your network. In an office environment, this person would be one of the IT staff. If you manage your own (e.g. home) network, then you are the network administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps,</p>
<p>Michael</p>
