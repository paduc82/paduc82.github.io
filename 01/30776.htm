<h2>            Static &#47; Buzz sound when connected to charger with battery performance set to &#39;high performance&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed a constant low static/buzz sound when I have my surface book 2 plugged into the charger (directly or via laptop dock) AND battery performance mode is set to 'high performance'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Better Performance' - occasional static/buzz is heard but sound is lower in volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't encounter this issue any other time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switched audio to mute/max - does not affect the static/buzz sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That was strange. Can you confirm the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>How are you using your Surface Book 2?</li><li>Have you tried to check for and install the latest update?</li><li>Did you recently make any changes on your device such as installing new software or attaching new hardware?</li></ul>

<p>Erwin Nga, what Hapster365 is facing is called 'coil whine'. Sure you have heard of it as of today.. if not THAT would be strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No - its not normal! But ignored from Microsoft for a while now..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for all of you guys wanting to join a group of frustrated Surface Book 2 owners with coil whine, go to another thread:</p>

            <p>Bill, </p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Windows 8.1 Compatibility site, your <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=HP%20ScanJet%204370%20Photo%20Scanner&amp;vendor=%E6%83%A0%E6%99%AE&amp;Locale=1031%2C1033%2C1036%2C1040%2C1041%2C1042%2C1043%2C1046%2C1049%2C2057%2C3081%2C3082%2C3084%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=L1970A&amp;BreadCrumbPath=HP%204370&amp;LastSearchTerm=HP%2B4370&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP 4370 scanner isn't compatible</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>What might work though is to run the driver installer in Compatibility mode for Windows 7. You can download those drivers from HP's site here:
<a href="http://h20566.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/psi/swdHome/?cc=ca&amp;cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;lang=en&amp;sp4ts.oid=457534&amp;ac.admitted=1398620416074.876444892.199480143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h20566.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/psi/swdHome/?cc=ca&amp;cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;lang=en&amp;sp4ts.oid=457534&amp;ac.admitted=1398620416074.876444892.199480143</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the software in Compatibility mode, right click the setup file, go to "Properties" and then click the "Compatibility" tab. You'll see the option to run the installer in Compatibility mode for Windows 7 in there. Click Apply/OK to exit and then
 run the setup file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Printers usually require that you install the drivers before connecting the device to the computer. I don't know if that will apply to your scanner, but check the installation instructions just in case.

            <p>There appears to be a problem with the download links which keep looping. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you'll have to do here is to contact HP and explain to them that their site isn't working properly and you can't download any drivers.

<p>Bill, </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can try doing is to run the drivers in compatibility mode for Vista. Here's how to go about that.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Vista driver installer and go to Properties.</li><li>Click the Compatibilitty tab and then select Run this program in compatibility mode and choose Windows Vista from the drop down menu.</li><li>Click Apply/OK and then run the installer in the normal way.</li></ol>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the compatibility menu with Windows 7 selected in this particular case. You can change that to Vista via the dropdown menu.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much Xircal for that advice.&nbsp; I too was trying to get my HP Scanjet 4370 to work with a Windows 8.1 computer.&nbsp; From the HP website, I selected 'Microsoft Windows Vista (64 bit)', then under '&nbsp;Driver - Product Installation Software', I selected
 'HP Scanjet Full Feature Software and Driver' and clicked on Download.&nbsp; In the dialogue box that opened, I selected 'Save as'.&nbsp; When the download completed, I took the advice of right click on the file name, then Properties / Compatibility, then selected 'Windows
 Vista' (out of three Windows Vista options presented).&nbsp; I then clicked Apply and OK, and closed the dialogue box.&nbsp; I then double clicked the file and selected Run.&nbsp; During the installation process, I was prompted to power on and connect the scanner, which
 I did.&nbsp; The installation completed, and shortcuts for HP Solution Center and HP Photosmart Essential appeared on the desktop.&nbsp; From the HP website, I also downloaded the update 'Patch To Help Locate the Scanned Image or File for Scanjet Software version 13.0',
 but when I right-clicked on it there was no option for Compatibility.&nbsp; When I ran the update, I got a message saying 'This update does not support any of the HP device drivers that you have on your PC.&nbsp; You do not need this software update.'.&nbsp; I then opened
 the HP Solution Center that had installed.&nbsp; I'm not sure that the screens in HP Solution Center appear exactly as they should, but I was able to complete two test scans on a photo (to jpeg) and a document (to searchable pdf) and both worked properly.&nbsp; So your
 workaround has saved me having to send a good piece of hardware to recycling, and having to buy a new scanner.&nbsp; Thanks a million!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are updating Windows from an older version of Windows, such as XP, you will see many functions that have been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of these changes are the result of making Windows much more secure than previous versions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have an upgraded version of windows. I bought an Acer Aspire S7 with 8.1 already installed. I just can't seem to carry out many tasks that I can on Windows 7 and XP (2 other desktops).</p>
<p>e.g. When I get an attachment with an email, whether it be a document, photo or spreadsheet............I cannot save to where I want to, being advised that I do not have administrator rights ?? do I wish to save it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot understand how with Onedrive (Skydrive); I can save items from Facebook, but not attachments with emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Microsoft have the potential Windows 9 ready to be launched, surely there should be some law that makes them sort out Windows 8.1 first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I further understand that the designers (4 of them ?) have upped and walked out on Microsoft, too many faults</p>

                    I have about had it with the xbox enforcement team. I had just gotten off of being communication banned for 1 week because of a modder for the 2nd time in a month my guess is the person didn't like that i found out he was modding and reported me for who
 knows what and less then a week later i get communication banned for 2 weeks despite me not sending any messages to people nor communicating anything disruptive or inappropriate over voice chat. As soon as i was banned for the 2nd time for the same reason
 i stopped saying anything to any modder or player that upset me greatly i kept everything to myself and i put all this and more in the case review and they replied with nothing that caused the ban and upheld it anyway without a reasonable explanation. And
 since i had literally done nothing to warrant a ban in the first place they should have ended the ban right then and there but no they obviously don't care about the innocent customers/players not to mention i have reported hundreds of

u r incorrect since no code of conduct rules were broken and i say this to u as well if u had read the post u would know that i already filed for the case review and got no reply that gave any mention to wat caused this random unjust ban and as i also stated
 in the post i havent said anything in text or in-game voice to any modder of unsavory players to warrant a ban either so i was unjustly banned without cause plain and simple and they r too high up on their horse to care about innocent players and they ignore
 the bad ones

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention the suspension being upheld. And that it was for the same reason as the first time. Have you taken a moment to read this information about how suspensions are issued&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/whatshappening/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/whatshappening/news</a>,
 it may some of your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind the Enforcement team does not use the forums and if their decision is upheld, there is nothing further anyone can do. Only an Enforcement Team member can assist with any specific suspension items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have suggestions on ways the process can be improved, it's best posted at&nbsp;<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/</a></p>

<p>to have received the communications ban you would have had to have sent a message/chat that was deemed to have broken the xbox live code of conduct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to players cheating/modding your best option is to record them ding this and then send this into the games developer through their forums as they can ban players seperately to microsoft, This is the most effective way to have a cheater banned
 as its not so easy for the xbox enforcement team to do this as you cannot submit video evidence with your report to microsoft.</p>

            Nobody gets a 2 week ban for nothing, I'd recommend reviewing the code of conduct. Accusing people of cheating in any manner can be considered harassment.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t accept my product key</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install windows vista 32bit on my laptop.&nbsp; I have the original product key on a sticker but do not have any installation disks. I have an OEM Vista 32bit disk from another rcomputer I own, and have been using this to try and re-install my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am having is that when I enter the product key - I get the error message saying the key is invalid - when I know that the key is for 32bit vista home premium, and the disk is also 32bit vista home premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I can do???</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the OEM disk from the other Computer was supplied by the Manufacturer, or you made it from the Recovery Partition on the other Computer, no, you can't use it on the one you are trying to reinstall Vista&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>____________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;may assist you (download the files and make your own DVD):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/57-windows-vista-direct-download-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/57-windows-vista-direct-download-links</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista using their Recovery Disk/s, you Boot from the 1st Recovery&nbsp;Disk they supply&nbsp;and follow the Manufacturer's instructions to reinstall:</p>
<p>You will have to change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD Drive 1st in the Boot Order:</p>
<p>How to change the Boot Order in BIOS:</p>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

    <title>Nat type and Disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nat type and Disconnecting</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Belkin N router. I have set up a manual ip address and opened all the ports needed for xbox. I still have a strict nat type. I have no firewall on my router and no password. I have bought a Wireless N adapter for my xbox to improve connection (
 I have a wireless connection). I randomly disconnect from mw3 and it signs me out from xbox live. This happens almost every game. Very rarely will I last a entire game without me disconnecting and xbox live being signed out. My connection is fine I have 4
 bars every game on mw3 and I dont lag at all. But it freezes the game and then disconnects me from xbox live. This happens to me also on Call of Duty Black ops. I do not know why it does this. By the way, there are 3 computers connected to my router, two ipods
 and one ipad. Help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have had a Strict NAT problem before if you can access you Wireless settings try and change your channel to 11.
</p>
<p>Tell me if this has resolved the problem, If not I will try and help you even more.</p>

<p>This will not affect none of your computers or devices to the router, &nbsp;Changing channels can fix the NAT type sometimes but it's worth the try. And changing channel also stops internet interference and that's probably one of the reasons you are disconnecting
 and getting Strict NAT. </p>

<p>I had good connection and I was in a party with my friend for one game. Then the second game, it started to get all laggy and then it said my friend had left my party. It was really me and my connection problem. It froze and signed me out of xbox live. I
 have changed my channel to 11. Nat type still is strict. I dont think the channel thing worked.</p>

<p>To be exact of what happens during the disconnection, me and the people around me lag around everywhere. Then it will freeze for a second or two, then it will boot me out saying server disconnection or whatever. I then either am able to find another game
 (the problem happens again in that game) or i get signed out of xbox live. Please help since I want to enjoy mw3. The nat type really isnt a problem right now, its the fact that I get booted from the servers all the time. Also, this happens on all the call
 of duty games, not just mw3.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>As Shad0wmanUK already suggested, please tell us the exact make and model of your Belkin router. Also, a lot of Belkin routers require an external broadband modem (i.e. cable or DSL modem) to connect online. Sometimes these modems you get from your Internet
 Provider also have NAT functions built in, which means, that despite having configured the Belkin correctly, the router modem "in front" of the Belkin is causing the strict NAT. Please provide the exact make and model of your modem, too.</p>
<p>[quote user="The Guns Master"]</p>
<p>I randomly disconnect from mw3 and it signs me out from xbox live. ... This happens to me also on Call of Duty Black ops. ...</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Do other games that are not flooded by modding cheats (e.g. less popular multiplayer games like Forza 3, or Arcade games like Castle Crashers or something like that) also cause you to become disconnected from Xbox Live? Because
 some pimple faced script kiddies with no skill sometimes proxy their console through their PCs so they can see from which IP their opponents connect, and then send them insane amounts of garbage data to an enemy. If their internet line has more capacity than
 your internet connection, the excess flood of garbage causes your Internet connection to become "clogged up", so you get disconnected.</p>
<p>So if other, less hacker-frequented games work flawlessly, there is nothing wrong with your internet configuration.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tip with changing the WiFi Channel might also be causing the disconnects. If neighbouring WLANs are broadcasting on the same channel, you will get interference, which disturbs each others signal. Try to use
 a non overlapping channel to your neighbouring WLANS like 1, 6 or 11. </p>

<p>Ok so to be exact, when I run a xbox live connection test with upnp enabled, no ports forwarded, and an automatic ip address I get an open nat. But that nat type stays open for about 12 hours until it changes to strict. I then can disconnect and reconnect
 and it will change to open again for a while. Keep in mind having the open nat does not change the frequent disconnects that I have. If I forward ports, and have a manual ip address on my xbox (I can put the manual ip address in DMZ but I have no firewall
 on so it does not matter) I get a strict nat witht he error on service alert. It gives me the suggestions to change my nat which do not work.</p>
<p>My have a belkin "N" router F5D8233-4v3. I have a modem connected to my router and a cable connected to my modem. The router is connected to my computer with a ethernet cable. I purchased the newest wireless adapter (the black adapter) for my xbox. It is
 the external adapter the one that is connected to the xbox through a usb cable. </p>
<p>When I play arcade games with less online players, I do have a better connection. I know it is because there aren't millions of people playing the game. I do not think that I am being disconnected by a hacker every time I join a game on mw3 however. Also
 on call of duty black ops, I do not think that is the case. My friends on xbox never have that problem to when they are in the lobby with me. I have changed the channel to 11 but that has not helped at all.

<h2>            HP Scanjet 4890 compatibilty issue</h2>
                    <strong>From: nisme</strong><br />
<br />
<p>I have bought this product in November 2006 and shortly after I had to ask for a replacement as the product did not work correctly in the scanning mode. Now to my surprise - after having bought and changed
 to Windows Vista on my HP computer - that I cannot get the software to my ScanJet 4890, which should be the newest model from HP.&nbsp; What a lousy company. You can of course use the windows scanning program but it is very slow. Has anybody a solution to this
 problem?</p>

            Hi Jonathan. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Sometimes if the User account gets corrupted and cannot start, Windows will sign you into a temporary account. A Temp Account cannot be used as a normal account. I'll give you everything that can be done to repair or replace your account, based on helping countless
 others get through it. <br />
<br />
1) Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it can sign into your account. <br />
<br />
2) Check at C:\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact. If not check at C:\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.
<br />
<br />
If so copy the files out externally so they are safe. Files should always be backed up if you value them at all. You can copy or drag them to an external USB flash or hard drive, or into Onedrive (up to 5gb free) or Google Drive (up to 15gb free).
<br />
<br />
3) From the temp account can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:
<br />

<br />
<br />
4) If not then you can try to create a new Admininstrator Local Account to see how it works:

https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>. <br />
<br />
5) If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:

https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>. <br />
<br />
6) If no other method works you may need to create Windows installation media to boot into to access the Command Prompt at boot to perform Option 5 above:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>. Detailed steps to boot media are in the tutorial in Step 12 below.
<br />
<br />
7) Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run. If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old accounts when ready in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.
<br />
<br />
8) If the install is too corrupted for even a new account to run well or you want to invest the time in trying to fix the old account, then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs
 get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
9) If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:
<a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> <br />
<br />
10) If nothing else works to fix the install try running a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place, by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This will solve most
 problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
11) If those fail then you can do a Reset: http://www.****/articles/reset-windows...
<br />
<br />
12) Or you can use the bootable media from Step 6 to do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to rescue your files using this method:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial. It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />

            Hi Jonathan, most likely you are in a Temporary Profile 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around 
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours? 
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time 
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

<h2>            Games&#40;especially PUBG&#41; keep constantly crashing</h2>
                    Hello, I recently built a new computer and whenever I play pubg it constantly crashes. I have done a lot of research and tried a lot of things but still nothing works. Mainly I get crashes saying "bad module info" or "serialization error corrupt data".
 Sometimes it crashes in game and whenever I try to rejoin the game crashes. or sometimes it is right on boot of the game. I have tried verifying the integrity of game files, they were fine. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game multiple times, I have
 reinstalled windows, ive uninstalled and reinstalled of my memory and graphics drivers, and I have ran full tests on my memory to see if it was faulty ram or storage. All tests and things that I have tried have came up negative and I am unsure what to do.
 When reading online it said it could be an issue with windows game bar, or playing windowed full screen opposed to fullscreen. I have uninstalled game bar and played both yet that has done nothing. I have heard sometimes its an issue to do with the new windows
 update, however when I uninstall it the game doesnt work at all and windows forces a reinstall of the update. I really dont know what is going on but it has been rather frustrating because I cannot play pubg on this new computer I built for that among other
 things. Please help me out here.<br />
<br />
My specs:<br />
CPU: i7 8700k<br />
GPU: ASUS ROG Strix 1080 ti<br />
MOBO: ASUS z370-e gaming<br />
RAM: 2x8GB G.Skill Trident Z RGB

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you tried opening the system unit then check if the video card is installed and secured properly?
<br />
<br />Also, if you are running Windows 10 1709, I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Windows 10 1703 is the previous version of WIndows 10. 
<br />
<br />Installing Windows 10 1703 would require backing up your files and your applications would need to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do that, then I recommend you perform a repair upgrade:

<h2>            Sporadic crashes --- insight needed</h2>
                    <p>My computer will randomly blue screen from time to time. Sometimes it would be fine for a month and then BSOD. Sometimes it would completely just BSOD from start up. Sometimes it would let me log in and then after a few minutes of use BSOD again. I've attached
 a link to my most recent dump files as my computer has been crashing for the past three days and finally decided to rest up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before I get suggestions, Yes, I have already tried options such a system restore, restore points (never finished), system refresh, chdsk, scndsk, clean boot from safe mode. The only thing that I can really think of are faulty drivers or a corrupted hard
 drive. I have not run a memtest. However, in the past I have done memory diagnostic in which I am not sure where to receive the report that it should have generated. I checked the event viewer but there ere no results which could mean the test did not even
 finish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please take a look and give me a possible diagnosis? This has been a long occurring problem.</p>

<em>This indicates that a problem occurred in the file system's cache manager.</em><br />

One possible cause of this bug check is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low,
 another kernel-mode driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There were many different Bug_Check which usually indicate hardware. What I would do is<br />
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>backup your data off the main driver, to removable media is best, and then re-install Windows.<br />
If that helps update the BIOS, chipset, and all the major drivers. If not it is hardware.<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible)<br />
- actually remove and replace - do not snug.<br />

</p><p>Funny thing is I had Norton before and that might have caused BSOD. Now it's AVAST! I'm running out of ideas for anti virus software... haha. could you recommend one stable with 8.1? currently I just have defender and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</p>

Windows Defender in Windows 8/8.1 is a full antivirus so you do not need to add one.

            <p>I'm trying to backup my files. However, just as the download is a bout to finish my computer BSODs and the download fails. I have error.txt, but when i open them, they are blank. Any ideas? I still have warranty from HP to call in my comp. Using that as
 a last resort as I was told that if they replace your hard drive, then you will not get your programs or OS back... is that correct? (Programs such as MS Office). Are there other ways of backing up files? File history doesn't seem to be cutting it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*Edit: I was able to backup my files on a low resolution boot mode. Possible that my graphics drivers are faulty?</p>

    <title>Type Cover 2 faulty angle detection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dax&#169;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Type Cover 2 faulty angle detection</h2>
                    <p>Recently, coinciding with the most recent updates, my Type Cover 2 has ceased to work correctly.</p>
<p>It will work when it is at a 90°angle or léss when attached to the Surface 2.</p>
<p>It will properly disable itself when exceeding about 150° relative to the Surface 2 to all the way folding back.</p>
<p>But when the Surface 2 is on a desk and set at either default kickstand positions, the Type Cover 2 is unresponsive.</p>
<p>When it works at the 90° angle oftentimes when very slowly moving it to one of the kickstanded angles it will continue to function, but any rapid movement and it is once again disabled. It is asif the default angle detection to disable/enable the Type Cover
 2 when folded back or folded to the screen has somehow narrowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Device Manager I can see an exclamation mark in front of Touch Interface</p>
<p>The error message there is code 10<span>&nbsp; </span>failed to initialize</p>

<p>I've run System File Checker and it finishes with zero errors found.</p>
<p>I have attempted to update the driver for Touch Interface but it returns no updates found; also<span>&nbsp;
</span>rolling back the driver option is greyed. I have disabled and re enabled the Touch Interface but this particular error persists.</p>
<p>I have cleaned the Type Cover 2's connectors.</p>
<p>I have also run all the various troubleshooters, and<span>&nbsp; </span>the issues persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Touch Cover 1 works pretty much fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of a way to perhaps reflash the typecover 2's firmware?</p>
<p>Or<span>&nbsp; </span>how the on/off switching of the type cover 2 works? Is there a physical switch of some sort which could be faulty, or motion/angle sensing parameters within the Registry I could try to tweak?</p>

<p>Interesting. &nbsp;I was wondering if the Marvel vs. Capcom line would be affected.</p>
<p>I am still disappointed over the removal of DLC and other material related to the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games. &nbsp;The ferocity of licensing/copyright issues gets so old, especially when you've already paid for content.</p>

I've had to do that with the Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2 DLC.</p>

<p>VoteDC, you are completely right. &nbsp;I wasn't clear in my statement - I wish I could still purchase DLC for these games, as I still have the games themselves. &nbsp;This just isn't an option due to the licensing removal.

<p>it was to do with&nbsp; the rights expiring. if the digital download future is ever going to take off then they will have to find a way round this so they can leave it up after the rights expire. they should sort it out so right expiring only means that studio
 can't make any new games of that franchise </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The People app is your address book. You can add your contacts and keep in touch with friends and family. Just to clarify, which version and build of Windows device are you using? To verify your Windows, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> to open the Run window. Type <strong>WINVER</strong> and press Enter. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device. This will help us to isolate your concern.</p>

<p>The info in my 1st and 2nd posts above should provide the People Icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, In short:</p>
<p>Right-click the taskbar</p>
<p>Click Taskbar settings</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of that page and look in the 'People' section</p>
<p>Click 'Show Contacts on the taskbar' to ON</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make the people icon&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c72cb9e-85b0-4a48-9463-1b8ec8c3bc29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c72cb9e-85b0-4a48-9463-1b8ec8c3bc29?upload=true" /></a>

 professional edition. Is there any way to activate windows 10 from trial edition to pro edition?</p>

            Hi Gareth.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the Pro version retail?  If so you can transfer it's license it to the new PC.  
<br />
<br />First try inserting the Generic Pro key into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation to change to Pro version:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>.  If necessary go offline to do this by clicking on Action Center at right end of task bar and choose Airplane Mode.
<br />
<br />Then once it's changed to Pro activate with the Pro key in the same place.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Gareth,
<br />
<br />If the Windows 10 Pro is a retail Licence (Purchased separately to the laptop) then it can be transferred to the PC, if it is an OEM licence (came Pre-installed on the laptop), it cannot be transferred . . .

<p>Hey Piesang,</p>
<p>Seems like the mouse driver currently installed doesn’t support this feature.</p>
<p>Microsoft intellipoint software enables you to customize the action of your Microsoft® mouse such as scroll wheel button.&nbsp; You can reassign mouse buttons to perform commands, shortcuts, and application-specific functions. You can also modify mouse settings,
 such as pointer speed and updated horizontal scrolling.<br />
Download the software from the link below after which you should be able to get the required functionality.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Halifax,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to incorrect entry of password on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you check if the password entered is correct or not?</span></li><li><span>Which is the latest update installed on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the password entered on the computer is correct by clicking on the icon located next to the password entry box after entering the password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the typed password is correct, boot the computer in
<strong>Safe mode with networking</strong> and check if similar issue persists on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select appropriate options to boot the computer into
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></a>. <strong>Reboot</strong> the computer to exit from

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, you can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows
 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.</span>

            Hi Simons,
<br />What is the make and model of the printer?
<br />
<br />The first step would be to try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />
<br />\In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.
        </p>

<p>When I try to print any document in Windows, it creates a "Save print output as" and brings up File explorer.</p>

            The printer might need a service. I would suggest you to ask on HP forums as they know their product better.

<h3> waleedamir98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen times out while gaming&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have windows 10 pro installed on my laptop. I play games on my laptop using xbox 360 wireless controller. The issue is that when i am playing any game the display times out as if i am not using it and pc is on stand by. It is like i have left my pc turned
 on and not use it and it turns off the display( after 5 minutes becuz my display timeout is set to 5 min). The display only turns on when i press a button on keyboard or when i touch the touchpad. Pressing buttons of controller has no effect. The issue started
 after i upgraded to windows 10 creators update. Gaming was perfectly fine before creators update. Please tell me how to fix this issue. If you need any more info please tell me. Thanks in advance.

            I pretty sure that there is no problem with the controller. I have no other pc to check it. But i think there is some issue with the new windows update.

            I don't know why to run the apps troubleshooter. Because i don't have any app or game insalled from the windows store. So what is the point in running the app troubleshooter.

<h2>            error 800705b4 with windows update</h2>
                    ONLY when I install MSC definition updates, I get a failed error 800705b4. when I click on 'try again', it completes very quickly. In reviewing the update history,the last update that was installed before the failed updates started was:Update for Microsoft
 .NET Framework 4 KB2468871:&nbsp; Do you have any suggestions?

            as I stated previously, on 8/11/2011, I installed [Update for Microsoft .Net Framework 4 on Windows XP,Windows Server 2003,Windows Vista,Windows 7,Windows Server 2008,Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64 based Systems (KB2468871)].<br />
since then, every automatic update for "Definition Update for Microsoft Security Essentials"has failed INITIALLY when I MANUALLY install the update, it is successful.
<br />
The failed install returns an 800705B4 error. Recently,(9/11/2011), I uninstalled Microsoft Security Essentials and downloaded and re-installed&nbsp; the program. It seems to be working now, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.<br />
