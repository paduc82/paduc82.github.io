    <title>Windows 7 backup no longer runs with Windows 10 build 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup no longer runs with Windows 10 build 1809</h2>
                    <p>I normally do a system backup weekly using the Windows 7 backup only because it has more granularity in implementing than the Windows 10 update does. Primarily, I can run it when I want to and Windows 10 doesn't give that option. I back up to a USB 1 TB
 drive and have been doing this weekly for over 2 years now. Yesterday when I tried to run it, I got the following error message: "Check your backup The last backup did not complete successfully"</p>
<p>The media is write protected<br />
error code: 0x80070013</p>
<p>So I formatted the drive, checked permissions and ran it again. I have done this 4 times now and get the same result. The drive isn't write protected and it does create a backup of over 400 GB before it gives the failure message. So how can it be a write
 protected problem when it can wrtie that much data before the failure message? This isn't a devastating problem since I use Acronis backup to a NAS and another program called Second Copy to back up all my data folders to my NAS, so the USB drive was a redundant
 backup as well as the Second Copy program does for my data. So I primarily used Windows 7 backup to backup all the system files and created an image of my C: drive that has the operating system on it. All Data is on a secondary drive. The data being on my
 secondary drive may have been why updating to version 1809 didn't delete any of my user data folders?&nbsp; Anyway, you can never have too many backups and I would like to continue using this USB drive for the operating system. I thought I read somewhere that version
 1809 would not allow you to use Windows 7 backup anymore? That would seem odd to me since the option is still there and it does run, just not completely. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance....</p>

<p>Thank you Suman, but if you read my post completely, I did say that I was using a USB drive for backup. And I did try copy files to it after the failure. I also ran diskpart to make sure it wasn't somehow changing over to read only. After I format it, which
 I have now done 5 times, the hard drive shows 931 GB of free space to write to. I have also ran chckdisk and it reports that the drive is fine. I would try another drive to see if the backup would complete but I don't have a spare 1 TB drive laying around.&nbsp;
 I attached a screen shot of the files it is creating so it's writing fine up to a point and then it stops and gives me the error message. I have my backup set to run every Sunday at 10:00 AM and it has always ran without a problem until I updated to Windows
 version 1809. I have never had any problems with the backup running after any other update so I am at a loss. The hard drive is obviously not write protected so I do not understand the failure with the write protected message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backup and Restore (Windows 7) was included in Windows 10 so that people who used it in Windows 7 to make backups can restore those backups in Windows 10. It's not supported for making new backups in Windows 10, so you can't rely on it for making new backups,
 as you have discovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make image backups you need third-party image backup software, like <a href="https://www.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Macrium Reflect</a>. There are actually many great image backup applications. You can find them by searching the web for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 10 image backup software 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your search results will include reviews by professional reviewers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making regular image backups is an excellent idea, but why only once a week? A third-party application can make an image in minutes, easily and automatically. Reflect makes my images overnight while I'm asleep.</p>

<p>Suman,</p>
<p>Thank you once again and I have purchased and am downloading Macrium Reflect as I write this. I do use both Dropbox and Google drive to backup created content as it's created and so I have a redundancy for offline backup and use my NAS for weekly backups
 locally. I do use Acronis for data and a system image weekly, and I do create a backup before any system updates, but even though I understand that Windows 7 backup, which I used with Windows 7, is not supported for Windows 10, but what I don't understand
 is why it has ran without error for 2 years and never failed until the update to version 1809, nor why it does run and creates over 400 GB of data and then gives the write protect error message when the drive is obviously not write protected? So we all have
 reason for doing things differently and mine might be a little strange, but at least I do backup on a regular basis. Thanks again for your time.</p>

<p>1- I would not backup to cloud storage. Uploading pictures taken with my phone's camera is one thing, but an entire backup? Wouldn't do it. For most ISPs, upload speed is much slower than download. (Verizon FIOS in the U.S. is an exception.) It would take
 all day to upload my backup, and if anything happens to my internet connection during that time ... oops, too bad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Just because something ran well in the past doesn't necessarily mean it will continue to run well in the future. Windows 10 is being continuously updated, while B&amp;R (Win 7) is not. Eventually it's just not going to work properly with all that new code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>True Image is good, Reflect is good, ShadowProtect is good (but expensive!) Whatever works for you.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. I back up only data to the cloud, (pictures, documents and music backup) and all the pictures on my phone. I have never tried a system backup and due to time and bandwidth, wouldn't begin to try that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- I agree that what worked in the past doesn't always work going forward, however, once again, this worked flawlessly for 2 years and produced the error after upgrading to 1809 which I mainly find odd. And odd for 2 reasons, it copies over 400 GB before
 failing with the write protect error message, which makes no sense since I can copy more files to the drive that Windows now can't, and normally when Microsoft decides to discontinue support for something, they normally tell you, since they are much more legacy
 supportive than Apple, but not always, admittedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for the Reflect suggestion since it is very easy to set up, many, many options and much quicker at writing the image than True Image or the Windows 7 backup program. So I have now changed my regimen and accept this post as closed since my problem
 no longer is of any concern becuase I no longer use the Windows 7 backup. Might be a good reference if any other users have the same problem since I can't be the only idiot using Windows 7 backup?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            edge browser and its settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As nice as it may look and feel, the Edge browser does feel a bit unfinished. So here are my questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Changing the technology behind it does mean that Sopcast plugin will not work anymore as it did with IE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a deeper way into its settings other than about:flags? I'm interested for example in changing the default location for downloads, clearing cache on exit, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Does it have any relation with the Internet Options as IE did or the&nbsp; Internet options remains just an useless appendix yet to be removed?</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the plugin, I would suggest you to check with the program vendor for its compatibility with Microsoft Edge.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Internet options is not connected with Microsoft Edge. You can still use it for Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you use the Feedback app to leave your findings, comments and feedback related to this product.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Members of the Windows Insider Program can provide feedback about the Windows 10 directly to our engineers by using the Windows Feedback app.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also use the feedback option from within the Microsoft Edge. Open Microsoft Edge app, click on the three dots on the right hand top corner of the page. Click on

<h2>            Skype for Business on Mac - Invitations from Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi:&nbsp; I am working from home on a Mac with Mojave, using Outlook and Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send a Skype meeting invitation through Outlook, I get a note in the invite window saying that the Skype information will be added after I send the invitation.&nbsp; OK, but it puts the meeting information at the very bottom of the email thread, which
 might be very long if there was an extensive conversation before deciding to set up the meeting (that happens a lot).&nbsp; When I am in my company office, I work on a Windows machine and the Skype meeting information shows at the very top of the invitation, where
 it can be seen immediately by the invitees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get Skype to show the meeting information at the top of the Outlook invitation on a Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

</p><p>Hi PeerJ407,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification, the Online Meeting in outlook for Mac is the same as Skype Meeting in Outlook for windows. It won't affect meeting, if you want to let Join online meeting option always on the top in Outlook for Mac, it's not feasible to get
 this when creating skype meeting, you may need to finish creating a Skype meeting firstly, after the Join online meeting option was added to meeting, you can double-click and change the meeting information. To delete the meeting information above and add update
 information below like following image. You may use this as a workaround.</p>

</p><p>Cleaning the contacts helped me.&nbsp; But it really doesn't work that well with W10 and I certainly do not like typing with the thing to any extent at all.&nbsp; I use a wireless mouse and keyboard or Remote Desktop instead.&nbsp; MouseWithoutBorders is another good alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Type

    <title>Hunt for a Tow truck online - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hunt for a Tow truck online</h2>
                    
<p>It seems that no one anywhere has found a tow truck online. This is the last vehicle I want for my garage (a dune buggy would be a nice second, but those apparently aren't online either and probably couldn't be saved anyways), so I'm constantly on the lookout
 for it. If anyone finds one, please leave a pic of your character with the truck and lemme know how to find it. I'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p>To be truthful I haven't seen it any were my self, and they possibly don't want people to have it noticing it would be a troll like the Cargobob, go off and steal some ones car and run for it. Certain things aren't on the online like the single player has.
 I really wouldn't mind have a dune buggy or most of the stuff I like from single player but a lot of that isn't added on it and who knows if it will be.</p>

<p>Technically if I were to tow your car towards the water near the helipad release it at speed and pull away your car would roll into the water and I didnt do it. Works the same as the cargobob if i lift the car into the air and release it above water I didnt
 do it</p>

<p>Well like I said, I'm convinced the Tow Truck can't be found online. However if someone finds one before I do, and can get in my game and ride in it till I find one also, I'll give them a generous reward (80k is my current account summary).</p>

<p>I've noticed, but if I can't transfer it directly I can just place bounties on a third party repeatedly. I just spent a large amount on car upgrades though, so my reward will probably need to come from the 500k stimulus deal.</p>

<p>They should just spawn it inside the Davis Sheriff Impound Lot. It would deter most from stealing it as you need to literally go into the Impound Lot to retrieve it. There's no more retractable gate like in SP. A player would also have to literally enter
 the premises, thus tipping off the nearby guards who will open fire and give the player a two-star wanted level. Driving a slow Tow Truck with a Two-Star Wanted Level, good chance you ain't getting away unless you have Lester.</p>

<p>They don't spawn in the impound trust me camped it for a few in game days. I've only seen one it was the small tow truck and I blew it up with a buzzard running from 5 stars. I did confirm it was the truck with ground forces finding the wreckage. I think
 it was a bugged spawn as my friends that found it blown up had just came out of a mission and this was during the cloud going down every 10 mins too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Still have yet to find another one it was near Sandy Shores air field right before the trailer park area where Trevor lives.

    <title>Can&#39;t fix BSOD IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fluffy283  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t fix BSOD IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>My boyfriend is running Vista Ultimate 32-bit. When his computer starts up Windows boots as usual and lets me log in, but after a few things load the computer crashes and the infamous BSOD about IRQL appears and the computer "shuts down to protect data".
 I can log in and stay logged in if I use Safe Mode but this means I can't use Windows Update, and the Security Center can't be activated. I have tried defragmenting his C drive several times but it isn't making any difference.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers I get on the BSOD:</p>
<p>STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000000, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8283483C)</p>
<p>Then it performs a physical memory dump.</p>
<p>The other day I removed a worm called "Security Protection" from his C drive and I installed Spybot, then AdAware. I had to uninstall AdAware, and installed avast! in its place. Today, I have reversed everything done by avast! and Spybot and I then uninstalled
 them&nbsp;as suggested by the Microsoft Support site. Windows has improved slightly by giving a consistently working startup. But because of the IRQL error, as I said, only Safe Mode is functioning correctly.</p>
<p>On this computer, there is no Startup Repair. There are no System Restore Points [which is frustrating enough], and&nbsp;I don't want to try updating his drivers because there are so many and I don't know what they do. I have tried using F8 to enter Debugging
 Mode, but that just freezes the computer at the logo screen and I have to physically restart his computer. I have looked at the Event Viewer and there are a lot of messages and they don't make any sense to me. Problems and Solutions in the Control Panel reports
 no errors.</p>
<p>He has no Vista disk and he isn't willing to lose all of his data.</p>
<p>I have seen this error message on his computer before but I simply restarted the computer and the message didn't come back. Now it won't stop. I couldn't find anything on the Support site that fixes this and I don't want to download a hotfix because it says
 that IF the hotfix I choose is incorrect, it could cause system damage. I tried to use the Contact feature but it told me that the Product ID on his computer is expired.</p>
<p>I'm at the end of my wits, I've tried everything I can think of to fix this, I've read several websites and articles and nothing is working.</p>

            <p>In Safe mode, can you configure the computer&nbsp;to "clean boot" and then see if you can start the computer in "Normal mode" - follow Step 1 only&nbsp;to clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the&nbsp;BSODs with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>
<p>If you are unable to start the computer in Normal Mode you can access the minidump files in Safe Mode.</p>

1. Check with Acer Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major drivers especially<br />
the Bluetooth drivers. Then check at the actual OEM device maker's sites for even newer versions.<br />

==========================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to<br />
see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card
<br />
or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> - set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (also update the BIOS and<br />
low level chipset drivers)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

 the top of the page)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Update 8 -19 -2015</p>
<p>I can understand wanting to have a shortcut on the desktop for an ap.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<div><br />
With reference to zigzag3143x, I would suggest you to refer the following Microsoft article and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also make sure that you have disconnected all the external devices except mouse and keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Before Reinstalling Windows 7, I would recommend you to Back up your files using windows backup.<br />

            <p>Far away, but in the same building, I assume...</p>
<p>You need a long <em>'Crossover</em>' LAN cable if connecting directly between machines.</p>
<p>More commonly would be to connect through the Modem, so you could put the modem half way if</p>
<p>you can't find a cable that that is long enough to reach the second machine. But you would need a phone</p>
<p>plug near the modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are also special LAN adapters that plug into power outlets which use the&nbsp; buildings electrical wiring as a LAN cable. This option saves having to route a LAN cable to another area in the building.</p>
<p>- Or use a wireless modem, but each machine has to have wi-fi&nbsp; as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You also need to setup permissions between the machines if you want to share stuff.</p>
<p>I don't do this often, and manage to stumble through the setup when it's necessary, but there would be</p>
<p>tutorials that can be found with a www search.</p>

<p>Yes, it's a PC running windows 10.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't notice the format.&nbsp; I will have to check that tonight.<br />
But all the songs had a cloud beside them with a down arrow.&nbsp; And as soon as I hit the arrow that's when the error occurred.&nbsp; I tried quite a few of them and they all came back with the same error.&nbsp; This is my daughter's music and she has over a 1,000 songs
 and probably have of them are this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help you can give.</p>

    <title>Windows wont load drivers for USB Midi controller... Device cannot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows wont load drivers for USB Midi controller... Device cannot start &#40;error 10&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a DJ-Tech Mixer One controller that is plug &amp; play. I have used it on my desktop (Win 7 x64) and it loads drivers just fine. I just bought a new HP Laptop with Win 7 x64 but when I plug in the controller it says the device drivers failed to load.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Manager
 there is&nbsp;a yellow triangle next to the deivce&nbsp;and it says Device cannot start (error 10).</p>
<p>I have tried updating, reinstalling. I have tried uninstalling all the USB ports. I even did a clean install of Windows to make sure there were no conflicts but it still does the same thing. I have tried the Microsoft USB Troubleshooting App which detects
 the problem, tries to reinstall the drivers but fails.</p>
<p>I called HP but they have no idea. I can take the Midi Controller over to my desktop, plug it in and it works fine. I compared the list of drivers from my desktop and they are the same ones on my laptop. I have other controllers and USB devices working perfectly
 on my laptop also so I know it's not the USB ports.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/</span></a><br />
<br />
If the device works on other systems with the same OS then the problem has to be related to the<br />
HP and most likely&nbsp;the USB ports. Try other ports, some are probably powered and some are not<br />
and the powered ports are more likely to work. Try using a Powered USB Hub which is not expensive.<br />
<br />
Possibly a Repair Installation can help which allows you to keep the programs and data though<br />
redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />

<br />
My 1st best guess is the HP laptop does not have the available power needed by the device.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />I Don't clearly catch what you really want.
<br />&gt;Window 10 keeps removing chrome . 
<br />&gt; Then will not let me uninstall. 
<br />
<br />Can't you Apply this ?
<br />On your computer, close all Chrome windows and tabs.
<br />Click the Start menu   Settings.
<br />Click Apps.
<br />Under "Apps &amp; features," find and click Google Chrome.
<br />Click Uninstall.
<br />Confirm by clicking Uninstall.
<br />To delete your profile information, like bookmarks and history, check "Also delete your browsing data."
<br />Click Uninstall..

<br />Out of curiosity is this a work PC?
<br />If so could be a policy removing Chrome... we do that on our corporate workstations.

<br />
<br />Uninstall Chrome in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps and Features.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; enable Show Hidden Files, approve security box, Apply, Save.   
<br />
<br />Delete all Chrome sub-folders within Google folders in C:\Users\Your User Account name and in both C:\Program Files folders.  Restart PC again.
<br />
<br />Reinstall Chrome from a fresh download here: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a>
<br />
<br />Observe closely after adding any Extensions or making any other changes if these affect Chrome.  The problem is likely with one of those, or a conflict with another program.  Are any other programs problematic?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>A couple of questions.&nbsp; Is it really a PATA drive or a SATA drive?&nbsp; To my knowledge, W7 and prior used the SATA format while W8 forward uses the EUFI format.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your definition of "erasing" a drive?&nbsp; Is the PC really a x86 or a x64?&nbsp; You need to be careful switching between x86 and x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a little herd of W7 and W8 era HPs.&nbsp; I often swap hard drives.&nbsp; If I need to put a W7 HD into a W8 era HP, I need to go to BIOS to change to Legacy so that the W8 PC can read the W7 format.&nbsp; If I need to put a W8 hard drive into a W7 era HP, I then
 use AOMEI to format the W8 HD into the W7 format.&nbsp; I do not lose data in the formatting of the HD when I use AOMEI.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently took a Vista x86 Home and I just fed it W10 x86 Home without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps more data will get you better results.</p>

            <p>I would start over. First check for any BIOS updates from the motherboard or OEM maker and install that. Set BIOS to Factory or Optimal defaults. A PATA (IDE) drive should be no problem. In a Generation 1 (Legacy BIOS) Hyper-V Virtual Machine, an IDE drive
 is required to be the boot device, even if you also have a SCSI interface installed, so I assume this is true on physical devices also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot from Windows 10 install media on USB or DVD. Choose Custom install. First delete all partitions from the disk until it only has unpartitioned space. Then install Windows to that space and it will be&nbsp;partitioned according to Windows 10 defaults. On an
 MBR disk, that is normally a 500MB System/Recovery NTFS partition followed by one large NTFS partition for the rest of the disk. But Windows setup will do that for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the drive is failing in some way and is developing bad sectors. The new install may have tried to write to these, while they were relatively dormant in the previous install, with some large data file residing there. If the system has any
 diagnostics you can try to run those, or run chkdsk with a surface scan to mark any bad sectors so that&nbsp;they will be isolated from any write attempts.</p>

            <p><strong>Thanks: Mel,</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of questions.&nbsp; Is it really a PATA drive or a SATA drive?&nbsp; To my knowledge, W7 and prior used the SATA format while W8 forward uses the EUFI format.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Not being smart:</strong> Parallel ATA (PATA), originally AT Attachment, is an interface standard for the connection of
</p>
<p>storage devices such as hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, and optical disc drives in computers. The standard is
</p>
<p>maintained by the X3/INCITS committee.&nbsp; It uses the underlying AT Attachment (ATA) and AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) standards.<br />
&nbsp;Serial ATA (SATA, abbreviated from Serial AT is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass
</p>
<p>storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives</p>
<p>&nbsp; What is your definition of "erasing" a drive?&nbsp; Is the PC really a x86 or a x64?&nbsp; You need to be careful switching between x86 and x64.<br />
&nbsp; Using A Partition Program to delete all&nbsp; Partitions and erasing the disc.&nbsp; This was done before trying to install the 64 bit Windows 10 and again before installing the 32 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Perhaps more data will get you better results.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Thanks: Don,</strong><br />
&nbsp; I would start over. First check for any BIOS updates from the motherboard. </p>
<p>Have not check for a BIOS update,&nbsp; <strong>Will Do.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; Boot from Windows 10 install media on USB or DVD. </p>
<p>In answer to Mel, I explain that I cleaned the disc prior to custom install. </p>
<p>&nbsp; It's possible that the drive is failing in some way and is developing bad sectors.
</p>
<p>New 160 GB PATA Hard Drive.&nbsp; Yes, it could be bad.&nbsp; I have in the past install new Hard Drives that were bad.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your machine still uses PATA drives, it may not be 100% compatible with Win 10...</p>
<p>Not necessarily because of the PATA drive, but for other hardware related issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, you do need to determine as to whether the motherboard is 64 bit capable or not... Again, a PATA era machine may not be...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were a lot of changes in Graphics with Win 8 and 10 that may be causing your machine to restart repeatedly, or some other driver issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the machine allow you to sign in before restarting ?</p>
<p>Did you use a Local Account, or a Microsoft Account as a log in ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try using your installation media to enter Safe Mode...</p>
<p>This could be risky if you use a USB keyboard as the keyboard drivers may not load in time for your keyboard to work at sign in...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot with your installation media like before, and select REPAIR on the lower left of the Install screen...&nbsp; Then click Troubleshoot... Then Advanced...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the Command prompt option and enter this for SafeBoot with Networking...</p>
<strong><span><span>
<p>bcdedit /set {default} safeboot network</p>
</span></span></strong><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Hit enter, close Command Prompt, and click the back arrow until you see the Continue to Win 10... Then click it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove your installation media before the restart...</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a driver issue of some type, SafeBoot (Safe Mode) may get you past the crash and enable you to better figure out what is happening...</p>

            <p>I wondered if the drive was older due to the PATA interface. It may have SMART analysis that can indicate if there are any issues with it. You can probably get a utility to check it out from the drive manufacturer or download one. One utility is
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/disk_smart_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DiskSMARTView</a> by Nirsoft, or Seagate's <a href="http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SeaTools</a> may help. Of course double check cables, connections, etc. But there should be no reason it is incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing 64-bit Windows on a 32-bit laptop recently and there was a clear message telling me what the issue was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes there are some chipset incompatibilities or you need to enable certain security features in your BIOS for Windows 10 to work right. There are a few older motherboards which are not compatible, even though the processor itself has the necessary
 capabilities. Here is a link to specifics on Windows 10 hardware requirements:</p>

<p>I am beginning to believe its the motherboard.&nbsp; It an ASUS A832-SLI Deluxe.&nbsp; The date in the manual list the Declaration of Conformity as Sept. 15, 2005.&nbsp; This may put it just out of the range to accept Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Devices that run Windows 10 for desktop editions require a 1 GHz or faster processor or SoC that meets the following requirements:</p>

<p>I don't think you mentioned which CPU you have installed. The 64-bit compatibility has to do with the last line listed above: CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and PrefetchW.</p>

            It is possible that outdated drivers may cause the <strong>Kernel Power 41</strong> error. Why not just try to update it, then see if the error message will be gone. If it's the same, you can roll back the graphic driver to its previous update.<br />
<br />
What is your PC antivirus? If it's an AVG antivirus, can you try temporarily uninstalling it to see if the issue will be resolved?<br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you’re done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em><br />
<br />
Let me know how it goes.

    <title>Skype Username Change. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meredithatwood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Username Change.</h2>
                    My Skype username changed out of the blue with this Microsoft update and login. How do I change it back and sync up so that I haven't lost ALL my contacts? I have looked at the forums and I am not seeing any of these as options.
