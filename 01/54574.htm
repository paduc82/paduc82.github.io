            <p>I also had faced the same problem in windows 7 computer. But in my case I encountered the problem after I issued the command sfc /scannow in command prompt. According to me may be it is because windows is not genuine or else you have installed some applications
 for crack. If it is due to this you can run the application again. In my case it fixed after I connected to the internet.</p>
<p>

                    <p class="contentCodeblock">Hello.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">I have troubles from a week ago, my Windows 8.1 (Pro K) crashed and cannot boot itself (of course safe mode too)</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">I asked before, but in that time, it seemed like to be a problem of aswSP.sys, but there are some dumps, and only one of dump points aswSP.sys, while the others points ntoskrnl.exe.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">ps. Autofix doesn't work at all, no recovery point, the only one I can use was Command Prompt on Setup USB.</p>

            <p>Hi Shobon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occur if the drivers are not updated or corrupted drivers for the hardware in the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In regards to the issue, I require&nbsp;additional information to make sure that helps us to resolve the issue easily:</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;Were there any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Does the blue screen error occur after plugging this device?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you made any recent hardware changes?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li><span>When exactly did you receive this error message?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<span>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Determine if you changed anything recently.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The most common cause of the Blue Screen is a recent change in your computer’s settings or hardware. This is often related to new drivers getting installed or updated. Drivers are software that allow your hardware to communicate
 with Windows. If you have a restore point, try to load it and see if it helps, it may or may not. Because there are essentially an infinite number of hardware configurations possible, drivers can’t be tested for every possible setup. This means that sometimes
 a driver will be installed that causes a critical error when communicating with the hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check your computer’s internal hardware.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sometimes, a poor connection inside the computer can cause a Blue Screen. Open your case and check to make sure that all the cables are firmly connected and that any cards are seated firmly in their sockets.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This is more difficult for laptops. You can check the hard drive and the RAM to make sure that they are connected properly. Remove the panels in the back that cover the hard drive and RAM with a small Phillips-head screwdriver.
 Press the components firmly into their connections.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check your computer’s temperature</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Overheating can lead to your hardware malfunctioning. One of the most common components to overheat is the graphics card. The second most likely culprit is the CPU.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can check temperatures in most BIOS menus, or through software in Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The MBR is the first sector of the computer hard drive that tells the computer how to load the operating system, how the hard drive is partitioned, and how to load the operating system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you are unable to boot the computer normally, let’s run Automatic repair and check if it resolves the issue. Follow the methods:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to perform automatic repair on the computer using Windows 8 installation DVD.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have a Windows 8.1 media, I would suggest you to refer to the link to create a Windows 8.1 installation media:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please follow the steps given below. Insert the Windows 8.1 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) Select the <strong>correct time</strong> and<strong> Keyboard

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2: Restore the computer to a point prior to the issue.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<h3> vaibhavdingre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why the call quality to Australia is worst&#63; And why I got charged at Rs.15&#47;minute&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought Skype Credits worth Rs.354.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if I can call on Australia numbers I called on a company telephone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got charged for Rs.15/minute as well as the call quality is so worst that neither I nor the called person could understand a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this what Skype boasts about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is so just refund my money and I will never use this junk app again in my life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also going to make sure that none of my concerned people ever use this junk in their life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just get lost in oblivion with your garbage services.</p>

                    <p>I googled and searched this forum but cannot find an answer of how to disable the cursor pop-ups when hovering over icons, folders and etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get the same pop up when using

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•&nbsp;Are you facing this issue on desktop icons and folders or only when you use Microsoft Outlook?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The option “Uncheck Popup Descriptions for Folder and Desktop Items” under folder option disables the pop up description only on desktop and folders on the computer not in the Microsoft Outlook.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are still getting cursor pop-ups even after you uncheck the option “Uncheck Popup Descriptions for Folder and Desktop Items” under folder option you can try creating new user account and check if you face similar issue.</div>

    <title>BSOD becoming more frequent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonibell  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD becoming more frequent</h2>
                    <p>The past month I have been having problems with crashes and BSODs with various error codes. I was experiencing either the computer turning itself off or giving me a BSOD every day. I contacted Dell to resolve the issue, and the GPU was replaced, which stopped
 the crashing problem and the daily BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the computer did BSOD ten days ago, and now twice today. I have tried installing updates, but the Windows Update program fails to install them and rolls them back, even though I tried using the Windows Update Diagnostic to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know if this is an update issue, or what. Sometimes the BSOD code is DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, but the last one was KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED. It seems to be different each time. Sometimes there isn't a code at all, just a sad face. I haven't
 noticed it happening when using specific applications, it seems to happen at any time.</p>

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 executable has stopped working</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>&nbsp;I've installed and run my Zoo tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection on my Windows 7 laptop successfully and it &nbsp;has now stopped working. When I try to load the game it changes the colour scheme to windows 7 basic and then a small black box comes up,it an error
 messagethen pops up saying: Zoo Tycoon 2 executable has stopped working and it closes the program. I tried changing settings in 'run programs made for previous versions of windows' but when it has checked the laptop Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection is not
 listed. My laptop meets the minimum system requirements and I have tried downloading a patch but it crashes right at the end of the installation. Any ideas?</div>

    <title>How or can we delete the first Windows 8 user&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> healee  say:</h3>
<h2>            How or can we delete the first Windows 8 user&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a laptop yesterday.&nbsp; It is a Windows 8 system.&nbsp; I have been using Wiindows operating system for ages that I care to remember.&nbsp; This is the worst one in terms of user-friendliness.&nbsp; I don't like it at all.&nbsp; All the apps runs without a menu at all
 by default.&nbsp; I am still finding out how to run everything so that I can manage them like in Windows 7.&nbsp; It hasn't got a touch screen.&nbsp; It is a really big learning curve.<br />
<br />
Today I set up the computer without a mouse.&nbsp; When I entered the first user name, accidentally the system went on to the next page before I finished typing and I couldn't go back.&nbsp; So I thought later on I could create another administrator, log on with the
 new administrator , then delete the first mal-named admnistrator.<br />
<br />
Alas, I found no delete option with the first user account.&nbsp; Then I supposed I had to do a system recovery to the factory default settings.&nbsp; Logging on to the second administrator wouldn't let me do it.&nbsp; So I had to log on as the first administrator.&nbsp; So there
 must be a big difference between them though both from the users' point of view are administrators.&nbsp; I suppose the first one is super administrator.<br />
<br />
So does Windows 8 still have a hidden default administrator like what Windows XP has?&nbsp; I am not too sure if Windows Vista or Windows 7 has the hidden default administrator where one can only access through safety mode.<br />
<br />
I would like someone to affirm or negate what I have found about the administrator.&nbsp; If I've missed anything, please let me know.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, i would suggest you to Enable Built Admin account.<br />
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together on your desktop screen.<br />
b) Click on Command Prompt (admin).<br />
c) Type: <strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong></div>
<div>Note: Please follow the same steps and type <strong>net user administrator /active: no</strong> to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done</div>
<div>After enabling Built-in admin, please try with the steps below:<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b>&nbsp; <span>I would have you perform the steps to delete the user account.</span>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Login to your default account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Start” and type “User Accounts”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, select “Settings” and then select the “User Accounts” icon.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Manage another account” and then select the user account that you want to delete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “delete the account”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Depending on whether you want to “Keep the files” or “delete the files” choose the appropriate option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You can delete the other accounts similarly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Once deleted, the user accounts cannot be recovered. Make sure you back up any data if required.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
Post us the results once you try the above steps.<br />

<h2>            Ok, so I&#96;ll ask here... Does anyone have any idea why I cannot get iCloud for windows to run on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have iCloud for windows on my Windows 8.! desktop, and it downloaded flawlessly, and is fabulous. I cannot get it to run on Windows 10. The program can be downloaded, and saved in downloads. hitting Run will result in this message(attachment). I am currently
 in various chats with an awesome Apple tech, and we have tried everything we can think of. The program never shows up in programs and features, nor in the list of programs in the install/uninstall trouble shooting pack, so a repair attempt is not possible.
 It just vanishes after I tap run, and OK in the installer error message. I`ve also tried disabling Windows defender to see if that was blocking it. There is no third party antivirus on this laptop at this time either .According to my tech, this is a MS issue,
 as it downloads from Apple just fine as a download, but MS installer isn`t having any of it! I`m not a fan of Windows 10 to begin with, and this isn`t helping! Any suggestions would be awesome. Also, I`ve worked my butt off to weed Chromium out of my system,
 as I hated it. There wouldn`t be any side effects from that would there? Chrome, and all it`s permutations tend to bog things down for me....Do not want them. I run it on my old Vista laptop because...Vista, as in no support, so I needed Chrome to run YouTube
 properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; iCloud is easily accessed via the net, but I really do want the full functionality of the download. Any ideas out there? If nothing else you hardcore MS fanboys have the entertaining thought that this does indeed have a bunch of Apple techs sweating
 and itching over this...…..It really does.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f09d8c8-0bb1-4473-a944-c9b1864560ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f09d8c8-0bb1-4473-a944-c9b1864560ee?upload=true" /></a>

<p>I installed iCloud on my copy of Windows 10 during my fling with the iPad. I didn't have any trouble installing it, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the installer that you downloaded and download the installer again. Sometimes software gets messed up as it travels through the internet to your computer. (Make sure you've got the right installer and that you get it directly from Apple.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it's helpful to install software while actually signed in to an Administrators account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, my experience with Apple's software (iTunes, iCloud) is similar to my experience with Microsoft's software: installs fine, works well, no problems, but the company behind the software sucks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chromium and Chrome are not the same things. You might as well get used to Chrome because Microsoft is re-doing Microsoft Edge to give it the same rendering engine as Chrome.</p>

<p>Are you sure the downloaded exe file is complete? I just downloaded it, and it should be</p>
<p>Size: 162139960 bytes (154 MiB)</p>
<p>SHA1: 116D4AF17F5E89C85F5A5FA2D0E5BAF2E0204E7B</p>
<div><br />
<p>The reason you see that error, from what i understand, is as follows. The downloaded exe is a self-extractable archive. But somehow it did not succeed in extracting the msi file. So when the msi installer cannot find it, it throws that error message. You
 can open the following location is examine the extracted files (version number may be different):</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Apple\Installer Cache\iCloud Control Panel 7.11.0.19</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may use 7zip/winzip/whatever tools to extract the exe file and examine its content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also be because the msi installer does not have enough permission/privilege to install it.&nbsp;</p>

            I noticed my Windows installer is stopped...I restarted it, but cannot set it to automatic (it is greyed out), this was discussed in a search on this topic I dId. HOWEVER, out of curiosity, I checked this on my other 2 PCs and both were exactly the same,
 settings wise. So, what else could it be. I know this is a MS, or less likely a PC issue, as iCloud loaded easily on the other 2 computers(windows 8.1and Vista). Really annoying....

            Yes. I have uninstalled and installed at least 8 times.... Several of these with Apple watching via remote view access, and guiding me ( verbally, no one touched my controls). Icloud never loads into the C:/ files, any where.It just seems to vanish into
 the void. I’ve been all over my files, and it appears nowhere. &nbsp;

            Yes, I know those are separate things, and i hate them both..... Chromium blocked half of what I was trying to do. I ended up removing it from the registry, and don’t want it back.... Google may be the future, but remember it is pretty much what killed
 the Windows phone.... Fling with the iPad? Seriously! That’s my preferred platform, best device I’ve ever had. Using it to post here. As for companies behind software sucking, I’m discovering that as far as customer support, that is true only of MS at this
 point. They should at LEAST have an actual human on live chat. Sorry, but I love the fact I can call Apple, and get a real, live, US based person that actually answers questions. I honestly don’t mind that MS has foreign call centers, but I do mind when they
 refuse to listen and immediately launch into “connecting me to a paid tech”. I can generally figure stuff out if I have someone to troubleshoot with.The fact that these people sound exactly like the MS scam callers doesn’t h

            If you have a wireless keyboard and mouse, try unplugging the transceiver and using a corded keyboard/mouse while running the update. (We saw the problem occur specifically with Logitech wireless keyboards/mice, but haven't tested with other brands.)

            <p>Santosh&nbsp; :</p>
<p>Detail #1&nbsp; : No blue screen after updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; All went well and the screen presented my desktop afterward . (I checked the update file and found two updates on 31 July. KB3074686 and KB3074678 . Don't know what they updated but maybe that will help you )</p>
<p>Found another update : KB3081444&nbsp; Undated but I think it's the one that caused the problem .</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Detail #2 : The shut down option is missing from the windows icon in the bottom left of the screen. It used to (when left clicked on ) present three or four options, one of which was shut down. Now, the only way I found to shut down is to right click on
 the same icon. I get a drop down with 10-12 options , one of which is shut down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detail #3 : My Computer is a Dell Inspiron 660S that was, before updating to win10, running win 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for you suggestions, The System File Checker is waaay above my talent !&nbsp; </p>

            <p>OK, To make this more easy to understand, It concerns the Windows Icon in the bottom left of the screen :</p>
<p>When first installed, Jul 31/15, I could left click on the icon and a pop up window appeared. This window had numerous items in it . I remember Candy Crush and being able to shut down the computer.</p>
<p>Now, after unknown updates, I no longer get that pop up window to go to games and candy crush nor shut down the computer !</p>
<p>By chance, I right clicked on the icon and got another pop up window which enabled me to shut down the computer.</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, It now takes much longer to load my programs than it did before. as much as 30 to 45 seconds.&nbsp; Seems like maybe this Windows 10 might not be as good (for my computer) as it was touted to&nbsp;be ?? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I finally got into the System File checker and did the check. The results said it found corrupted files and corrected the problem it found . I tried to see , using the prompts on the file checker page and could not see the problem nor corrective actions
 . </p>
<p>&nbsp;I right click on the windows icon and still get a small white popup with about ten actions on it . Before, I got a large popup window with games and other items on it&nbsp; .</p>
<p>The File checker did not fix my problem !!!&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT IS NEXT ? Do I call and let you remotely fix the problem ? Please ADVISE !

<p>The ONLY People that handle suspensions do NOT use these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to sign into your account at enforcement.xbox.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the orange hammer on the main page this will bring up your enforcement history and if the suspension is eligible you would be able to file for a case review.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will allow you to appeal the suspension which the enforcement team will then reinvestigate the report and determine if they can lift the suspension sooner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they decide to uphold the suspension then that is the final decision and you would have to wait out the suspension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind in the future in situations like this it is best to just block the person and mute them this will prevent you from being joined with them in future matchmaking games and would prevent them from being able to send messages to you as long as you
 do not send a message to them once you mute them.<br />

<p>Hiya Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the situation, but the Xbox live code of conduct is there to create an environment that is friendly for everyone! Xbox is a very family oriented company! There are many children who play Xbox as well and the code of conduct is set in
 place to encourage good sportsmanship and positive communication! (<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Code of Conduct</span></a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The enforcement team relies on other members to submit reports when another player breaks the Code of Conduct. Whoever "starts" it does not matter. Since you broke the terms and were reported, you received the suspension.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend just reporting the other player if this happens again, instead of trying to retaliate with your own messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-us">

<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Not Working</h2>
                    <p>So my account, Da Shrood, is having trouble with its xbox live gold. It is a preview program account and I recently subscribed my card for purchasing my gold. Currently, I cannot use my xbox live gold even though the purchase for it has gone through. What it shows under subscriptions in my settings is that it is subscribed, but I cannot do any xbox live gold activities like starting a party chat. I have tried both removing then readding my account and factory resetting my xbox and neither worked.&nbsp;I would just like to find a solution to my problem.</p>

            <p>My gold subscription was updated today 10/07/17 however i can no longer access any gold features, when i check my account i am clearly subscribed. I have raised this in online support chat only to put through various trouble shooting procedures such as restarting my console, deleting my profile and performing a factory reset. As i had expected none of this worked and i was basically told there was nothing they could do. After attempting to start a new chat i was informed i could not do so for a further month as i updated my details (excellent feature btw). I then phoned xbox support, was on the phone for half an hour and again no progress was made on my problem, instead i was directed to these forums. The customer "service"&nbsp;adviser believes the problem lies with the my account being part of the xbox insider preview program and advised that i raise my concerns here. I would very much like to get this problem resolved as i am paying for a service i am not receiving.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup can&#39;t find file &#40;error 0x80070002&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm getting this error every time I do a backup.</p>
<p>Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\My<br />
Scans. Error:(The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002))</p>
<p>By inspecting the system folder "\systemprofile\" it doesn't look like that it is a place for that type of folder/files</p>
<p>I do have a folder named My Scans located on my User folder. next to My pictures, My music, My documents and My videos, This folder is connected to the pictures library.</p>
<p>Apparently it backs up everyfile except for that folder and all it's files.</p>
<p>How do I fix whatever it's missing?</p>

            I found the answer, I hope is useful fopr people with the same problem.<br />
<br />
I just moved My Scans folder inside My Pictures folders and the backup went perfect.<br />
<br />
However I still&nbsp;have a&nbsp;question, If My Scans was included in My pictures library Why it didn't backup? Isn't&nbsp;supposed to backup all the files in the library regardless of the physical locations of the Folders or Files?<br />

            Copy your data files (music, pictures, etc.) to an external hard drive and then delete them from the C: drive. Uninstall programs you don't need. Use
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a> to remove temporary files. Note: use only the cleaning portion of CCleaner; stay away from the other tools! How big is your hard drive? Perhaps you should purchase a larger one.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken my Surface Pro (2017) into work recently, and it has a habit of connecting to any unsecured connection in range. I have never connected to these signals on this device, and I don't have any plans to connect to these unsecured WiFi connections.
 However, it will always connect when not connected to another WiFi, and I have to manually disconnect from any of them to connect to my personal Hotspot on my phone. I have confirmed that the "connect automatically" option is not selected on these unsecured
 networks. They do not show in my list of known networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some looking on Google for any help, but all I find are outdated pages, or its calling for an option that doesn't exist in my settings, such as WiFi Sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I have found that works is to block the network from showing in my WiFi list via a Command Prompt line of code that I found
<a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/block-wifi-network-windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I don't want to have to do this for every single WiFi connection that my device is trying to connect to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance to disable this "feature" would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            What edition of windows are you running?
<br />Is it professional, enterprise or education?
<br />If so try this gpo setting.
<br />Go to search and type gpedit.msc and open it.
<br />Go to Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\WLAN Service\WLAN Settings\Allow Windows to automatically connect to suggested open hotspots, to networks shared by contacts, and to hotspots offering paid services and set that setting to disabled.

<p>My surface is currently using Win 10 Pro version 1803(I made sure it was up to date on all updates as of a few minutes ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you suggested, going into gpedit.msc, and changed the setting to disabled, but it still connected to the unsecured WiFi. I even tried restarting, confirming the setting was still there, and within about 10 minutes it connected to the unsecured
 network again.</p>

            That should have worked.
<br />The only other suggestion I have for you is to reset your PC.
<br />Seems drastic but I have a surface pro 4 and about a month ago I could not connect to any wifi connections at all it would see them but couldn't connect.  I tried everything and after a reset it fixed it.
<br />I did the reset and keep files. So yes I had to install all my apps again.

<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.

<br />Click Reset to begin

<h2>            TWINUI &#40;default&#41; when I choose to download my photos from internet</h2>
                    <p>After all of the recent updates I cannot download my pics from Google photos (or any other from the internet for that matter). The "Open With" drop down menu shows&nbsp;TWINUI (default) with the option for a few other programs and Browse, as well as "Save File".
 I have checked the default apps and for Photo Viewer it was blank so I changed it to Photos. This did not fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose "Save File", the photo is "saved" in downloads automatically or wherever I choose. However, I don't want to all downloads to be saved in my User's picture folder, just pics/vids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs on any browser (not that that is the problem, but just threw that in for info)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only application that has this problem is Photos. I can select a correct program to open other file types with in the drop down menu.</p>

            I recall that when I tried to install the driver, that there was a message that said that it says that it is not supported.&nbsp; I am not sure if I re-installed the old operating system and then the new driver and then vista or if there was a button to install
 the driver even if it was not supported.&nbsp; Most likely, I installed the driver on the old operating system XP and then applied the Vista upgrade. I always run a clean install to clean out any spyware etc. The driver supports the Direct X9 which is what is required.
 The Vista used the driver that was already installed.&nbsp; I plan to upgrade to windows 7 in January and will post the results.

My Issue: Computer unexpected shutdown most likely to happen when playing intense graphics or sometimes infrequent, unexpected- is is windows software error, video card error or processor error or other errors? I am thinking is it due to my video card error?
 as i can't update my video card too, should i send it for a warranty repair?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for helping me out.<br />
