<h2>            Notification tone with no notifications</h2>
                    I've had Windows 10 since the OTA update. Today I've been getting a constant notification tone (like the one when my battery is low) but no notification or reason that I can find. I've updated everything I can think of, including the windows updates, and
 restarted the laptop multiple times. None of these things has stopped the notification tone. So far it has been happening every few minutes. &nbsp;Am I missing something? Is this an internal issue that will have to be fixed in a future update?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your PC?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any changes to the PC prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>When are you getting the tone, is it at the start up of the PC or when you are working on PC?</span></li><li><span>Which build are you using in Windows 10?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Let's try the below steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span>Check if the issue resolves in
<strong><span>Safe Mode.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Refer this article to boot to <strong>safe mode</strong>: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue resolves then perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot
</span></strong><span>and check.</span></span><strong><br />
</strong><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>

            <p>I also get confused when my computer makes a sound with no window to tell me what the sound is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose this I go to the Sounds tab in Control Panel &gt; Sound and play the individual sounds until I hear a match. That gives me at least a clue about what the general nature of the sound is. Then I visit Event Viewer and look for recent Errors or Warnings
 that might shed some light on what the sound was trying to tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I just have to be lucky to match the sound with something I was doing on the computer at the time. Usually it's just some silly notification that doesn't even matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside: It's worse when this happens on my phone. There's nowhere to go to look up what a sound means. All I can do is guess. One time I guessed wrong and soon after my battery died. That's one sound I won't forget.</p>

                    <p>We received a new Chatpad + headset for a gift, but the chatpad will not fit into the controller.</p>
<p>The XBox is XBox One S (white controller)</p>
<p>The Chatpad + Headset are labeled for XBox One / Windows 10 and are black.</p>
<p>Is it supposed to slide in easily?&nbsp; It certainly doesn't and without putting too much pressure does not seem to want to fit into the controller.&nbsp; We have already plugged the headset in directly to the controller and ran the firmware update.&nbsp; However, the chatpad simply won't fit into the controller.<br />

                    Hi I am using Sapphire Radeon HD 4890 VAPOR-X 2GB in my system and I am having some trouble. I was advised by ATI to come here. I use a custom ICC profile with WinColor and it works but and here is my problem...when I am playing a game(s) the color profile
 wont work. It always did on my machine when I was using Nvidia based cards so why wont it work with the ATI cards? Does anyone know how I can get it to work when I am gaming? I have Catalyst 9.9. My detailed system specs are: OS Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition

<h2>            Does the Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro work with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    On Microsoft's Support page, it lists the Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro as compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; However, "Help and Support" says that Windows 7 only supports USB game controllers.&nbsp; The Support page says all it needs is a free software download but
 links to no downloads for the joystick.&nbsp; Windows 7 is supporting my Creative Game Port under Device Manager, so that isn't a problem like it has been in the past.&nbsp; However, there are apparently just not any drivers that are available.&nbsp; I even tried downloading
 Win 95 &amp; 98 drivers and using them in Compatibility Mode and it would not recognize a game port when trying to install (while also trying to install DirectX 5.3).&nbsp; Is there anything I can do?&nbsp; Can I even get a Game Port to USB adapter to get it to work?

    <title>how to remove a custom hotkey&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farigiovanni  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to remove a custom hotkey&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, a few months ago I set the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+alt+shift" to the run... application, but now I wanna remove it because I have conflict with another programm hotkey. Here is my problem, I'm unable to remove that hotkey, I tryed to right click the
 run and go to properties&lt;shortcut but there is not hotkey assigned. I tryed also to go in packard bell folder and open an hotkey application but even there no signs of any custom hotkey and watching the interface I'm sure I never used the packard hotkey application.
 I'm wonder if there is any chance to get rid of it finding the origin of that customisation or resetting the win hotkey?<br />
<br />

                    <p>The volume pop up was actually useful when it was small and disappeared after just a couple of seconds but now its much larger with unnecessary skip and play buttons AND stays up longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do reduce the size and/or time displayed or just get rid of it completely?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>this is not to scale. its actually half the size shown but still no less annoying</p>

                    The laptop was bought with windows 8.1 on board, updated to 10 and now I want to make a downgrade.<br />
Reset to factory settings does not work, it gives an error, the same as the utility for creating an image of Windows, although the parameters I'm setting seem to be correct

            Hi Charles,  you can reinstall Windows 8.1 at any time, you will not need a product key and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 8.1 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 8.1 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 8.1 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 8.1 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 8.1 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Serenity.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What were you doing or trying to do when this popped up?
<br />
<br />The only reason not to clear TPM is if you have encrypted files stored on the PC or Product Keys that aren't recorded elsewhere:    <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/need-help-on-whether-to-clear-tpm-on-not.218795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/need...</a>
<br />
<br />So you cannot choose either option due to keyboard not working?  See if you need to press Fn key in additon to F2 to get past it.  
<br />
<br />If not what happens when you restart?  Can you interrupt it with the BIOS setup key: <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a> 
<br />
<br />If so enter BIOS setup and reset to defaults, save and exit. 
<br />
<br />If not you'll need to reset the CMOS to clear the message:  <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  Serenity,
<br />
<br />Either restart your PC or plug in another US keyboard . . .
<br />
<br />On that screen, choose No . . .
<br />
<br />If you are using Bitlocker, then you do not want to clear that key, if you are not using Bitlocker, then is does not matter . . .

<h2>            Nothing showing in &#34;My Computer&#34;</h2>
                    I've had Windows 7 Pro x64 installed for a few days now.&nbsp; When I view My Computer there are no drives shown.&nbsp; I have three hard drives and a DVD drive installed that were showing until .....<br />
<br />
I wanted to hide one of my hard drives.&nbsp; I went to the Computer Management window.&nbsp; Clicked on "Disk Management".&nbsp; Then I right clicked the F: drive, which is the one I wanted to hide.&nbsp; I clicked on "Change Drive Letter and Paths".&nbsp;&nbsp;On the popup window I clicked
 "Remove".&nbsp; Another popup asked me if I was sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I clicked "Yes".&nbsp; Then another popup warned me that continuing may cause programs to longer run.&nbsp; That's when I decided that maybe I shouldn't do it.&nbsp; I clicked "No".&nbsp; Everything seemed fine at that point,
 but when I opened My Computer it was empty.<br />
<br />
I don't know if any of this caused the problem, but the last time I looked at&nbsp;My Computer, which was&nbsp;yesterday, everything was there.<br />
<br />
I can view the contents of each drive by typing the drive letter into the text field in My Computer.&nbsp; But the drives themselves don't show when I firts open My Computer.

            Hi <strong>toddmike,</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
I suspect that accidentally you have removed the drive path letters.<br />
<br />
To change, add a drive letter<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management. Administrator permission required If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click Disk Management.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the drive that you want to change, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To assign a drive letter if one has not already been assigned, click Add, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change a drive letter, click Change, click Assign the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Ankit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check if resetting the password helps you to recover the affected Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do so, you need to&nbsp;sign in to your Microsoft account online. Follow the&nbsp;below simple steps and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you can still sign in to your Microsoft account, you should change your password immediately. This will prevent anyone who knows your password from accessing the account. On the
<span>Security &amp; privacy</span> page, tap or click <span>Change password</span>, then follow the instructions.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you can’t sign in to your account, your password may have been changed. Tap or click
<span>Can’t access your account?</span> Select <span>I think someone else is using my Microsoft account</span>, tap or click
<span>Next</span>, and follow the instructions. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10, the biggest POS OS ever&#63;</h2>
                    I am regretting upgrading to WINDOWS 10. &nbsp;If you have the choice, DON'T! &nbsp;Two to four hour updates with no ability to stop it from happening. &nbsp;At first it gives you the option to restart later, without giving you a time limit. &nbsp;Then it hijacks your computer
 when it decides to take it. &nbsp;Hopefully you are not in the middle of legal matters or tests for on-line classes that are timed. You will fail! &nbsp;Know this first hand. &nbsp;Thank you Microsoft! &nbsp;Mail does not have the option to "check all" so you have to delete each
 and every e-mail multiple times. &nbsp;I will never opt into a free upgrade for Windows again. &nbsp;This is the worst Windows version ever, in my opinion.

            It's been truly a nightmare for me.&nbsp; I purchased a Lenovo Z50, 8G, 1T HDM on March 8, 2016.&nbsp; I've had the BSOD episodes AT LEAST once every 24 hours, since purchase.&nbsp; I cannot believe that Bill Gates would allow a horrible product like this to come out
 on the market.&nbsp; First of all let me say;&nbsp; I've owned Windows OS since 1995.&nbsp; I've had the following OS:&nbsp; 97, 2000, XP, 7 HP and now this piece of garbage.&nbsp; It is unfathomable to me that MS has done this and furthermore has a blaze attitude about free assistance.&nbsp;
 i was told by and Answer Tech that the problem could be fixed for $149 by a Pro Tech.&nbsp; ****?&nbsp; Why didn't they fix this issue before release?&nbsp; Shareholder driven product if you ask me.&nbsp; I've been told:&nbsp; "you're using old drivers that cause it to happen."&nbsp; Well
 then why doesn't it go BSOD EVERY time?&nbsp; I use all the same drivers EVERY time.&nbsp; I use the same apps EVERY time.&nbsp; So that's just a BS answer.&

<h2>            Microsoft doesn&#39;t care about us.</h2>
                    <p>I just want to share my experience with Microsoft in hopes of preventing another person to go through what I've went through dealing with these moneygrubbers. All I was trying to do was set up an Xbox live account for my nephew and buy him a game. It took 5 hours to set up an account for him because of all of the security hoops I had to jump through. I'm not exaggerating. I had to verify my identity multiple times, basically every time I provided new information, I was made to verify that I was indeed who I said I was. This meant having to enter my email address multiple times, receive multiple security codes which I had to then enter on the website.

You receive a "0x80070490" error code when you use Windows Update or Microsoft Update Web sites to install updates<br />
<br />
Method 1: run the System Update Readiness tool (Checksur.exe)
<ol>
<li>Download and run the System Update Readiness tool. This tool runs a one-time scan for inconsistencies that may prevent future servicing operations. For more informationabout how to download and run the Checksur.exe tool, click the following article number
 to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<div><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/kb/947821/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">947821</a>&nbsp; <span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/ )
</span>Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows Server 2008 R2</div>
</li><li>Try to install updates again. </li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong> After you run the tool, the Checksur.log file is saved in the following location: %systemroot%\Logs\CBS
<br />
<br />
In a default installation of Windows, %systemroot% represents the Windows directory.
<br />
<br />
If this method does not resolve the issue, go to Method 2.
Method 2: perform a repair installation of Windows
If method 1 does not resolve this issue, you must perform a repair installation of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Performing a repair installation will restore the current Windows installation to the version of the
 installation DVD. This also requires the installation of all updates that are not included on the installation DVD.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
To perform a repair installation of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Close all applications, and then restart the computer. </li><li>Insert the Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</li><li>In the Setup window, click <strong>Install Now</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:

, and then type <span>&lt;var&gt;Drive&lt;/var&gt;:\setup.exe</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> The &lt;var&gt;Drive&lt;/var&gt; placeholder is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.

</li><li>Click <strong>Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended)</strong>.
</li><li>Type the CD key if you are prompted to do this. </li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms. </li><li>On the <strong>Which kind of installation do you want?</strong> screen, click

<h2>            Made Xbox Live avatar for my wife, want screen shot</h2>
                    
<p>I would think this would be a simple task, but I've been having no luck so far.... &nbsp;
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>
<p>I have an (individual) Xbox Gold account for my gamertag and an avatar for it. &nbsp; I also created a tag &amp; avatar (on my console) for my wife, so we can play head-to-head (local) games. &nbsp; Truthfully, we don't do that often - she's not a big gamer.</p>
<p>However, the avatar looks <i>uncannily</i> like her - much moreso than my own looks like me - and I'd like to get an image of it that she could use on her laptop as an avatar for other venues.</p>
<p>Yet I can't figure out how I can get her avatar to display on this site (which would then make possible a screen capture). &nbsp; I can display &amp; edit my OWN avatar on the website, but the site seems not to know that HER avatar exists. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>She doesn't need Live gaming capability or anything else - I just want a couple screen-caps of her avatar.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-43.gif" /></p>

<p>The best way for you to do this is to make a Live Silver account. Her avatar does not show up on the website because to microsoft, it does not exist. The simplest way to do it is to select the local account and select upgrade account. it will ask you to
 enter a Windows Live ID and Password and she will have a simple gamertag like ShinyPinapple2. Then sign in on the website and screencap the avatar</p>

<p>Set that account up on xbox live which should give 30 days free gold status.&nbsp; You could then try adding her as a friend on your gold account. &nbsp;Then you should be able to log into Xboxlive via the internet, click on your account and review your friends. &nbsp;Click
 on her GT and use Alt+Print Screen to get a screen grab.</p>

<p>Hiya BeadyEl - You will need to go to her offline profile, push the middle button on your XBOX 360 controller and go to "Join XBOX Live", follow the steps on her account to make her an XBOX Live Free member, once that's done her achievements and all that
 will be tracked online (even if you don't need it) this will then make that profile available to view online. It will give her a randomly generated gamertag on the website which you can change once for free within 30 days of the account being created by following
 the directions listed <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-xbox-live-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Disregard the add Microsoft points notice in the link as it's free for new accounts to change their
 gamertag once within the first 30 days of the account creation :).<br />
<br />
Once the profile is synced online (which is instantly after you've completed the signup process for XBOX Live Free) you can then go to the edit avatar section and screencap whatever you'd like for your wife.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lord of the Rings &#58; Battle for Middle Earth 2 backwards compatible.</h2>
                    <p>So as you may know LOTR BFME 2 is not for sale anywhere. steam GGO. EA. etc is not for sale. and EA has been pretty dumb about their games. So I doubt they would do something smart like bringing back BFME 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought "I used to play it on xbox 360" So hopefully if I vote for it. it can get noticed and reinstated... Well "Thank YOU" microsoft for taking the voting out of your feedback. actually scratch that. for reworking your feedback system. (they only
 want to hear feedback for stuff they want to hear.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyways. so I thought the next best thing is to get it on a discussion page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's funny cause even though EA doesn't sell BFME 2 I saw a guy who had an old activation code. he sent it in to their support. and they sent him a digital code for the DIGITAL version of BFME 2. (unfortunately they gave him "Rise of the Witch-KIng" expansion.
 so is kinda worthless without the base-game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I love this game. I remember building fortresses all through the map. trying to crush my enemies with just buildings. (and occasionally sending in fellbeasts to destroy artillery. :P )</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I really hope that Lord of the Rings : Battle for Middle Earth 2 comes to xbox one as a backwards compatible game. ^_^</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. (I have found big communities on steam and GGO that wanted a revival of it. But they have yet to be heard from.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't gone to WB (Warner Bros) yet cause I think EA still holds the rights to the game.</p>

            I got the game on 369 and would love it to be backwards compatible. It would be better if they remade the original and/or made a new one completley like halo war but lord of the rings, but i would be happy with a backwards compatibility.

<h3> greg in texas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Status in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I use the "Local Area Connection Status" to keep up with the volume of usage on my Exede Satellite connection. &nbsp;I am limited to 10 GByte per month so I have to be mindful of how much I am using.</p>
<p>In Windows 7, every time I rebooted or started up in the morning the Sent/Receive line would start off a 0/0 Bytes.</p>
<p>Since moving to Windows 10, each morning it seems to still show what I left off with from the previous day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to clear the previous days usage so I start out at 0 bytes each morning? &nbsp;Seems something has changed in the new version of Windows. &nbsp;Can't find anything on this site or the web that would address this problem.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>That will depend on the Caller ID that you will setup on your account. If you don't have one, the name that will be displayed when you call a mobile/landline number would either be "Private Number" or "Restricted Number". You can&nbsp;change it by using either
 a Skype Number or your own Mobile number to appear when you are calling. Here is an FAQ for more information about this:

<h3> realgwoodard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Event IDs 14 &#38; 11 --a hardware problem or something else&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;regularly (twice a week or more) get&nbsp;&nbsp;event ID 14 &nbsp; (IO failure on volume C:) &amp; event ID 11 ("The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Harddisk0\DR0.") on my laptop. &nbsp;Usually the system freezes while playing a video, forcing a reset, and the last
 errors in the log are: one (1) event 14, followed by several dozen event 11s. &nbsp;However the bios disk checker<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">never finds any actual read errors.</span>&nbsp;The laptop is an HP DV7, with my own separate copy of Win7 Pro post-installed.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &nbsp;Is this an actual indication of a drive failure<strong>or</strong> something else that would not resolve by replacing the drive?</p>
<p>The Seagate st9500420as drive is only $69 which is cheap, but restoring the OS (Windows 7 Pro in this case) is not, it's a hassle &nbsp;--At least with XP it was. I've never been able to restore the OS without first doing a clean install (Which is redundant),
 and the restore&nbsp;<strong>always</strong> forgot its activation status, which means the backup was somehow flawed. &nbsp;<strong>Question 2</strong>: is this any easier in Windows 7?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you playing the video saved in hard disk or from an external device?</span></p>
<p><span>Event ID 11 could be a result of a bad or corrupted device driver, a hardware problem, a malfunctioning device, poor cabling, or termination issues.
 This is an error occurring within the driver or hardware itself, not the cluster software.</span></p>
<p><span>Event ID 14 is also a result of bad driver or a failing hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>When you make a significant hardware change to your computer, such as upgrading the hard disk and memory at the same time, you might be required
 to activate <span>Windows</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span>Check&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Activating-Windows-7-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> for more information regarding
 activation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: I would suggest you to run a Check disc. This should also help for the backup and restore&nbsp;issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Run “chkdsk /f /r” to repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors from the Command prompt in
 System Recovery Options menu.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup of your files before running check disk.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, and the recovery info. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your question, it has <strong>only ever frozen on streaming videos,</strong> both Hulu and youtube. &nbsp;It has never frozen while playing a local file stored on the HD. Which to me suggests the hard drive surface where it likes to buffer the streams.
 &nbsp;But OTOH the bios checker finds no disk errors.</p>
<p>Update: the last freeze forced a chkdisk which found corrupted files, and made me nervous. &nbsp;When I first tried to skip the chkdisk, the boot was VERY slow, so I was forced to allow the chkdisk and cross my fingers.</p>
<p>Also the event IDs show up in the log every day or two even when there is no freeze.</p>
<p>My gut says its a hardware problem due to the randomness of the events, often when the machine is idle. &nbsp;But I'll reinstall the&nbsp;driver because thats the&nbsp;easiest&nbsp;to try first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This seems to be a hardware issue. If reinstalling the driver does not help, then I would suggest you to contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manufacturer of the computer</a> for more help.</p>
