            tell him to run a virus scan. <br />
<br />
Another thing you can do is type in an elevated command prompt "sfc /scannow"<br />

<p>Hey loon83,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Have you cleared your XBOX 360's System Cache? Instructions&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Have you checked your storage device for any sort of corrupted data?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please check by going to your XBOX 360 Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Hard Drive &gt; Games and Apps, take a look at files within those folders or anything Grand Theft Auto IV related and see if they have a yellow exclamation mark next to them (!) that
 will mean those files are corrupt and they need to be deleted. If they are there, delete them and try to login to XBOX Live via Grand Theft Auto IV and see if you are able to stay connected.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Opinion on Kinect.</h2>
                    
<p>I think the Kinect is a complete failure,It can only be used on only a few different types of genre's ;how would you actually do combos in a fighting game? I think that Microsoft will discontinue the Kinect in late 2013,after Ryse is released.</p>

<br />
The Kinect <em>games</em> are completely lacking. &nbsp;They are limited in their scope. &nbsp;They are very linear. &nbsp;They are not very good. &nbsp;That doesn't mean the Kinect hardware is a failure. &nbsp; I don't see them dumping the Kinect. &nbsp;Instead, Microsoft will probably
 change the Kinect's focus. &nbsp;They already are. &nbsp;Instead of Kinect only games, they will concentrate more on games that use Kinect to augment controller games (stuff like Forza 4, Ghost Recon: Future Solider, etc). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft will also move the focus of Kinect to PC applications. &nbsp;Like this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Ep3oqicVU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Ep3oqicVU</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/f5Ep3oqicVU?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/f5Ep3oqicVU?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><br />

<p>I have said this from the start but Kinect is the biggest joke ever created. I wouldn't play on that garbage if you paid me. I play games to relax not jump about like a complete moron having some sort of seizure.</p>
<p>Also I live in a pretty big house bit there is not one room in my house where I could use that garbage. At least with the Wiimote you could still use it whilst sitting on your bed or in a chair.</p>
<p>Someone really needed to tell those clowns that designed it that not all of us live in big open plan American style houses.</p>
<p>As for the games total shovelware of the first order. Heck they make the Wii games look good.</p>
<p>I would love to know just how many Kinects are still being used once the novelty wore off after 5 minutes and everyone reallsed just how garbage it really is.</p>
<p>Another reason why I hate that garbage is because MS has stopped making games for the 360 so they can concentrate on making games for that garbage.</p>
<p>If MS are not careful they are going to lose the hardcore &nbsp;gamers that made them.</p>
<p>Here is a perfectly true story. My sister who knows nothing about gaming wanted to try this motion control so she went and got her family a PS3 and MOVE as even she could tell that is Kinect looked like total garbage of the first order and didn't fancy jumping
 about like an idiot playing games.</p>

<p><span>Your opinion but that doesn't mean it 's the worst system. Kinect is a advanced system and made a major good sale.</span></p>

<p>I kind of grew tired of the games themselves, although Kinect Sports is a great game to play with friends over. &nbsp;I can definitely see them branch out and make the Kinect work with games, along with a controller. &nbsp;It's definitely not a failure, as we haven't
 seen all that it's capable of doing yet.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do also have to say, that people get a chubby for banging on this product.</p>

    <title>Is Format Local D Disk safe&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaiasgutierrez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Format Local D Disk safe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before let me give some details. Im no expert on this , they sent me this Used computer from USA since my laptop broke.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well since i was trying to get the new Windows 10 , i didnt get the "Get Windows 10" App and i followed some solutions online wich brought me look at my Local Disk D: , it says that i cant use it until i format. So i looked up that online , some people say
 you need to go to properties/tools/ and check for erros. But when i try to check for errors it tells me that i need to format before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is , should i format? Is it safe? </p>
<p>When i give format , it tells me it will format local Disk C instead of D</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont care about loosing personal data , since i still dont have important things. What im worried is that some crazy thing happen, like the computer wont go on again.&nbsp; When i choose "Format" it gives me it will format 233 GB wich corresponds to my local
 C: </p>
<p>When they sent me the computer , they just sent me that and the charger , so i dont have any Drive Cds or stuff like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing , the computer says Windows 7 on a sticker , but it seems they actualized it to Windows 8.1 does that have anything to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So should i format or leave it like that? My computer runs fine , although kind of slow but i just need it for homework. So what should i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me , please i will aprecciate. Im sorry if i have bad grammer , my english is no native.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why format D:?</p>
<p>You have to install the free windows 10 Upgrade to the existing and qualifying windows License which is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have nothing to upgrade from, you don't get the free upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can not do a clean install of 10 at first, or dual boot it on another partition, it is an upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Well i talked about the Windows 10 stuff because thats how i discovered the D: issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my old computer i could access D: with no problems , and in this one i cant. Because it saids "Unable to Access" and it tells me to format first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question basically is , should i give that importance? or just leave it like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or should i format? like the computer saids to regain access to that disk? </p>

            <p>Look in Disk Management as to its size and what it is.</p>
<p>D: can be the Recovery partition and be about 5-15GBs in size.</p>

            Did you receive any error for the update that was failed to install?
<br />
Are you trying to install the update through automatic updates? If yes, try downloading the update manually from the following link and then try installing it and verify the result.<br />

            Great. <br />
<br />
The important part for me is the 802400D error code.&nbsp; It's a new one to me, but when I looked into it, it seems that one cause is that the update did not download completely.&nbsp; That is what this article says: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-8024200d<br />
<br />
Go to the link and download the tool it suggests, and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, here is the site search I used. Read through the hits and try any suggestions that seem to make sense:<br />

Before jumping to a hotfix (I have no idea,yet, if one is there or even needed), first lets see if there is a problem on your computer that should be fixed.<br />
<br />
Go back into Windows update, "View Update History" and find the last failed attempt to install the update. Double click on it&nbsp; and find the "error detail:&nbsp; code ???????" . There may be a blue link beside it that may provide help.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If that isn't good enough try searching this site by putting "code #######" in the search window at the top of this page and click on the arrow beside the Search Button, select "All Forums". Read through the hit list and see if there is a similar situation
 that you can use the fix for.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, try using the same search term in google or bing.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, post the error code back here. <br />

            <p>Basicaly, when I tried to search in the Microsoft site, Google, and Bing sites, they were mainly talking about Windows Vista and Windows 7 with very little to do with Microsoft XP at all which only offered very little solutions if any at all, so see everything
 below that I have posted below this that states everything I get when I click on the Update itself and the Error Code and what all it's telling me to do at that point which is what I already went thru with very little luck at all if any. Anything else I can
 try?</p>

            It is not always possible to find fixes specific to our version. The thing to remember is that XP &gt; Vista &gt; Win 7&nbsp; represent a stream of development from XP. Therefore many things that work in XP, will continue to work in Vista and Win7 AND visa versa
 Yes the user interface may have changed to get to the command, but the underlying command often still remains the same.&nbsp; You do want to be careful when trying to apply a "cross version fix", but it can be done.
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't see any other specific fixes to suggest.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41; crashing - Toshiba Satellite A505 w&#47; tosSENotify.exe.mui</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>My Toshiba Satellite A505 came pre-installed with Win 7 (64).&nbsp; Almost from the beginning, I had some questions of reliability with Win7.</p>
<p>I have noticed lately that there seems to be 2 recurring issues.&nbsp; One is with my NVIDIA display drivers.&nbsp; That I can identify and try to resolve.</p>
<p>The second is that a program stops working:&nbsp; tosSENotify.exe.mui.&nbsp; Noting that the beginning is "tos" as in "Tos"hiba, I thought it might be a Toshiba problem.&nbsp; So I disabled all Toshiba notifications.</p>
<p>I also did a search (I think I told it to search hidden system folders, etc.) for any file with that name.&nbsp; Nada.</p>
<p>Now, Win is crashing almost hourly creating system dumps.</p>
<p>Any help to try and stop this will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <strong><span>Hi PapaMarkie,</span></strong>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>I suggest that you check Event Viewer entries to find the faulty module that could be causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking
 Event Viewer.‌ </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click an event log in the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Double-click an event to view the details of the event and let us know the faulty module that is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Access the below links to know more about Event Viewer:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</span></span></a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may put the computer in a clean boot state and check for both the issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program
 manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
</span></strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to hear back from you.</span></p>

<h3> jae soon kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary update - issues with host taskbar overlay when RDP to client</h2>
                    <p>I've got a "minor" but very inconvenient issue after applying the Windows 10 anniversary patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to upgrading, when i RDP into a remote server, my host's taskbar would disappear, allowing the client's taskbar to be accessible (note - i do not have any sort of auto hide set on my taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with the new anniversary update, when i RDP into a remote server, my host's taskbar is shown permanently, hiding the client's taskbar underneath it, stopping me from clicking anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the client's taskbar is underneath it as i can see some controls through the transparent screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the default behaviour (i.e. prior to Windows 10 anniversary) for the taskbar to work?</p>

<p><span>Bonsoir , voila l explication&nbsp; , en fait j ai mon xbox slim depuis plus de 4 ans et ce soir j etais trop content de rejouer a Dead Space que j avais commencé hier soir ! J avais beaucoup de jeux téléchargés dessus etc etc , j ai acheté cet hiver un
 dd de 320 go pour pouvoir mettre plus de jeux dessus et ce soir avant de jouer je me suis dit je vais mettre le nouveau disque dans la console , alors je met le 320 a la place du 250 et je branche le 250 avec mes données avec un adaptateur que j ai acheté
 récemment ! Je pensais qu au demarrage ca ferait comme avec le dd de l ancienne xbox blanche , que j aurais un message pour faire le transfert mais non !

J ai l icone qui apparait et le dash , je vais faire un tour dans parametre et je vois dans stockage que je n ai qu un lecteur avec icone clé usb , pensant qu il s agissait du dd interne j ai choisi FORMATER et c est la que j ai pris conscience que je formatais
 mon ancien dd mais c était trop *** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
J ai voulu le remettre dans la console mais que dalle , ca me demande de faire une mise a jour et ca me marque qu une erreur est survenue et je ne peux rien faire ! J ai tenté de mettre le dd de 320 et pareil !&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Du coup je suis coincé !<br />
<br />
AIDEZ MOI SVP <br />
<br />
Je pense que quand mon DD sera reconnu je pourrais en me connectant a mon gametag , récuperer certaines données , que l on peut voir sur notre compte internet xbox , non ?<br />
<br />
merci beaucoup d avance pour votre aide car j ai la haine , j ai perdu tout ce que j avais fait avec skyrim , fallout 3 etc .....
</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Quand je met aussi bien le disque dur de 250 go ou celui de 320 go , aucun n apparait dans ma xbox , ca me marque que je n ai aucun périphérique de stockage !<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Si je branche le dd de 250 go avec le cable sur mon pc il bip sans cesse comme s il avait un defaut et n apparait pas dans le poste de travail , si je branche le dd de 320 lui il apparait dans le poste de travail , la j ai lancé un formatage pour voir
 mais en ntfs ! Si j utilise le logiciel que j ai eu avec mon cable de transfert , ca s appelle xploder , je vois trois partitions dans mon dd de 320 mais il n y a rien dedans , alors que normalement il devrait y avoir des fichiers !<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>merci d avance pour votre aide !<br />

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>Malheureusement le mal est fait le disque de 250 Go ayant été formaté, de plus il n'est pas autorisé par les Conditions d'utilisation de modifier les fichiers d'un dd Xbox via un soft quelconque et ce sous peine de suspension définitive de la console.</p>

<p>Tu as tout dis Bombaa; enfin si on veux continuer á jouer en toute légalité ; de toute façon je pense qu'une autre façon serait impossible car ce genre de produit est justement étudié et conçu pour ne fonctionner tel quel. Mais je confirme donc ce que tu
 as dis. Microsoft est américain(pas japonais; donc leur produit ne se trafiquent pas)</p>

<p>Donc je pense que tu pourras essayer la nouvel X Box 360; ou mieux: la One. Car pour pouvoir de nouveau jouer normalement et en étant sur de ne pas te retrouver avec des problèmes de compatibilité, (disque dur, DLC, sauve garde et autre), tu devra donc t'acheter
 soit un nouveau disque dur dans un micromania ou un magasin concurant; ou encore mieux, tu contact le X Box Support en leur exposant ta situation( par contre lá si ta console n'est plus sous garantie, l'envoie de la console ainsi que la réparation sera á tes
 frais; mais lá ça sera bien fait, compte 2-3 mois et demi pour ça . Mon casque x Box One qui était encore sous garantie avait été envoyé en Allemagne pour réparation en usine á cause d'un défaut de fabrication, et la réparation fut entièrement payée par Microsoft
 envoie du casque, réparation et retour du casque.</p>
<p>Donc appelle le support X Box; en exposant bien ce qui c'est passé. </p>

<p>merci mais je n ai rien trafiqué , j ai l impression que vous croyez que je voulais pirater ma console , pas du tout , j ai commandé un disque dur de 320 go pour remplacer le dd de 250 go que j avais a l origine dans ma console car j avais une quarantaine
 de jeu et des dlc , j en ai acheté certains et eux les gratuits du xbox live , je suis abonné depuis plus de 3 ou 4 ans au live ! Bref j ai mis le dd de 320 dans la console et bizarrement la console ne détectait pas le dd , ce qui est vraiment bizarre , et
 j avais branché le dd d origine de 250 en externe contenant mes données , mais en allant dans la section stockage j ai betement je l avoue cliqué sur formater en pensant que j avais a faire au dd de 320 go , et maintenant ce qui m étonne c est que meme vide
 &nbsp;le dd de 250 go d origine , formaté en externe , n est lui non plus pas détecter dans la console !</p>
<p>J ai une autre 360 neuve toujours emballé (car eu en cadeau ) et je vais tenter la meme chose et a mon avis ca ne marchera pas !</p>
<p>A mon avis quand j ai formaté aussi bien le 320 que le 250 , je les ai formaté en externe comme une clé 32 go et maintenant que je les met dedans , comme ils sont de 32 go la console ne les détecte pas ! Les dd d origine doivent etre normalement , et si
 je ne me trompe pas , entierement formatés en fat 32 et il n y a que microsoft pour le faire car nous avec windows nous ne pouvons pas le faire !</p>
<p>Voila dites moi ce que vous en pensez , merci ! </p>
<p>Au pire hier a la hotline on m a dit de les recontacter et que je renverrais les dd par courrier avec le num de serie de ma derneire console qui elle est garantie !</p>
<p>merci </p>

<p>Je faisais référence au logiciel que tu as cité.</p>
<p>Concernant les DD internes le format utilisé est propriétaire à la console pour ces disques et effectivement, le formatage externe par la console en FAT32 rend ces disques "illisibles" lorsqu'ils sont reconnectés en interne.</p>

<p>ah ok Boombaa , ben ce logiciel était sur le cd que j ai eu avec le dd acheté chez amazon alors moi j y connais rien , je pensais que tout était legal comme un cd de driver !
</p>
<p>bref maintenant je vais renvoyer le dd de 250 a microsoft pour me le faire réparer , pour ce qui est de l autre qui ne doit pas etre officiel et moi je savais pas , ben soit je m en servirais de dd externe pour mon pc sinon je verrais !</p>
<p>De ce fait je pense me commander un dd officiel de 500 go , en espérant ne rien avoir a faire et simplement le coller dans la console et remettre mon gametag et compte en branle histoire de rétélécharger tous les jeux que j avais acheté !</p>

            That icon is your network icon. You do not say what kind of a network you are using. However I will give you an example. If you redo your network connection or are using a USB network stick and plug the stick in a different USB slot and create a new connection
 Windows will name each new connection 2 then 3 then 4 and so on. You can rename the connection to your liking. To rename the connection right click the network icon in the notification tray, click network and sharing center, click manage network connections,
 right click your network connection icon and click rename.

<h3> sonjahayes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Face-recognition not working after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP ENVY Notebook, and ever since Microsoft has done updates in late November and this week, several things have not been working properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My face recognition is not working at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Although my settings are set differently, after 5 minutes of inactivity, it asks for my password to get back into my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I cannot play the games I used to play online. It will not even open their apps. (I've reinstalled them, too.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I do teleconferences with my husband's ALS specialist. Monday, my camera was working for the test call. Yesterday, my computer did an update. Today, the camera wasn't working on my end for the teleconference so my husband's specialist could not even see
 him during "visit". This, above all else, cannot happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated because I have never had problems like these before with any of my laptops. I use my laptop for work (teacher) and for long distant communication with my husband's specialist. What can be done to correct this?</p>

<p>Hi Sonja,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Hello sign-in and face recognition concern is quite a known issue among many users and our system engineers are currently working with an update to resolve this. Initially, it is advisable to check if any updates are waiting for a pending
 restart. If so, please restart Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this won't result to a positive outcome, you are likely experiencing a known issue in
<strong>Fall Creators (1709) Update</strong> affecting a small number of devices. To check if this is your Windows version, type<strong> winver</strong> and select the first result. In the meantime, you can use your PIN or password to sign in. Once the fix
 is installed via Windows Update, face authentication should work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your camera issue, you may get errors in using the Camera app due to an outdated webcam driver or a third-party software blocking the app to start. In order to resolve this, we highly recommend following the procedures provided on this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-can-not-find-or-start-the-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Windows can't find or start the camera</strong></a>. This will walk you through the methods of rectifying errors that may happen when using or starting the Camera app in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

<p>Ah! Im dumb. I just realised the disc is for the pc and not the laptop. I dont think i have the laptop disc anymore tbh, and dont remember ever having it (im bad with storage of such things. im trying to improve that ofc) is there any way i can download
 the correct version online or something like that? Its a valid key just going to be tricky working out what version it was/is...</p>

 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />

<strong>Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />

    <title>Child Account Catch 22&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prymreq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child Account Catch 22&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My daughter has had an Xbox gamertag for many years, now she finally has a chance to join Xbox LIVE!&nbsp; However, being a child, they force you to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CREATE</span> a NEW account, so that they can charge the parent $.50.&nbsp; Now I cannot figure out how to migrate her original gamertag, gamerscore or achievements to this FORCED new account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no issues last year joining my son to Xbox Live... no PC only (new) account creation, just him redeeming the code (setting up an email) and me verifying my parent status.&nbsp; This new system is HORRIBLE... charging for a new child account then not being
 able to keep all their gaming history?</p>
<p>I've been a long time supporter of Xbox consoles and Xbox LIVE.&nbsp; Making it so confusing and difficult for long time child players to join LIVE is inexcusable!&nbsp; I think my family and everyone I know will be cautioned against your systems and your (crappy)
 services in the future, FAR too much work to get enjoyment from something SO expensive.&nbsp; I am VERY upset!</p>
<p>I would appreciate a prompt remedy.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I don't really play games on Xbox too often, only when I'm fooling around with my kids. They finally bugged me enough to let them join Xbox Live so they can play games with their friends. After trying to join Live via the Xbox
 console, the kids got the message explaining a parent had to create the account on the website. I followed all the steps, confirmed that I was the parent, and I paid the 50¢ to verify I was a real adult. The problem now is that I can't find a way to connect
 the child account on the Xbox console to the new Live/Xbox account that I was just forced to create. I've been looking for hours, reading forum posts, and searching the Xbox support website. But, there really isn't any clear info on how to do this. Obviously,
 I'm not the only person with this problem, and I think it's ridiculous that there isn't a clear, simple, concise explanation or set of instructions regarding this issue on the Xbox 360 FAQ page or support site or whatever. I don't want to tell my kids they
 have to start all over from scratch and lose the history, achievements, awards, etc that they've built up. That would be a nightmare, and honestly it's just plain ridiculous if that's really the only option. Do you have a teenager in your house? Can you imagine
 the disaster tornado that could come from telling a hormonal teenager that everything they've achieved over the years must be forgone if they want to play online with friends? There has to be another way. I refuse to believe that a concept as simple as connecting
 a previously offline Xbox profile with a newly created Xbox.com account is impossible. It can't be impossible. It should be a simple 1-2-3 step process (the first 2 of which I've already completed!). Please, can someone who knows the real deal here help me
 get my kid's offline Xbox profile connected to the new child account that I was instructed to create (and pay 50¢ for).</p>

<p>Does the new child Live account have its own Gamertag? &nbsp;If not, then I think you should be able to use the email and password associated with that when upgrading the offline profile on the console. &nbsp;When it gets to the point where you're entering an email
 you want to use, try using the child email you set up online. &nbsp;From what I recall of the account creation process, it should link the profile to the Live account at that point.<br />
<br />
If you created the profile through xbox.com, and it gave the child account a random Gamertag already, you'll likely not be able to use that Live account unless you move that Gamertag off of it, which can take 30 days.&nbsp; It may be simpler to start over and create
 a new Live profile, although this would mean having to re-authorize as a parent, which would cost another $0.50.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong, and you created a Live account for a child, and it has no Gamertag, and the console still isn't letting you associate it, could you post what the console says when you try?&nbsp; I'm curious to see if this part of the process has changed.</p>

<p>Proceeding as per the online help guide, my daughter signs in with her currently played profile. &nbsp;Then goes to Join Xbox LIVE. &nbsp;After filling in info, using the newly "purchased" email and password, it says "This account already exists on another device,
 would you like to sign into another account?" &nbsp;The ONLY option then is OK. &nbsp;NO, this is NOT OKAY!</p>
<p>PS: Xbox did automatically assign her new profile a random gamer tag.</p>

<p><span>The problem here is that you may have entered this e-mail into a different profile when setting up. Sometimes this will happen. You can try to make another MS account/Email to use. I have experienced this problem myself and
 I have felt the exact same way, so making a new email and placing it as her MS Account email attached to her gamertag should do the trick!</span></p>

<p>She DID not ever have an ONLINE account before. &nbsp;There was NO email associated with her gamertag. &nbsp;The console would not allow assigning an email to it because she was a child, it required me to go to a PC and create this new account/profile. &nbsp; So, YEAH,
 because I HAD to make this new profile her email is of course linked to it. &nbsp;That makes sense, but why couldn't this ALL be handled through the console... without EXTRA accounts (payed for) being created?

<p>I didn't WANT to create a new profile for her... it REQUIRED me to. &nbsp;The console would not allow her to join because she was a child. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now... because XBOX forced me to create and pay for an account I cannot use, and associate an email with it (hers) I have to set up an entire new email for her, a new profile, so Xbox gets paid..? &nbsp;WAIT... I fail so see how this helps correct anything
 about KEEPING her achievements and gamerscore.</p>

<p>Okay, i see your angle... still sucks she has to abandon her REAL email address (she is a child after all) and make up a new fictitious one JUST for this crummy service. &nbsp;Teaches children that multiple identities is the ONLY way to get things done.

<h2>            Microsoft wedge keyboard stops working randomly</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft wedge keyboard which stops working randomly. Then sometimes after a while it starts to work but some of the keys seem to jammed on even though they are physically not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it just stops working while im using it and then it also makes the laptop keyboard non responsive aswell and sometimes it affects the left and right clicking on the mouse. its like a key is stuck on the wedge keyboard so the mouse doesnt function properly
 e.g. it seems to have the shift key stuck so when I click something it makes a selection or opens new pages as if I was holding down shift and clicking</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the device and reconnected it</p>
<p>I have replaced the batteries for fresh ones</p>
<p>I have updated my bluetooth driver even though windows did not find any new updates for it</p>
<p>I have downloaded the microsoft mouse and keyboard center but it says no device found</p>
<p>It randomly worked and stopped working while typing this thread!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be a hardware fault?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an Acer 8943G on windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could someone help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that Wedge keyboard does not work properly. And I do appreciate your time and patience in trying to fix the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>It may occur due to hardware problems, missing or corrupted drivers, missing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the methods below and check.</p>
<p>Method 1</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
<p>Refer the link below which would help in fixing common Keyboard issues.</p>

            <p>Okay so further testing. My bluetooth speaker now also has decided to stop working correctly after awhile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine then all of a sudden it will start to stutter the sound. Or if I switch from one program to another e.g. playing songs on itunes then changing to play a video on youtube etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have to turn off the speaker and back on again and then the laptop connects to it and then it works fine...... until it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I cant seem to go back far enough on my system restore option to try to put the laptop back to before I started to have these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it surely sounds like there may be a problem with the bluetooth on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled all the bluetooth related drivers through device manager and restarted the computer for it to reinstall the drivers but still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Coincidentally today I had to re-pair my Surface RT and Surface Pro and had a ridiculously hard time doing it.&nbsp; One thing I decided from the experience:&nbsp; stay away from the MUF Bluetooth settings dialog as tempting as it may be for its simplicity and go
 back to the Control Panel's tools.&nbsp; After many misses that was the only path that I found which would give me a Passcode from both devices at the same time!</p>

                    I was running this on windows 10 for quite a while. Now it doesn't load up anymore. I have uninstalled it and re-installed it via cd. Project studio loads, but doesn't properly function. The actual photo explosion doesn't even load up. There's just the

 So now I&nbsp; am at a loss as what to do next. 😬 your assistance is much appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Anthony,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue. We apologize for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Run the <strong>PowerShell </strong>
commands by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows <strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open an Administrator command window by</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right click </strong>on the taskbar and select <strong>task manager</strong>.</li><li>Click on<strong> More details </strong>located at the bottom of the task manager window.</li><li>Click <strong>File </strong>and select <strong>Run New Task</strong>. Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>CMD </strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Check the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If not, <strong>restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new <strong>Administrator user account</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persist, s</span>et your PC to private network by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> icon key on the keyboard, type <strong>Settings
</strong>and select the top most search result.</li><li>Click on <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> and select <strong>Ethernet </strong>
from the left side panel of the window.</li><li>Click on your network and slide the bar to <strong>On</strong> state for enabling
<strong>Private network</strong>.</li><li>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Likhitha v, Well, i did as you posted and managed to get the first command into the oblong blue command box by copy and paste, but unfortunately the 2nd command would not paste into the box, and i tried it 5 times but no joy whatsoever. With regards to
 my private network, i already had the bar to on when i first downloaded windows 10.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you very much for all your suggestions and assistance so far.</p>
<p>Unfortunately i am still in the same position as at the beginning of this slowly becoming Microsoft Farce.</p>
<p>Roll on Summer.</p>
