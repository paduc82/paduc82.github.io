<h2>            Cannot REN &#34;pending.xml&#34; file even with full ownership &#38; all rights - details shown within post</h2>
                    <p>As part of some work I am doing to reset my Windows Update capability, I'm renaming "pending.xml" (really "pending.xml.01cc84d0b0f2bf34"&nbsp; - how it got that additional qualifier and what it means - I Do NOT know).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, even though I have executed "takeown" successfully (from DOS) and it tassigned ownership&nbsp;to my "DOUG" userid that I am logged onto (which is an Administrator type userid), and even though I set security on it so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;I have Full Rights:&nbsp; Doug (Doug-PC\Doug) has "Full control", "Modify", "Read and execute", "Read", and "Write" and</p>
<p>(2) Indeed Doug (Doug-PC\Doug) is listed as the "current owner" when i check Properties for this file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I attempt the reanme, - regardless of whether it is done from Explorer or an elevated Command Prompt, I get "access densed" (msg returned in DOS) or</p>
<p>(in Explorer) "You need permission to perform this action" and "You require permission from Doug-PC\Doug to make changes to this file".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't figure it out - any thoughts?</p>

            My recipe in such cases is to hit the problem with hammers of increasing size (which take increasing amounts of effort to manufacture). Here are a few of them:<br />
<ul>
<li>Boot the machine into Safe Mode, then log on as Administrator.</li><li>Boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode, then open a Command Console and rename the file. Note - drive C: might become drive D: or E: in this mode but it won't be drive X:,</li><li>Create a Scheduled Task to invoke the batch file c:\Tools\Hammer.bat. Make sure it runs under the System account. Here is the code for this batch file:<br />
@echo off<br />
if not exist c:\Tools md c:\Tools<br />
ren&nbsp; "c:\..\..\pending.xml.01cc84d0b0f2bf34"&nbsp; "bad.xml"&nbsp; 1&gt;c:\Tools\Hammer.txt&nbsp; 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
(make sure to specify the correct path, then test the batch file by invoking it manually from the Command Console. Have a look at c:\Tools\Hammer.txt when finished testing.)</li><li>Use a sledge hammer by booting the machine with a Ubuntu boot CD (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/) and renaming the file. I have never seen a file that could resist the Ubuntu
 approach.<br />

<h2>            Youtube video freeze in Chrome background tab on Win 10 1803</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a lot of problems bugs me out on win 10 , I managed to solved most of them , but this last one I have no idea how to work it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is symptom:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Chrome stable , beta, and canary , just up-to-date like half hours before i type this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when play something on youtube , if tab is on front view , it works fine all the way , if I swtiched to other tab and doing some browsing, few minutes later , this youtube tab will freeze&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>by freeze I mean like the audio is still playing , but image/video just stuck , frozen for minutes , and usually it will results in dead , i have to refresh the page to it get work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>laptop is on i5 7300u , win 10 1803 , GPU driver just downloaded and installed from Lenovo official site&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can conclude&nbsp; , the issue is not on network , I got 500 mbps fiber optic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the video itself is 480p , so I guess the intel GPU from this CPU can very well handle it , correct me if it's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>same problem doesn't happen on win7 , and don't happen to firefox on win10 as well ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if it's chrom issue or windows issue ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me ...</p>

            Try following in Chrome
<br />
<br />1. Disable all extensions / plug-ins / add-ons and see if problem is disappeared. If yes, enable them one by one and check to pin-point the culprit.
<br />To do so - Click 3 vertical dots on top right &gt; More tool &gt; Extension
<br />
<br />2. Click 3 vertical dots on top right &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll down &gt; Advanced &gt; In the end below System, toggle Hardware acceleration.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your solution ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>with more test , it seems disable the HW acceleration fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>well , I don't know if it's good move , for low resolutions video like 480p or 720p it's OK I think but once 1080p video kicks in , that would be pretty heavy for CPU , right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a quick test , on HW enabled , 1080p cpu steady at 5% or so , while disable it ,it's jump to 20-25%&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>that would be huge impact on battery life i suppose ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is possible to find any workaround to this ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>well , I can settle as it is , just still , it's huge advantage i think,</p>

            Hey sf0912,
<br />
<br />You can rest easier, it's a fake security alert. You do not have to take any action besides that you can take measures to prevent such advertisements from popping up again.
<br />
<br />I noticed you were using Edge, so here are a couple of ad blockers you can use:
<br />
<br />AdBlock Plus: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/adblock-plus/9nblggh4r9nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/adblock...</a>
<br />Adguard AdBlocker: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/adguard-adblocker/9mz607gwkbs7?tduid=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/adguard...</a>(c3248b5c3cbcac2bc14ac89317789023)(259740)(2804580)()()
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hi sf0912 , well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known SCAM 
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />Do not give them Remote Access to your PC 
<br />Do not give them any personal details 
<br />Do not pay them

                    So, just llooking at all the hype about the ne Xbox, they seem to be going on and on about all the TV and sports stuff you can do with it. Assuming the new version is released at $400, the only differences between an Xbox and Roku are that you can do even
 more weird motion gestures that I never do with my current one, talk to it, make video calls (because I don't already have multiple other devices that do that just fine), and it'll show fantasyland football stuff that I couldn't care less about. Is that really
 worth $300 more than a top of the line Roku that vs bt reviews for Internet TV viewing? What about a gamers who got you here in the first place Microsoft?

<p>The simple truth is in any walk of life you get one chance to make a first impression. That's it. Once that moment is passed you can't rewind time. Microsoft blew that chance with their really dull reveal. They might have wanted to talk about TV and stuff,
 so you can't then blame people for talking about the Xbox One as a TV remote, that's what Microsoft wanted us to focus on as that was the thrust of their reveal. Clearly the people who early adopt, their prime audience for this thing at launch, didn't want
 them to do that. Yeah sure it sucks to be Microsoft, but that they got their message so horribly, horribly wrong tells me they're out of touch with the consumers that buy these devices. That doesn't bode well for them.</p>

<p>[/quote]While I do agree that MS botched their reveal, I have a feeling that people aren't giving them benefit of the doubt (I must admit I was one of them).&nbsp; But after reading some articles since (where MS has clarified somethings) there is no reason to
 doubt that the Xbox One will be a serious gaming rig in addition to everything else that MS is doing with it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
People say that they aren't as serious about the games because of all the tv stuff in the box&nbsp; But according to IGN (<a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/29/microsoft-investing-1-billion-in-next-gen-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/29/microsoft-investing-1-billion-in-next-gen-games</a>)
 MS has stated that they are investing $1 Billion in game development for the Xbox One.&nbsp; No console maker to date that I know of has committed that much money to the launch of a new console.&nbsp; Not to mention 15 NEW exclusives are coming to the Xbox One with
 8 of them being new IPs.&nbsp; That tells me that they are committed to bring games to their console (Quality ones too I hope).&nbsp; Hopefully they aren't all arcade, and kinect titles, and something tells me they aren't, but it's all conjecture and speculation until
 they reveal more at E3.&nbsp; E3 for me will probably be a huge deciding factor in whether or not I will purchase MS's next console.<br />
<br />
I have learned from the past to not let my first impression be the deciding factor on whether or not I get a certain product.&nbsp; I do agree that first impressions are huge, but I also know that some companies (as well as some people) can be horrible with them
 but have an excellent product.&nbsp; I don't know if the Xbox One will be or not, I'm no fortune teller, but I am willing to let MS put all their cards on the table before I make a final judgement.&nbsp; Here's hoping for the best.</p>

 a way you all can put this back up, or is there somewhere else to get it from?&nbsp;

            <p>No issues pop up in the action centre, and system restore is, to say it in a clean way, is screwed up. It fails every single time I try to undo one, or restore back to a different time like there's something wrong with my hard drive. Oh... could that be
 the issue? I've tried chkdisk and it comes up fine most of the time. I'll try Method 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Which I can't do anyway. I'll try to get the BIOS unlocked after Christmas from the computer store I purchased it from.</p>

<p>Oh, and I had a boot up failure a while ago (by which I mean, a few months ago), something to do with a missing or corrupt something. I can't recreate the issue, because it worked fine afterwards, even though I didn't do anything.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />It sounds like some keyboard setting has been corrupted. Here are some troubleshooting steps to try:
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Keyboard. This may fix the issue.
<br />
<br />Also, try the following:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, it may be that your user account has errors. Here are the steps to create a new user account:

<p>Hi Shibin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>UNEXPECTED KERNEL MODE TRAP</strong> blue screen error can be caused by many factors, such as
</span><span>component connectors covered in dust, faulty installed hardware or software, malware or virus, damaged system files, or incompatible drivers. For us to isolate the issue, we would like to ask the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent system changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you recently installed an application before this issue happened?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>What is the build number and version of your Windows?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend that you perform the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/12376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start your PC in safe mode</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>If the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know that the default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Method 2: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) and System File Checker (SFC)</a></strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>tools.</strong></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>These tools allow users <span>to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It is stated on the article that you need to run the DISM tool prior to running SFC tool.<br />
</span></span></p>

<p>If steam or other digital game system, </p>
<p>use the method that they use.</p>
<p>If that does not work then try to remove it </p>
<p>using the uninstall option in win control</p>

<p>Check file permissions on the games installed folder</p>
<p>to make sure you are listed as user and admin.</p>
<p>Is the drive or folder using bitlocker or some other</p>

<p>Do you have any automatic backups running.</p>
<p>Try and temporarily stop antivirus </p>

            The new official Facebook app for Windows 8.1 does not have that <i><b>chat turn off or on
</b></i>feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I wish to bring you in notice that, there are no <i><b>emoticons </b></i>and
<i><b>stickers</b> </i>in the new facebook app. Hope that facebook will bring them soon.<br />

<p>Those are only the forums you've seen it happen in, try EVERY forum. And obviously any 360 game that has Kinect (not The cheesy games made specifically for Kinect) will all have options to use it, or the controller.</p>

<p>Or, as I stated previously, a wheel in addition to the traditional controller input. &nbsp;It really is a moot point, especially since Turn 10's program director, Dan Greenawalt, discussed in an article back in March, 2011, among other things, the Kinect-powered
 head-tracking feature that will be built in to Forza 4. Here’s a snip:</p>
<p>"Forza 4 does include head tracking with Kinect. If you turn your head, your field of vision changes to match. So you can easily look a little to the left or right. The experience is user controlled and, in theory, natural since the camera is panning where
 you intend to look."</p>
<p>While using a controller or wheel. &nbsp;LOL!</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most probably, this issue might occur due to an outdated or corrupted graphics card driver. For us to resolve the issue, we recommend that you keep the graphics card driver up-to-date. For your reference, check this article on how to

            <p>According to the official support pages, windows 8.1 is supported until 2023. So why are WinRT users being left twisting in the wind so early in the life-cycle of Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody at the top should very seriously consider offering an upgrade path to windows 10 or face a class action suit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have even blocked off installing any non-microsoft OSes, so the devices are effectively paper weights because the internet is no longer usable without effective ad-blocking/script blocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security was touted as a unique selling point in the marketing campaign, yet we are still vulnerable to rogue websites because Microsoft have back-peddled on an effective built-in security essentials/windows defender solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what should RT users expecting support until 2023 do?</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>This problem is associated with an issue between Direct X and Shockwave.&nbsp; It can be corrected by either:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>1.&nbsp; Re-installing the latest Direct X<br />
2.&nbsp; Un-installing and re-installing Shockwave, if you already have the latest Direct X<br />
3.&nbsp; Both of the above<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To download and install the latest version of DirectX, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
<strong>1.Visit the following Microsoft Web site:</strong> <br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>2.Follow the steps on the Web site to download and install DirectX.</strong>

    <title>Upgrade fails from Vista to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert lehman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade fails from Vista to Windows 7</h2>
                    I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium from Vista Basic SP2.&nbsp; [Dell Inspiron 537, 4GB RAM @ 3.0GHz, &gt; 100GB free on disk]&nbsp; About one hour into the upgrade, I get a blue screen indicating that the installation has failed and that it is rolling
 back to the original OS.&nbsp; There are no error messages to indicate more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has never asked me for my Product Key. &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Following advice I have read on the site, I uninstalled iTunes and Kaspersky, and all the programs indicated by the Windows Upgrade Advisor.&nbsp; The only thing listed by the upgrade as it started was that a Garmin watch program would need an upgrade after the
 installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I did a clean boot by going through MSCONFIG.EXE, hiding the microsoft programs, and disabling everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I downloaded the WinDBG to read the setuperr.log in $Windows.~bt/sources/panther which ended with&nbsp; "Plugin {e0cbf06c-cd8b-4647-bb8a-263b43f0f974}:
 BthMig: Failed to migrate bthport keys, bailing out."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I don't have blue tooth on this desktop, and I don't see any programs that use this.&nbsp; With great difficulty, I eventually removed all occurrances of that key in the registry, and yet I still get the error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless there is an error log somewhere else that
 I cannot find a reference to, I have no clue what else to do.<br />
<br />
I'm definitely not a novice with computers, but without an error message as a hint, I am baffled at what else to do.<br />
<br />
Please advise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

You've already done some of the following, try ones you have not done yet.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.
</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2. Disable all security software: anti-virus, firewall etc. Remember to enable after words.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Make sure your computer has the most recent drivers and BIOS. Updating the BIOS can be risky, only do this if nothing else works.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. If using a video card and the computer has integrated video use that and remove the video card.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. Unplug your computer from the internet, if you have wireless disable it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>7. RAM (memory) - reduce the amount of RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful. Also if you just added new RAM make sure it's compatible.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>8. If you have multiple hard drives remove all except the one you're installing Windows 7 on, then replace after Windows 7 is installed.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>9. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.</span></p>
<p>
<span>10. If you clicked on "Upgrade" to start the install make sure you are taking a supported upgrade path. You can NOT do an in place upgrade: A) XP to Windows 7, B) changing bit type ex: 32
 to 64 bit, C) changing languages, D) downgrading editions ex:Vista Ult. to 7 Pro, or E) Vista Home to 7 Pro.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>11. Disable Startup Programs:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A) Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>C) Right below Selective Startup, uncheck the "Load Startup Items" check box.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>D) Click the Services tab, click the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box, then click Disable All.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>E) Click OK, then restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>F) Attempt the upgrade again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>(NOTE: if the upgrade doesn't work and you continue to use XP/Vista turn your security software back on, then also return to MSCONFIG and on the General tab, click "Normal Startup" then click
 OK to exit.) </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>12. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. May take awhile, only do if nothing else worked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>C) Choose your language, then click Next.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're unable to do an upgrade, you can try a custom install.<br />

<span>You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so.
 You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows 7. Here are the steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
</span></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer
 them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD. Note: Easy Transfer will not work when changing languages, or when going from 64 bit to 32 bit (it will work going from
 32 bit to 64 bit).</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>3. Locate the installation disks and any associated product/license keys for all your programs because you'll need to manually reinstall all programs. If you downloaded some programs from the Internet
 you can redownload them. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>4. Put the Windows 7 disk into your DVD drive. A window should pop up starting the install process, when asked the type of installation do you want click Custom (advanced). Note: 32 to 64 bit requires
 you to restart and boot from the DVD. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then
 you're done - enjoy Windows 7. </span></p>

            <p>You could reducing some of the installed memory to a single stick and then attempt the installation again and see if it completes.
</p>
<p>Also try the following:</p>
<p>1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade</p>
<p>2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)</p>
<p>3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.</p>
<p>4. Check your hard disk for any errors:</p>
<p>Click Start</p>
<p>Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>Click 'Run as Administrator'</p>
<p>At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any available updates for your chipset and or BIOS, I would apply those updates and attempt the installation again.</p>
<p>If all else fails, then you might want to consider a custom install:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            1 By using this adapter on my surface the problem may also arise, but if I use the adapter of another pc the problem does not occur<br />
<br />
2 I'm confused because at this point I do not know if the problem is at the level of wifi or at the system level as even trying with an external adapter my surface continues to have this problem<br />
<br />
3 I tried to disable the firewall if influisse performance, but the results have not changed<br />
<br />
4 The problem occurred immediately after you restore windows on my surface, then he tried to restore it with its image of the original system downloaded the microsoft site but the problem persists

<div><br />
<div>B - When I bought the machine was working properly</div>
<div><br />
<div>C - The device has stopped working properly after a recovery of the operating system</div>
<div><br />
<div>Q - When it stopped working I did these tests:</div>
<div>1 Reinstall Windows 8 by downloading the original ISO from Microsoft, later upgraded to Windows 10</div>
<div>2 downloads all updates including system firmware released 24/02 and all amendments up currently available on Windows Update</div>
<div>3 Seeing that the situation did not change I ripristato again without updating Windows and disabling the firewall but the problem is still there</div>
<div>4 Yesterday I again attempted a restore first with Windows 8 with its original image downloaded from Microsoft and later upgraded to 10, at first the problem seemed to have disappeared but the reboot has come back</div>

<p>I have 6 computer on my network, 4 desktops and 2 laptops.&nbsp; None of them can see one another in file explorer on the network after the April 2018 update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've verified that Client for Microsoft Network is checked on my adapter properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tinkered with the advanced network options to try every possible permutation of options, nothing is working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM able to type \\computer-name in explorer and view the shared folders, so clearly the computers are on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?&nbsp; Is this a known issue with the April Update?</p>

<p>Hi Pauli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I never used Homegroup so its absence did not affect me since I've always set up my networks myself.&nbsp; You solution&nbsp; did work but,&nbsp; I am curious about two other things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happened to set those services to Automatic.&nbsp; Should I use delayed Automatic instead? What is the difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should all machines be changed? Even those whose network browsers were always working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p><span>"never used Homegroup so its absence did not affect me"</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately removing Homegroup has effected also another parts of networking. For example referring PC's with names in the network may not work correctly on some cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting start mode to Automatic make it start during boot up with all other services and Automatic (Delayed) start those services when all "critical" services are started in boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With fast PC's and SSD disks that doesn't make big difference, but with slow PC's that may effect how fast system get running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even on my old slow Core 2 duo laptop with SSD I have those in Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made all those settings on my example to all PC's. (W7, W10 and W10 Insider Previews)</p>
