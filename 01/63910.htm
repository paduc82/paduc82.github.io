    <title>Ctrl Windows key R scam, 2017, apparently still a common issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ctrl Windows key R scam, 2017, apparently still a common issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I live in Denmark and I got called up by a "Microsoft Support central (or similar)" from a Swedish number, +46 21-45112 42.
</p>
<p>She sounded Indian from India, and she told me that she was from Microsoft and they could see my PC was infected by a virus. In her background I could hear a lot of noise, like 20 or more people calling/talking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She could help she said. I was a little confused because I just had some issues regarding attaching files to my mail, and I thought it was related to this because I joined some forums to address the issue I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the phone number on the web but nothing appeared at that moment. She wanted me to press the Windows button and 'R' at the same time so she could help. I ran the&nbsp;Windows button and 'R' command on the web and found the Microsoft community website and
 saw this was a scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told her I knew this was a scam and all of a sudden she slammed the phone on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see on the past years thread that it originates from India and there are many in a 'scam call center', disguised as Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tipped off one of our national newspapers to inform them that these scams are currently going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy that I didn't fall for their scam like other misfortune persons have and have to deal with this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Lol,</p>
<p>Me also,&nbsp;In Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with "what's-his-name" from Microsoft Support who called me on the phone telling me that my Windows Firewall had expired and that my system was reporting errors to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing that this was a scam, though I have never had the call before, I started asking&nbsp;him some questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First one I asked him was that if was from Microsoft Support then why the phone call and not a message into my Microsoft registered e-mail.&nbsp; Because it is an urgent matter was the reply.&nbsp; Your computer will cease to work within 2 days if I did not let him
 help me.</p>
<p>Said that I had turned off Windows Firewall and used a third party.&nbsp; Did not matter,&nbsp; insisted that I could not do that and that my Windows firewall was reporting errors</p>
<p>I asked him for a phone number and he gave me 1800 329 551, a national free call number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for proof of his Microsoft affiliation and he rattled off what he claimed was my Windows Product ID&nbsp; 888DCA60FC0A11CF8F0F00C04FD7D062 based within the 32 bit operating folders so he says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him for my IP address if he was getting these reports from my computer and he replied that the number that he had just given me was better than any IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said I was looking at google and the number finds there about it being a scam, he just got louder and nearly shouted over the top of me that he was really from&nbsp; Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was VERY insistent that I comply with his request to press the windows and R keys together, very impatient. And became more aggressive that I had the audacity to ask him questions about his authenticity as a Microsoft employee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end after I had kept him going for about 15 minutes, he was quite upset and getting very angry.&nbsp; He told me that he was now banning my computer from ever being used again, and was going to have a technician come around to my house with a hammer and
 smash it up before my eyes.&nbsp; I started laughing it was so comical, a scammer getting so upset with a potential victim</p>
<p>His last comment to me as he hung up was absolutely disgusting&nbsp;and not repeatable in this forum without getting banned. Awwwwww,&nbsp; poor Ravi.&nbsp; :)</p>

            Confirmed here as well March 22, 2017 FL United States from phone number 750-009-0999. There was another identical scam call from a different number 2 days ago which was March 20, 2017 that I answered. The above number called my house 4x today, I Googled
 the number and found it is the classic "This is (name) from Microsoft, your computer is sending us errors" scam. I am a computer nerd through and through, so I was going to play with them. On the 3rd call I picked up, I heard a momentary noise, and then the
 call disconnected. On the 4th call I answered and was greeted by a man with a Indian or Pakistani accent, claiming to be from Microsoft, and my computer has been sending them errors for a couple of days. He asked if I was in front of the computer, I replied
 I was, but I wasn't. He asked if it was on I replied it was. He asked me what key is on the very very bottom left of my keyboard, I replied "Ctrl" he asked what was the key next to it, I replied "FN" he then asked if the Windows key was r

            Just a quick update to the above - I was called several times today and yesterday by a man with an indian accent claiming to be from bt (uk phone provider). The last time he called I played him along and he told me there were problems with my internet
 and he could prove it if I pressed windows r keys - you know the rest.

<p>Its become a game of sorts; to see who will hang up first; I've got plenty of time to waste and plenty of mindless questions to ask them when they call......</p>
<p>Some of them do become quite annoyed after awhile; but what the hay its part of the fun.......</p>

            779-225-5079 just called me and told me the same thing. It's 4/18/2017, they called 3x today. Saying they are Microsoft and that my computer is downloading files and taking up space on my hard drive and it's not true, also that it will corrupt and destroy
 all my files and my social media. So they had me go yo my computer as I'm informing them I know they are a scam and are asking me to read off error messeges they probably tried to infect me with and or are common issues and tricking me to apparently renew
 my Microsoft certificate and that my computer will never work again.....what idiots thinking they can still pull this 2005 scam. I got out of them they want 150$ to apparently renew my cert. And if Microsoft called me it would be odd they know I have issues
 and that would meen they were spying on me. I hung up on him. It was loud and heard people making jokes of my unemployment in the background so again not Microsoft or how they conduct buisness,

            <p>Yeah, the really sad thing about these scams is that people fall for them too easily, because they have gotten a lot more creative in there slimy tactics, and end up getting duped into paying them. I wish I could shout from a rooftop that these people are
 scammers.This issue needs more public exposure, T.V. news, fliers, websites, and of course the popular video sites.&nbsp;I have been watching the videos of the scams, and what the "scamee" does is play with them until it's time to pay, then they call them out as
 scammers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to get banned or in any trouble for using the video site's actual name.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 wont boot after deleting windows.old using CCleaner</h2>
                    <p>While I was cleaning my PC using <strong>CCleaner</strong>, I decided to delete
<strong>windows.old</strong> folder. After cleaning process finished, programs never launch when I open it. I restarted the windows but it won't boot and give
<strong>STOP CODE</strong> error.</p>
<p>Here is my Laptop Specification:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Model</strong>: Lenovo z570</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong>: intel i7-2670qm</p>
<p><strong>GPU</strong>: NVIDIA Geforce gt 540m</p>
<p><strong>RAM</strong>: 8GB</p>
<p><strong>OS</strong>: Dual boot Ubuntu(main boot loader) &amp; Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is the solutions I tried and none of them worked:</p>
<p>1- Startup Repair (took about 30-45 min and gives error)</p>
<p>2- Reset This PC (exit at 36% with Undoing Changes message)</p>
<p>3- Using Command Prompt</p>

<p>How to solve this problem?</p>

</p><p>There are multiple factors that we can consider why your computer won‚Äôt boot after deleting windows.old using CCleaner. If we may ask, what is the specific stop code that is showing on your computer?

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account you are reporting will not show as online unless the account is logged in to the Skype application. It will show as offline if you are not logged in to the Skype app. Regardless of the status or presence set on your profile, the Skype connect
 number will still function as usual. To set it as online, you just have to sign in to the Skype app with the correct account.

<p>Hi Benjie, thanks for reply but I am not sure what you mean. We don't use any Skype app for this account, if you mean standard skype client for windows, linux etc.,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have just Skype Connect with SIP trunk to our PBX. When I open Skype Manager Admin I can see that SIP trunk is registered and everything looks good. kontaktnicentruminngy is associated with this SIP trunk via Skype Connect Profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I open my private skype client in windows, I still see kontaktnicentruminnogy, in my contact list, as offline.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c2833f3a-ea57-46a2-a57b-6f8a32e0db9e" title="RexonixRexonix">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I understand that. But I think you got confused about my previous statement. Allow me to clarify this to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The presence status only applies to "Skype profiles" and not with "Skype Connect". When your account is not online or is inactive for a period of time, its presence will be set to "Offline" but it will not affect your Skype Connect service. Meaning, you
 will still receive calls and make calls through your trunk line. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, you are launching the Skype client on your Windows computer but does not see your kontaktnicentruminnogy account online. This is because your kontaktnicentruminnogy account is not logged in to the Skype application or either the web version.
 Having said that, you will need to log in using that profile to a device and set its presence to "Active" to appear as online to other Skype users who are using the Skype client.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum it up, your presence or status is only an indication of your Skype account's availability and it will not affect any other service connected to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

<p>Hi Benjie,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; thanks for clarification but I am still a little confused. When I start skype app as kontaktnicentruminnogy you are right it's online for other users. But when I try to call to this account it's still ringing and Skype Connect transfer to SIP trunk doesn't
 work. When I log out from skype app, Skype connect with SIP trunk works again but status is also offline again.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there any way to be online for other users and also transfer incoming calls with Skype Connect to SIP trunk? Cos it worked in the past (few months ago). Something changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I understand that SIP trunk service works even status is offline but other people doesn't try to call you if you are offline.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;our Skype account seems for other people still offline even there isn't any active call (incoming nor outgoing). I still don't know how can I make our account online for other people. SIP trunk is connected, registered etc. In the past it was online,
 maybe something change in last few months on SKYPE side? I don't know what I can do more for make our account visible as online for other people. We use just just Skype Connect service. We don't use Skype application client for this account.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/da656f80-3f5a-4af9-b15f-c4ca0cb2d471" title="kontaktnicentruminnogy">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response and I apologize for the delay of my reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As what's mentioned, the availability status of your Skype profile will depend on what you'll set on your account when you log in to the application. Skype Connect and your Skype profile are connected but even if you are on an active call on your SIP trunk
 and you're not signed into the application using your Skype profile, then you will not be shown as "Active" on the end of your Skype profile's contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But don't you worry, the availability status of your Skype account will not affect the service for your Skype Connect's SIP trunk. In order for the account to show as active, it would be recommended that you sign in to your skype application using that account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you understand. Let me know if you have further inquiries or clarifications.

    <title>Mail App. in Windows 10 Won&#39;t Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamnordstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail App. in Windows 10 Won&#39;t Sync</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, after receiving notification from Microsoft that my Outlook.com mail wouldn't work in Windows Live Mail 2012 after 30 June. &nbsp;However, I am unable to activate the Mail app. in Windows 10. &nbsp;Every time I attempt to sync
 my Outlook.com account to the Windows 10 Mail app., I get an Error Notification of 0x80070425.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking at several other posts on the Microsoft webpage regarding this same problem, I noticed that references to the Credential Manager frequently said that in order for the Mail app. to work, the Credential Manager must be running. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
 my Credential Manager is NOT running, and I am unable turn it on (the system won't allow me to do so!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, I have no idea what my problem really is, and am worried about what I'll do for an e-mail client, once 30 June has passed, and my Windows Live Mail 2012 will no longer support my Outlook.com account!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion? &nbsp;I thank you in advance for any assistance.</p>

    <title>Could not choose choose keyboard layout when trying to recover or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bravejoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Could not choose choose keyboard layout when trying to recover or reinstall Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After running on WIndows 10 for a month, upgraded from 7, I started having more and more blue screens.&nbsp; Eventually it got to the point where I could not log in at all, it would immediately blue screen.&nbsp; Indication was possibly a corrupt driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to use the Recovery USB I and created, but it came up to a screen asking me to choose a keyboard layout.&nbsp; Neither my keyboard or mouse would allow me to choose a layout, so I couldn't go any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using the install media I had created, but the same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I was dead in the water at that point anyway, I used my HP recovery partition to reset the PC to it's original state, and then upgraded windows 7 to 10 again.&nbsp; I just have to restore my data and reinstall my apps.&nbsp; A lot of work, but I've done it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just feel like Windows 10 really let me down on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is what to do when this happens again?&nbsp; (It's just a matter of time)&nbsp; Are there any tricks?&nbsp; Should I have done something different in creating the recovery USB or the install media?</p>

<h2>            Black screen after power fail during Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    A few days ago my mother tried to upgrade from Windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;During the upgrade, her laptop's battery died. &nbsp;The upgrade was 99% done. &nbsp;The files were copied and the screen said it was getting ready when the battery died. &nbsp; Now when she turns on her
 computer she gets a gray screen with the Windows logo, a quick flash of the restart screen, then the screen goes black. &nbsp;Is there any way to get to a screen where the computer can try the upgrade again or does she have to buy a new computer?

It is created by setup for a number of reasons depending on how the upgrade was initiated, including recovery of personal data or to facilitate the rollback to that previous version of Windows if you performed an in place upgrade.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know, </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How the Windows start-up repair works...? </strong></li><li><strong>What is the difference between in-built "Repair your computer" method and using "<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/create-a-system-repair-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows system repair disc"

</strong></li></ol>
<p>Because in my computer I have installed McAfee disk encryption and it was working fine. Now my computer is not booting and But it tries load windows files and at one stage it got hanged. (I'm sure the issue was happened not because of McAfee drive encryption).
 I hope the issue could be resolved using windows repair method.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the McAfee support team suggestion (mentioned below), I can not (should not) run Windows start-up repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"It's not at all recommended to perform windows start-up repair when you have drive encryption implemented on the client machine. The reason is that, It would replace the drive encryption MBR with windows
 MBR (will corrupt the Pre-boot file system), So the result would be the system crash/BSOD for sure.</em></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px"><em>The best practice is that, First you will have to decrypt the HDD and uninstall drive encryption from the client machine. Once it is done, Please investigate further regarding the OS issues.</em>"</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In my case,&nbsp; I'm getting the <strong>Advanced Boot Option screen</strong> after logged-in with McAfee encryption login.<span>
</span>But if I tried to repair the windows using "Repair your Computer" option, it is not getting continued after loading windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Whether this (In-built) windows repair also change the MBR or it repair only corrupted/missing files...</em></strong>?

<h2>            Compression Stalled, so hit cancel now Stalled again.</h2>
                    
<p>I started to compress my hard drive, but it hung at 7%.&nbsp; I clicked cancel and now it is hung again.&nbsp; Any idea of how to fix this.&nbsp; I would hate to reboot and loose my data or not be able to access it.&nbsp; I can't find my disc that came with the laptop.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>How exactly you are trying to compress the hard drive?</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Are you trying to compress partitions?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
<span><span>I would suggest you not to compress complete hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you compress windows files, then there are chances of system going crazy or hung.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>So just compress the files which are large in size and not Windows files.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Since the compression process is hung, I would suggest you to restart the system and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can also try performing clean boot and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why is my computer saving everything to Dpinst.exe&#63;</h2>
                    My computer is &nbsp;saving any and every document/webpage/etc. as a driver, specifically as Dpinst.exe. Yes, I have tried choosing, save as and open with and I get an error message, which I can't copy and paste of course. Just when I thought this POS had stopped
 screwing EVERYTHING up, here we go again. the Action Center(boy is that an oxymoron) says I need to reconnect my File History Drive, which I've tried, yes running as an administrator with as much permission as the @#$%^ computer will give me.

            <p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p><br />
It seems like you are unable to save files with any other format other than Dpinst.exe.</p>
<p><br />
Let me collect certain information to help you better:</p>
<p><br />
1) What is the exact error message that you get when you try to save in a different format?<br />
2) Are you trying to backup the files using File History? If yes, in which format have you setup a drive with File History? Is it on a network location or using an external hard drive?<br />
3) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also suggest to restart the computer on safe mode and check if the issue is still present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link below to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persists, I would suggest you to check for the issue in clean boot state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the link below to perform clean boot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I would suggest you to run safety scanner and check if there are infected files leading to this issue. You can use Microsoft Safety scanner to do so.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
 It works with your existing antivirus software.</font></p>

</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and
 run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Important</strong>: While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might
 be lost.</font></p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to setup a different drive when you try to use File History.</p>

            <p>Sounds like malware. Are you still able to download and run files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit this link <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp;and install the free version of Malwarebyte's antimalware. Then run it and perform a full system scan. Hopefully it will detect the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise try to scan for corrupted files within Windows. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges: Go to the Start screen, type CMD , right click on it and then click "run as administrator". When ready, type the command " sfc /scannow " and
 hit enter. Wait for the process to finish. It will inform you if everything is ok.

</p><p>Anyway I solved part of it. I installed windows 10 from usb stick on my existing installation (I ran installation from windows, not from boot) and this solved problem with "Restart button does nothing". After this install I got "Fix button", which fixed
 ma Insider Preview settings.</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes it will remove PC Accelerator for you . . .
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />When that scan completes, choose to remove all threats, restart your PC and then remove MalwareBytes . . .

            Hello Transcon1,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;How long have you been getting this error?&nbsp; Have you made any changes to your operating system prior to receiving this?&nbsp; Any new Windows Updates or new software/hardware installed?&nbsp; If this has started to happen recently you could try to perform a system restore.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in
 which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
<br />

 down. I had to start in safe mode to remove Manycam but it has removed the error and my pc is now back to normal.<br />

I hesitate to do a systme restore, as this problem started when I updated my hardware drivers for video, mass storage controller and webcam and those were tough enough to do.&nbsp; Not sure exactly which one caused the problem.<br />
<br />
Acer is not big on supporting any other OS other than what the computer origianally shipped with (a 32 bit OS on a 64 bit motherboard archetecture !).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not notice any unusual behavior by closing out the box.&nbsp; I'm not happy about it, but I guess I can live with it.&nbsp;

            CyberSandy, I also recently began getting the error, and when you mentioned ManyCam, I knew it had to be the culprit, because I had installed it soon before I began getting the error. I uninstalled it and hopefully that should clear things up. Thanks for
 that info, otherwise I probably wouldn't have thought of that

<p>I too have been receiving this same message for months.&nbsp; Just been dealing with it.&nbsp; Have tried System Restore becuase of other problems I was having and that did not stop the problem.&nbsp; I guess I will try the System File Checker next.&nbsp; I have ManyCam as
 well but it came as part of the computer's software and doesn't seem right to have to uninstall it to avoid this issue.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?</p>

            I've been getting the same error too recently. &nbsp;And, yes, I've just installed ManyCam. &nbsp;I'll uninstall it and see if it goes away.

<h2>            Black Screen Cursor Only &#40;Tablet Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So im having a problem with my windows 10 tablet since it wont boot up normally. When i try to boot up the device it just shows me a black screen and you can only see the cursor of the mouse in the centre only. It wont move even if you try, also its in tablet
 mode so i dont have a lot of options on how i can fix this problem. I havent used windows 10 before and its kinda strange for me since im unfamiliar with this operating system.So in the end can anyone help me to fix my tablet or know a solution on how to fix
 it. I'd appreaciate it a lot if someone could help me. Thanks a lot for reading this!</p>

<p>This tablet was given to me by a cousin so i dont know if he has done something to it or not. I was experiencing troubleshoot when tried to connect with the internet. It wouldnt let me connect to the internet even though the connection was pretty good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i tried factory resetting the device to its normal state. After resetting the device popped up a message which said that there was trouble resetting and i choose to go with advanced option and to search for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the screen blacked out and since then it wouldnt boot up normally.</p>
<p>Sonetimes when the device is left open it will pop some codes and go black again</p>
<p>You can acess the bios and try to reset the device but it still says it has trouble doing it.</p>
<p>Well thats all for now. Its been a month since then and im still trying to fix it somehow. Hope this could help!</p>

<p>Sorry for the late response. <strong>Black screen</strong> usually happens when your monitor is unable to detect the video signal output. Since you are using a tablet, some software corruption or a third-party software may be causing this issue. To troubleshoot
 this, we recommend booting your device in <strong>Safe Mode</strong>. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Restart your PC. When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key down while you select
<strong>Power</strong></span><span>&gt; <strong>Restart</strong>. </span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong>. </span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select <strong>4</strong> or
<strong>F4</strong> to start your PC in <strong>Safe Mode</strong>. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select
<strong>5</strong> or <strong>F5</strong> for <strong>Safe Mode</strong> with <strong>
Networking</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still encounter this issue upon booting your PC in Safe Mode, try performing a
<strong>clean boot</strong>. To do so, follow the steps indicated on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 system unrecoverable after ArcGIS installation - KB973688 and KB954430 errors</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 ultimate x32 and windows update won't install two updates after installing ArcGIS 9.2:<br />
- Update for MSXML Core services 4.0 Service Pack2 (KB973688)<br />
- Security update for MSXML Core services 4.0 Service Pack2 (KB954430)<br />
<br />
I've tried several times with retry, and manual install several times with and without clean boot and safe boot (UAC disabled; admin install...). No way.<br />
<br />
Errors I get for kb973688:<br />
- Error code 643 (trying with windows update)<br />
- HRESULT: 0x800736FD (manual install try, it stops at 2/3 progress bar, saying "Publishing product information").<br />
<br />
WindowsUpdate.log says several times:<br />
- WARNING: Failed to evaluate installed rule, updateID = {...}<br />
- WARNING: Failed to evaluate installable rule, updateID = {...}<br />
<br />
Between the brackets there are different strings such as D8BD0CF7-C4A8-48A8-9B1F-E791CE07F934.<br />
<br />
I've tried uninstalling updates with Add/remove windows components but no components are shown.<br />
<br />
CrapCleaner tool (ccleaner) shows however that there is a system restore point at some point where KB973688 was supposedly installed.<br />
<br />
Finally, I've tried system restore to a couple of restore points, but restore says it could NOT restore (!?).<br />
<br />
So, my last try: clean install Windows 7, got Windows XP Mode, installed ArcGIS v. 9.2 in Win XP Mode and I was back again smooth and clean.<br />
<br />
My question is: how is it possible that any app can corrupt Win 7 to such a point!? Hopefully enough I had the chance to start again, but if not, how could I get back my system, and I mean my system restore points and my system components Add/remove options?<br />
<br />
Have a happy new year!

            I found the following solution on the ESRI website that worked for me. &nbsp;It involves a minor registry fix that gives more memory space for the Windows registry:
<div><a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1148&amp;t=287391#902480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1148&amp;t=287391#902480</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>The MS update in question above installed as soon as this fix was applied.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck!</div>
