<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Can I purchase Skype credit for someone else? </em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, you cannot purchase Skype credits for another Skype account. Since all the transactions should be initiated within the account itself. However, you can send Skype credits as a gift. Refer to this link on how.

<p>It sounds as though you’ve had a recent infection and one of your ‘anti’ programs has removed the malware files, or some of them, but not the entry in the registry. I suggest you, firstly, download and run the free Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware from
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> to ensure that you are completely clean. If you then restart the computer and the message is still appearing try one of these, but it is prudent to create a system restore point before
 you change the registry in (1) below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. The entry is probably in a \Run key, but as the rascal could be hiding in a number of other keys, it’s quicker to search the whole registry. Open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type regedit and press Enter. Click Edit &gt; Find and type agntint.dill, put
 ticks in Keys, Values and Data, then click Find Next. When it’s found in the right pane, right-click it and delete it. There should be only one entry but press F3 to continue searching, just to confirm there are no more.</p>
<p>2. If you’re concerned about making registry changes, remove the entry using the system configuration utility. In a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type msconfig and press Enter. Go to the Startup Tab and remove the tick alongside agntint.dill. Click Apply,
 OK, etc. and restart the computer. When it restarts, put a tick in ‘Don‘t show this again‘ as you‘re effectively doing a selective start up.</p>

    <title>Win 7 won&#39;t remove icons associated with newly deleted files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike hostetler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 won&#39;t remove icons associated with newly deleted files.</h2>
                    Many times when I move files from one directory to another directory, Win7 won't remove the icons that were assigned to the files that were just moved. &nbsp;This is extremely confusing because it looks like the files were never moved. &nbsp;However, if I grab the
 icons and attempt to move them again to the new directory, Win7 tells me that the files don't exist. &nbsp; Win7 also won't permit me to drag the misleading icons and drop them in the Recycle Bin.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This just happened with two files that were on my desktop. &nbsp;I attempted to place them in the sub-directory on another drive, which is where they belonged. &nbsp;The two icons remained on the desktop as if the move failed without an error message being displayed.
 &nbsp;The failure to warn me of an error would not be the least bit surprising.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes I know that it is suggested that the desktop is not a "good" location to place files. &nbsp;This warning strikes me as an admission that Win7 is broken. &nbsp;I normally do not leave files (most times internet shortcuts) on the desktop for extended periods of
 time. &nbsp;This is one of the reasons that I move files so often. &nbsp;They first get created on the desktop, then periodically I move the files to where they should actually be located. &nbsp;However, I see this problem occur more often in file folders. Much less often
 when moving files off my desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem does not always occur, however I have not yet determined all conditions that causes the problem to occur. &nbsp;What I have noticed is that the larger the number of files that I move at one time, the greater chance there is that Win7 won't remove
 all of the icons that now refer to newly removed files. &nbsp;I have watched Win7 delete most but not all icons after I have moved the entire contents of a folder to another folder. &nbsp;Win7 definitely has problems when either the source directory or the destination
 directory contains a large number of files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the first time I can remember the problem occurring when I move only 2 files. Win7 typically correct;y removes the icons if I move only a small number of files at a time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For what it is worth, I have seen this same problem with Windows XP. Refreshing the directory would make the orphan icons disappear. &nbsp;I finally eliminated the WinXP problem by&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;it. &nbsp;Because of the size of this system, and the number of programs
 installed, I do not consider reinstalling Win7 to be a viable option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It almost seems like a timing problem. The function that deletes the icons is running before Windows has updated the files as deleted. &nbsp;The files are still locked, so the function that removes the icons fails, and the orphan icons are left behind. &nbsp;Why
 do I suggest this? &nbsp;From watching Win7 many times remove some but not all of the icons associated with files that were just moved. &nbsp;This seems to happen most often when the number of icons exceeds the window size and the off-screen icons are left behind. &nbsp;However,
 this is just a guess, and not something that I have proven.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I am running WIndows 7 Professional SP1 which is completely patched and up to date as of 3/29/2013 12:49am EDT.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I leave the folder with the orphan icons, (e.g pop up one level) then return, the orphan icons are gone. &nbsp;They also disappear if I close the folder then reopen it; much like the same problem with WinXP, forcing the system to refresh the directory will
 eliminate the orphan icons. &nbsp;I can't figure out how to force Win7 to refresh the desktop without logging off then logging back in - a procedure that I consider to be excessively bothersome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following item in Folder Options | View are checked -</div>
<div>Display file icon on thumbnails</div>
<div>Display file size information in folder tips</div>
<div>Display the full path in the title bar (Classic theme only)</div>
<div>Hidden files and folders - Don't show hidden files, folders, or drives</div>
<div>Hide empty drives in the Computer folder</div>
<div>Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)</div>
<div>Restore previous folder at logon</div>
<div>Show drive letters</div>
<div>Show encrypted or compressed NTFS files in color</div>
<div>Show preview handlers in preview pane</div>
<div>Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended)</div>
<div>When typing into list view - Select the typed item in the view</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope that someone can help me - this problem is rapidly destroying my trust in Wiin7.</div>
<div><br />

            Why start a new thread? It prevents others from seeing the history of what has been done. The history helps others and lack of it will slow down the solution.

            I tried last known good and it didn't change anything . only thing I can think of is I &nbsp;uninstalled a bunch of programs that I didn't recognize as my ex was the last to use the machine, maybe one of these were a file I needed and didn't know.

            You can but I don't think you'll enjoy the experience, Verizon does a ton of traffic shaping on hotspot connections and I've read nothing but marginal results and issues with XBL. But try it, you might get lucky.&nbsp;

    <title>How do I stop clean, new Windows 10 installation on my PC syncing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex_ncfc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop clean, new Windows 10 installation on my PC syncing default settings with my already-set-up Win10 laptop&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a love-hate relationship with the Windows 10 "sync settings" options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two computers, a Windows 10 laptop which is my main system, and a desktop PC with Windows 10 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of Windows 10 on the desktop PC and set it up with my Microsoft (Hotmail) account. After set up, I did what I always do, which is go into
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts </strong>&gt; <strong>Sync Your Settings</strong> and then disabled the options for "<strong>Theme</strong>" and "<strong>Other Windows Settings</strong>" - the rest were left turned on as I find them useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went on my laptop the next day to find that my laptop had synced settings with the clean install of Windows 10 on the desktop!
<em><strong>This is madness!</strong></em> Not least because I had the <strong>very same</strong> settings on my laptop - i.e - both "<strong>Theme</strong>" and "<strong>Other Windows Settings</strong>" toggles are set to off - but when I checked in my laptop's
 settings, they were back on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So therefore my laptop had synced to the default settings of the clean Windows 10 install on my PC - and now I have no idea what settings have changed, although I notice that the Folder Options I had set on my laptop (such as not hiding file extensions for
 known types, and show hidden files) had now been set to the Windows 10 defaults. Surely it should happen the other way around?! Surely the new Windows 10 installation on my desktop should see any settings in the cloud and sync to them rather than reset all
 my laptop's settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, why is "Sync" automatically set to enabled when doing a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, other than the Folder Options that I know about, what "Other Windows Settings" may have changed on my laptop that I need to check??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, how do I install Windows 10 cleanly and make it not sync settings as soon as I log into my new install with my MS Account??</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the response Andre, much appreciated and very quick too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had actually thought about this and gave it a go, but sadly when signing in locally, the sync settings are all greyed out until you sign in with a Microsoft Account :( Any similar ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Andre Da Costa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't able to do this whilst disconnected, so I went back to your original suggestion of setting up the Local Account and then I went into group policy editor and changed the sync options in Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows
 Components &gt; Sync your Settings and disabled the "Other Windows Settings" and theme options. Then I switched over to my MS Account. I hope that this will have prevented settings from syncing in future.</p>

    <title>5Ghz Network Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blake2795  say:</h3>
<h2>            5Ghz Network Issue</h2>
                    Now I've searched online and have seen the typical response of "update the drivers" or "enable 802.11n mode" and both have been done. Now my issue is mainly that I can connect to my wifi's 2G network but not the 5G network. Here is where it gets weird.
 1: Windows CAN see 5G networks fine as I am detecting my neighbor's 5G wifi fine as well as other 5G networks. 2: The router is not at fault as both my cellphone and my mother's both run off the 5G network perfectly fine. 3: I only lost the ability to connect
 to our specific 5G network after updating windows from version 1803 to version 1809. 4: I know for a fact that windows remembers I have a 5G network as when I go to "Manage known networks" under the "Wifi" section of the settings it shows it remembers my 5G
 network. Which device is at fault here? How do I fix this? All other solutions I have tried have failed so I come here hoping someone may have an answer. Thank you for your time and I look forward to a response.

            Found a work around! So by using a smartphone that has the 5G network signal I can use USB tethering to give my pc access to the 5G network. Good news being this also charges my phone!

    <title>Streaming movies on my Smart TV through a new PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjbutow jr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming movies on my Smart TV through a new PC</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I purchased a new MSI laptop last week that came with Windows 10. Using my HDMI cable I linked it to my Samsung Smart TV. Everything works fine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except when streaming movies from Amazon Prime or Netflix. Once I play the movie it runs on my PC
 but the tv screen is black. Sound works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft support last week with this problem and a tech fixed the problem through the remote program. Yet once my PC was turned off &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the fix was erased and last weekend I had the same problem again. The Chat program wants me to buy
 a service contract now and referred me to this &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; site to find the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated as I have owned this PC for only 6 days now and it works great other than this hiccup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Hi RJButow, 
<br />
<br />Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it. Look for Video Playback (while hooked up to the TV, and not) and run it. See if it can find an issue. 
<br />
<br />What’s the model of your PC? Click start, and type “system” and open system information. Next to system model you should see the model we need.
<br />
<br />Even though it’s new, there may be an updated video driver that could help us. 
<br />
<br />Let me know, and we’ll try to figure this out!

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot did not detect anything either test run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an MSI Model GP 73 Leopard 8RE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little more background that may help. This laptop replaced a Dell Inspiron running Win 7 and this configuration worked fine. I also run iTunes, Sling TV, NFL Gamepass and YouTube on this MSI without any issues at all. The fix from the Microsoft Tech last
 week allowed Netflix to run on Edge but Amazon Prime would only run on Internet Explorer. He assumed that AP was not compatible with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he did remote access a window appeared in the upper left portion of the screen and it seemed to display options for the 2 different ways the laptop could display on the TV. Unfortunately he tested these options faster than I could follow but after trying
 each option once the movie appeared on the TV as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps you. I'll check back in tomorrow evening at the earliest.</p>

            Hmmm, 
<br />
<br />So I’m going to ask some questions to make sure we’re on the same page. You hook up the HDMI, and you can see the TV display your laptop without an issue. You can use sling TV, NFL, Youtube, etc. 
<br />
<br />But Netflix and Prime are having issues. My first thought is that they are streaming at a higher quality video (4K maybe?) the laptop has an issue outputting it to the TV.... 
<br />
<br />You mentioned IE and Edge... Can we entertain trying Chrome, just for testing? 
<br />
<br />Go to www.google.com/chrome 
<br />
<br />And download/install chrome, and try to stream Netflix/Prime via that browser and see how your TV handles it.

</p><p>Hello Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I do have some new developments to report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be the first to admit that changing from Win 7 to 10 leaves me a little slow on the up keep. We've had our Samsung for 2 years now and under Win 7 just used the HDMI cable to watch our streaming TV entertainment. We never attempted to use the App portion
 of our Samsung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used Chrome on our old system and was happy with it but was interested in seeing if Edge could do everything for us. So before downloading Chrome I noticed the App portion of the TV. Netflix and Amazon Prime were 2 of the apps already listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on Netflix accessed our Netflix account and functioned perfectly. After registering our TV thru our Amazon account we were able to access all of our Prime shows as well with no streaming issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do think that there must me something speed wise that doesn't match up in some fashion over the HDMI cable but since we have accomplished getting access to all of our online entertainment I think we've solved our problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help and guidance in this matter. If we ever have any other questions or issues I would not hesitate to come back here for an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your friend,</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I would like to get Windows10 running on my Asus N71JA Notebook (</p>
<span>
<span>
<p class="contentStandard">https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/N71Ja/) and would be happy to get some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I already tried a few times to upgrade, through Windows Update or using a bootable USB stick,&nbsp;when Windows10 wants to reboot for the first time during the upgrade, I am stuck with "missing operating System".</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here, let me state my last tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. Clean install of Windows7 with original Windows7 DVD I have, using the given product key with it</p>
<p class="contentStandard">2. Activate Windows7</p>
<p class="contentStandard">3. Perform all updates through Windows Update (Windows7 SP1, ...)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">4. Wait until I get the option to upgrade to Windows10 through Windows Update</p>
<p class="contentStandard">5. Perform the upgrade&nbsp;to Windows10 through Windows Update</p>
<p class="contentStandard">-&gt; first reboot during upgrade process -&gt; missing operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did a clean install of Windows10 using a bootable USB stick. This works, I get Windows10 running, but then cannot activate it. But this tells me, that the bios settings are fine. With the same bios settings, I can clean&nbsp;install Windows7 and Windows10,
 reboot as I like, no issues at all. Just going through the upgrade process&nbsp;leaves me with "missing operating system".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to perform an automatic startup repair through the Windows10 bootable USB stick without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please advice how to overcome this issue?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ruth</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you for your reply, I am happy to get any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your questions:</p>
<p>1) No, I did not make any changes, not with hardware, not in bios. Before, I just installed a clean win7, installed all updates through windows updates, then waited for win10 upgrade option to appear.</p>
<p>2) This time, I tried to upgrade to&nbsp;win10 through windows updates (I also tried once with a clean win7 installation, all windows updates and a win10 bootable USB stick, with the same outcome)</p>
<p>3) Just one, an SSD, see below for more details</p>
<p>4) No, I had no USB stick or any other USB device plugged in at the time I&nbsp;performed the upgrade</p>
<p>5) Yes, the system is still in that state. You can ask me anything you like to know or give me advice what I could try</p>
<p>6) I don't know how I could give that to you. Could you please advice how I could do that? I tried the following:</p>
<p>- boot with bootable win10 USB stick</p>
<p>- choose repair options, problem solving (sorry, I try to translate it, I have it in German), advanced options, command prompt</p>
<p>- there, I try C: and I get There is no known filesystem on that device. ...</p>
<p>- I also tried diskpart, then list volume:</p>

<p>
</p><p>After C, I also have an ext4 partition with ubuntu 15.04 installed, about 32 GB. This cannot be seen in the list. But this should not make any difference, as with win7 clean install, the grub bootloader was gone anyway. So, I have 4 partitions: 1 win, 2
 ubuntu, 3 data, 4 media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems strange to me is that C has filesystem RAW. I think therefore, I cannot access and read it? Please advice, if I can read it in a different way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) I have no other special device or hardware plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the way, I am writing this from another notebook, an asus transformer book tx300ca, where I had win8.1 installed before. I upgraded to win10, activated it, then made a clean win10 install with bootable win10 USB stick and everything is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Dear all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have no solution to my Problem. After this post, I got contacted by a "Windows escalation engineer" with private Messages. He asked me about my Hardware, bios Settings, about what I did. In the end, he stated that the upgrade process of Microsoft
 has an issue with certain Hardware Setups and that they are working on a solution. To mention again, a clean Setup of win10 works without any Hardware issue, only the upgrade does not work. As a Workaround, I was told to contact Microsoft answer desk, that
 they know about the issue and that I should then get a win10 key, that I could use for the clean install. But the answer desk was not willing to give me a key. So I am just left alone with this issue. Microsoft really makes me angry, I now have a Notebook
 that is not properly Setup since two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other suggestions? Anyone of Microsoft, that could contact me that know about this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

                    <p>I'm having a horrible time with drivers not working (Microsoft Signed Drivers) for things I need to get work done. Some context:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most displays nowadays are plug and play ready. When you plug a display in a Windows 10 device, it should be detected automatically. To have a better understanding regarding your concern, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Which version of Windows 10 are you currently using? To check, click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>WINVER</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Are you getting an error message when attaching another display?</li><li>Will you be able to reproduce the problem and send us a photo when the display comes erratic?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

<p>Hi Kris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Windows 10, v 9, Build 16299.19.</p>
<p>The screen(s) are attached via VGA socket on the Lenovo laptop to be used as a second screen.</p>
<p>There is no error message as such apart from, VGA Input: No Input Signal.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d6855e6-3c58-4289-9dd5-015c97270bbb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d6855e6-3c58-4289-9dd5-015c97270bbb" /></a></p>
<p>If one disconnects the cable message will be to check Video Cable.</p>
<p>The phenomena happens on either of HP screens when connected, drivers having been installed manually.</p>
<p>If you click on the Detect button in Settings&gt;Display Settings nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheerio,</p>
<p>Val</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>

<span>Is the issue specific to any particular photo selected for the screen saver?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incorrect system file settings. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are have Windows 7 installed on the computer then you may follow these methods and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may restore the computer to a previous date when the computer was working fine and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore uses restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time, without affecting personal files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore: frequently asked questions</span></strong><span>:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Important: System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files
 are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once this is done, you may select a different photo for the screen saver and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows comes with several screen savers. You can also create your own screen savers from personal pictures that you've saved on your computer,
 and there are screen savers available to download from the web.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Microsoft Windows and Windows-compatible software rely on a collection of .dll files, also called Dynamic Link Library files. These files contain instructions that all Windows components can use
 to carry out requested actions. If these files are either missing or broken then the application associated with these files also do not work properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend you to perform a SFC scan and check if the issue persists. The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
 For more information how to do SFC/ scan on Windows Vista and Windows 7, please follow this link:

<h2>            Windows 10 Interface is Laggy or slow because of the display driver not installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I was disappointed with windows 10 because it is slow and laggy! So I went to device manager and update my Display driver. But I have an error code 43. So what I did was to shutdown the computer and turn it back on then BOOM PANIS! It was so fast
 and snappy!! This are the things what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) press windows key + X then choose "Device Manager"</p>
<p>2.) Look for Display Adapter then right click it and choose "update driver"</p>
<p>3.) windows will automatically search the driver for you if it failed it will direct you to the manufacturers website to download the latest driver for windows 10.
</p>
<p>4.) It will Install the driver but on the end you will have an error code 43 but that is ok!(that is what&nbsp;I experienced)</p>
<p>5.) Just shutdown then turn it back on! then BOOM PANIS! Windows 10 is now fast and snappy. If you will check device manager you will see that display driver has now the name of the manufacturer of the hardware!</p>

            <p>I tried this method too but the main problem I had was that my laptop is W8 &amp; W10 Unsupported by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>I reinstalled my drivers manually using <strong>compatibility mode </strong>and this time mostly seems to have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had <strong>SLOW BOOT</strong>....Very!!!!</p>
<p><strong>NO Battery Icon</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Could Not / Cant Switch Bluetooth </strong>(<em>permanently on</em>).</p>
<p><strong>No Brightness Control</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive Battery Drain</strong>.</p>
<p>Just <strong>Very Slow </strong>and <strong>Sluggish</strong>.</p>
<p>One or two more which I cannot for the life of me think of this moment.</p>

            <div>SOLUTION:</div>
<div><strong>Preliminary remarks:</strong><br />
As we all know Windows OS always bring problems.<br />
The boys of Redmond, since upgrading to W7, have failed to resolve how to adapt drivers on updating.<br />
Ie we moving from XP to W7, W8, W8.1, and W10, and always the same problems: drivers.<br />
It seems that is user problem, when it is not.<br />
The problem is always Windows.</div>
<div><br />
Happily, any MVP, or any employee of the Technical Service will tell identical answers:<br />
1. Update<br />
2. Uninstall<br />
3. Reinstall<br />
4. Update again<br />
5. If this problem is not resolved, they will blame the manufacturer of your PC.</div>
<div>But again, the problem is always Windows.</div>
<div>How to troubleshoot drivers?<br />
Unless you're a NASA college, you can not do it without a guide.<br />
When will you ask for help, they will make you reinstall everything again, at the risk of collateral losing, or directly, your computer.<br />
Some drivers could fry your computer completely forever.<br />
For example, the BIOS drivers.</div>
<div>As I've already broken a couple of PC's by the MVP's advices, I learned to force ignoring them.<br />
1 Never mind them.<br />
2nd Investigate on your own.<br />
3rd If in doubt, read the item 1 again.</div>
<div>Let's think about, using logic.<br />
A driver is a program, that tells Windows what type of components has your PC.<br />
For example: what video card, what sound card, etc.<br />
When updating Windows, the video card IS THE SAME (as other components of your PC).<br />
This means Windows changed, no computer.<br />
Therefore, you do not need new drivers, because your PC IS THE SAME.</div>
<div><br />
What does Windows with drivers when upgrading?<br />
It copy without reinstalling.</div>
<div>For that reason, some work, some do not. Depending on the type of driver.</div>

<strong>SOLUTION:</strong><br />
On update (for Windows 10), your former drivers are in the folder:<br />
C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers<br />
(I recommend that you copy into another PC, or DVD and keep)<br />
All have their installer "setup.exe", and you can use them, in case of formatting your PC in the future.</div>
<div>This time, (because it is an upgrade Win 7 or 8, 10) we will from the "Device Manager".<br />
(Right click on the Start button of Windows 10. It's at the top of the list)<br />
In the case of the video card, it is among the first in the Device Manager.<br />
It's called "Display Adapter" (click).<br />
Then right&nbsp; click, at the driver (Intel or AMD).<br />
Choose "Update Driver Software".<br />
Choose "Search for driver software on your computer".<br />
Here you have to put the folder on your DRIVER (which is dependent).<br />
Example: C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers \ VGA_PH \ Graphics<br />
OK.<br />
Restart.</div>
<div><br />
The driver is updated, and before restart, could operate normally control brightness.</div>
<div>I repeat, that you can also update the drivers with the "setup" of the driver concerned.<br />
Anyway I do not recommend using the "setup", except in the case of a clean installation (not an upgrade).</div>
<div>That is all.<br />
Your brightness control problem and will be solved.</div>

<h2>            Music and sounds are coming through too high pitched and too fast.</h2>
                    Music and sounds are coming through my speakers too high pitched and too fast. Sounds like Alvin and the chipmunks. It happens on all sounds whether from a CD or over the Internet. All diagnostics check out okay. It's Windows XP. Any ideas how to adjust
 the sound quality?

            Hello Jcbrewer,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;Take a look at the information below that I copied from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0067.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0067.mspx</a>.</div>

Why does my music sound like chipmunks are singing?
<p>
Don't worry, small rodents haven't set up housekeeping in Windows Media Player. Instead, your sound card's clock most likely has a timing problem. To fix the problem, try reducing the hardware-acceleration level for your audio card by doing the following:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
1.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
In Control Panel, open Sounds and Audio Devices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
2.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
On the&nbsp;<strong>Volume</strong>&nbsp;tab, in the&nbsp;<strong>Speaker settings</strong>&nbsp;area, click the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
3.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
In the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Audio Properties</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Performance</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then adjust the&nbsp;<strong>Hardware acceleration</strong>&nbsp;slider control to adjust the clock timing for your sound card.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Keep in mind that, if your sound card supports multichannel (5.1) audio playback, turning off hardware acceleration (by moving the slider to&nbsp;<strong>None</strong>) will cause the sound card to play all multichannel audio in stereo (two speaker) sound.</p>
<p>
If you can't fix the problem by adjusting hardware acceleration, you can check with the computer manufacturer for an updated sound driver.</p>
<p>
Another possibility would be that this could be a prank of some sort. &nbsp;You can perform a clean boot that will start the computer without any 3rd party programs. &nbsp;The steps are below:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>.
</li><li>
Type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">msconfig</span>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>&nbsp;box,
 and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.
</li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>General</strong>&nbsp;tab, click&nbsp;<strong>Selective
 Startup</strong>. </li><li>
Under&nbsp;<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the following check boxes:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Process SYSTEM.INI File</strong>
</li><li>
<strong>Process WIN.INI File</strong>
</li><li>
<strong>Load Startup Items</strong>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
Click the&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;tab, click to select the&nbsp;<strong>Hide
 All Microsoft Services</strong>&nbsp;check box, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Disable All</strong>.
</li><li>
Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.
</li><li>
When you are prompted, click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.
</li><li>
After the computer starts, start the game or program and check whether the problem is resolved.
</li></ol>
<div>
If the problem is resolved, you can check in Add/Remove programs to see if there is any&nbsp;suspicious software that needs to be removed. &nbsp;You can also check your startup programs in MSCONFIG. &nbsp;To get to msconfig, Click 'Start' &gt; Select 'Run' &gt; Type&nbsp;<strong>msconfig</strong>&nbsp;in
 the box and hit enter. &nbsp;There you will see the startup tab, you can check for any suspicious programs that are starting at startup and remove them.</div>
<div>
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing with Windows Update might be due to corrupted Windows Update components. Let's determine the exact cause of the issue. To get started, we'd like to clarify if this is this you first time to encounter this issue. If so,

            <p>Hello Jadeavery,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community as per your post I understand you are not able to find your office applications after upgrading to Windows 8. I can
 help you fix the issue however, would like to know some details.</p>
<p>1: What version of office was installed on your computer before upgrading to Windows 8?</p>
<p>2: Do you have a disc or a product key for office?</p>
<p>Since you did an upgrade office software needs to reinstall to work on office applications.</p>
<p>Please revert if any clarifications.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

            My laptop and home computer did the same thing. They both came pre installed when I purchased the computers. So no I do not have a disc or product key. You really need to find a way to fix this. They both were installed with the office versions that came
 stock with windows 7. This is ridiculous. I even selected keep all apps files and settings and it still did this to both computers and I am not spending $400 to get them reinstalled on my computers.....

            I thought I had the Professional x64 version, but there is a x86 file in the .old folder.&nbsp; I tried the 25 digit code I have on file to reinstall using both the professional x86 and x64 links you provided, but I keep getting the "not a valid&nbsp;Office Product
 key" before any install starts.&nbsp; Can you provide me a new valid&nbsp;code or perhaps direct me to a driver in my .old folders that will reinstall office 2010 Professional? This is VERY frustrating to buy an OS upgrade for $40 only to have it disable a previous
 purchase of Office that costs $400, not to mention the opportunity cost of being down for&nbsp;over a week!&nbsp;

            Well I'm in the same boat. I had no idea that keeping Windows "Settings" was asking "Would you like us to keep Microsoft Office?"
<div><br />
<div>I checked the other option because it made it seem like a "fresher" install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Am I now out what I paid? I don't have a code since it came installed on my new Dell...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ugh...</div>

            Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; I used to love my laptop, bought it over the summer.&nbsp; Now, everything except Windows 8 has been removed from my computer.&nbsp; I do have files, but I am unable to open anything since Microsoft Office has disappeared.&nbsp; I don't want
 to try to resolve this issue myself, I've already spent way more time on this issue with no success.&nbsp; I also do not feel I should have to pay someone to fix it either.&nbsp; I hate Windows 8, wish I never installed it.

            <p>Is someone ever going to respond to how to correct the problem when you&nbsp;DID select "Keep windows settings, personal files and apps" and Office 2010 was still&nbsp;removed?&nbsp; Because the problems isn't how we should have upgraded to Windows 8, but what should we&nbsp;do
 when the upgrade failed to do what it promised which is keep Microsoft Office.&nbsp; Office did&nbsp;NOT appear in the non-compatible list that I check before installing Windows 8.&nbsp; I have product key from a Windows Office&nbsp;Professional 2010 purchase from just one month
 ago... but that does absolutely no good when I try to reinstall it and I refuse to&nbsp;believe that I should purchase&nbsp;Office again when I&nbsp;was only upgrading to a compatible&nbsp;OS&nbsp;from the same company!&nbsp; And no one has yet responded as to how to "reactivate" the non-working&nbsp;Office
 files in the Microsoft.old folder.&nbsp; I'm very frustrated with responders to this and other similar&nbsp;threads assuming that the problem was user error rather than what it is... Windows 8 NOT upgrading properly!</p>

            <p>Install an Open source office such as Apache Office: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.openoffice.org/</a>&nbsp;and you should be able to open anything you need from Microsoft Office and the suite is FREE.&nbsp; If your Microsoft Office came&nbsp; preinstalled on your laptop and is Office 2010 Starter&nbsp;it is incompatible as installed. Believe there
 maybe an update available to fix this. Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 laptop fall asleep after movement &#40;hardware&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>my laptop is frequently falling asleep, it turns black right after I grab it to move.</p>
<p>I've bought new MSI GS63VR in about January this year, but my past about 7 years old laptop was turning it self off (no battery) while grab and move it, so I started to think if it's not a system W10 thing since I had no problem with the last one while still
 running W7/ linux, I believe the hardware of my MSI is alright since it's relatively new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second thing which started the same time as the falling asleep was, when my battery is low (about 10%) it turn itself off completely in the same way if I hold the power button a while. It doesn't say the battery low statement as it usually does, plus the
 battery last about half time as it was new, but my system could be a bit messy&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't found any help on other forums, just someone has problems with PC turning it's display off, so I want to mention that's not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Plus if you don't mind me asking off topic thing, is it ok to have this stats? 25%&nbsp; CPU use with apps using like 3% and 32% of memory while my ram is 16GB and apps using few % of it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, I would really appreciate help.</p>

<p>Hello Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop falling asleep can be due to an outdated drivers. To isolate the cause of this and identify if
 this is a hardware or software issue, we need additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>Does your laptop connect to a power supply when you're moving it?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you also tried performing the power troubleshooter? If you still haven't, you can check the steps below:</span></span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows + X key</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Control panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>In the search box, type Troubleshooter and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click on the view all option on the left panel and select <strong>Power</strong> and click on Next button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you can create a new power plan and check. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting these
 settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>About the CPU usage, it's possible that there's a 3rd party program/app that
</span></span>is running in the background that consumes memory and processing power.<span>To
 identify the culprit, you can also perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. It is performed
</span><span>to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to your reply.</span><span><br />
