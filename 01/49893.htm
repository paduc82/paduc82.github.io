    <title>Upgrade from Windows XP to 7 Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtkb715  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Windows XP to 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    Had trouble downloading windows 7 Ultimate&nbsp;on my daughter's pc to replace existing XP.&nbsp; Unexpectedly it finally took but it wiped out all other existing programs, including audio. Before this, she was wirelessly hooked up to our home network which only
 consists of 2 computers running FIOS. My computer is currently running in Safe Mode while awaiting a new hard drive, so there are many things I also cannot do. However, even in this condition my daughter was able to connect wirelessly to the internet with
 XP. Now that I have replaced it with Windows 7, I don't seem to be able to reconnect the network so she can use her computer. Since she is in a different room I don't have a wire long enough to hook her up. Since I am not really educated in this sort of thing,
 any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were certain checks that you could have run to see if the machine was Windows 7 Compatible before installing Windows 7 over XP on it.</p>
<p>__________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you install a new Operating System, in your case Windows 7,&nbsp;you have to go to your Computer/Laptop or Hardware Manufacturer's website &gt; find the Drivers and Sofftware Support/download Section &gt;&nbsp;key in the Computer/Laptop or Hardware Model Number &gt; then
 look for the Windows 7&nbsp;Operating System's Drivers (AUDIO, Graphics, Network Adaptor, Chipset, Wi-Fi&nbsp;etc, etc)&nbsp;&gt; then download and install them to make your Computer/Laptop work correctly with the new Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your daughter is in another room to the Internet Connection, you can use any machine with Net Connection (the one you are using to get here)&nbsp;to download the Drivers to the Desktop, etc &gt; copy them to a Flash Drive &gt; transfer them to her machine that way
 and install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no Windows 7 Drivers available, that means that the Manufactuer does not support running Windows 7 on that machine and Windows 7 will not work correctly for you.</p>
<p>_________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And your machine needs to start in Safe Mode with Networking to be able to access the Internet, not just Safe Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
<p>

            <p>Windows 7 Ultimate does not support a direct upgrade from Windows XP. So all your programs and hardware drivers would need to be reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Common hardware that will likely need to be reinstalled include Network/Wireless adapters, Audio, Graphics (Video driver) and any other device you have installed or connected to your computer such as a printer/scanner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can normally find these drivers at the manufacturers website for your computer, if they don't have native Windows 7 drivers you can Windows Vista drivers if those are available. Windows XP drivers might work for hardware like your sound card.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hardware is an essential part of using your Windows PC. These days, adding new hardware can be as simple as plugging in a mouse to hooking up multiple displays, connecting game consoles and dealing with the ever frustrating printer setup. All of these accessories
 can lead to a lot of complexity, but Windows 7 does a good job of making the installation painless, but sometimes we need to take&nbsp;action to make new hardware work.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we’ll take a look at common task associated with installation, updating, and
 troubleshooting hardware in Windows 7.</p>
Installation
<p>This involves setting up the hardware and preparing it for use. All hardware products require a small piece of software called a driver, which contains a collection of instructions it provides to Windows with the information about how the hardware should
 be used and configured. In Windows 7, you can install a hardware product in a number of ways, the easiest is by using Devices and Printers located on the Start menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image87.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb87.png" height="456" width="567" /></a></p>
<p>New in Windows 7, Devices and Printers provides a visual collection of all devices installed and connected to your computer, such as Web Cams, your system unit, printers and even your smart phone or mp3 player. If you would like to&nbsp; install a device, click
 the <strong>Add a device </strong>button on the command bar.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image88.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb88.png" height="202" width="488" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image89.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb89.png" height="433" width="563" /></a></p>
<p>This will start the ‘Add a device’ wizard. As you can see, I don’t have any newly detected devices, which means, if I am installing a printer or a phone, I need to connect the device first, then turn it on.</p>
<p>Some hardware devices only require that you connect the device. From there Windows will automatically find a driver and install it or the device will install the driver.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image90.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb90.png" height="236" width="543" /></a></p>
<p>When you receive an error message like the one above, it means Windows does not have a built in driver for the device you are trying to install, or the current driver is not compatible with the version of Windows you are using. To fix this, you need to go
 to the manufacturer’s website and obtain a compatible driver.</p>
<strong>Updating drivers</strong>
<p>Updating a driver is not necessarily about resolving compatibility issues, updating drivers can also provide enhancements, increased reliability of the device as well as better security. The best place to obtain updated drivers for a device is the manufacturer’s
 website.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image91.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb91.png" height="506" width="575" /></a></p>
<p>Drivers can normally be found in the Software or Downloads section of a web site. Finding the right drivers means you must first search for the model device you are seeking drivers for. You can start by going to the Support section of the website. For this
 first example I am looking for driver software for my Nokia 3120 cellular phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image92.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb92.png" height="305" width="552" /></a></p>
<p>To quickly find the drivers for your device, you can refine results by using the websites Search feature. In the above example, I simply enter the model number which filters to the particular model I am looking for. Once you have found the device you are
 looking for, click it, this will take you to the applications summary page.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image93.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb93.png" height="446" width="565" /></a></p>
<p>Click the Software link for the device and you should be taken to a page with all available updates and drivers for that device.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image94.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb94.png" height="284" width="555" /></a></p>
<p>Click the download link and save the driver software to your hard disk.</p>
<strong>Updating computer hardware drivers</strong>
<p>Lets take a look at updating the drivers for our computer. There are a variety of computer brands and models out there. So, searching for updated drivers might not be the same across manufacturers. Again, you can normally start by looking in the Downloads
 section of the website. For this example, I am searching for updated drivers for my brother’s Dell&nbsp;Inspiron 640 M laptop.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image95.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb95.png" height="456" width="566" /></a></p>
<p>You can start by looking for the Support section of the website. Most manufacturers will make it easy to find by providing a direct link to the drivers and downloads section of their website. Once you have found it, click it.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image96.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb96.png" height="481" width="557" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on the manufacturer, the requirement to download drivers for your computer might be a bit different, but the information is often easy to find. For instance Dell uses a combination of methods. You can use the Service Tag found on the bottom of
 a laptop or at the back of a system unit to go right to the downloads section, enter a serial number or just the model of your machine.&nbsp;You can also find such information in your owner’s manual.</p>
<p>For this scenario, I will use the Model number of the machine.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image97.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb97.png" height="267" width="552" /></a></p>
<p>Dell’s website uses a bread crumb menu approach to finding the drivers for your system. First, you start by selecting your form factor, this can be either a desktop or laptop.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image98.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb98.png" height="280" width="546" /></a></p>
<p>The next step is to select the product line, manufacturers offer a wide variety of choices that target certain markets, whether it’s a large enterprise, consumer or small business. In my case, the laptop my brother uses is a Inspiron, so I will select that
 from the product list.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image99.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb99.png" height="269" width="542" /></a></p>
<p>Finally we arrive at the section where we select our model number. The model number can be easily identified with the product line, in my case it’s a Inspiron 640m. Once you have found it, click it then click Confirm which will take you to the download section
 for this particular model.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image100.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb100.png" height="444" width="535" /></a></p>
<p>Another step you might be required to accomplish is identifying the installed operating system. This will help to ensure that you download the right drivers for the version of Windows you are running. Sometimes there are no native drivers for the operating
 system you are running. In the case of this Inspiron laptop, it was manufactured in June of 2006 and originally came preloaded with Windows XP Home, fortunately, it was tagged as Windows Vista capable. Since there are no Windows 7 native drivers, the next
 best option is to use Windows Vista drivers, they might not be the latest, but Windows Vista and Windows 7 share the same driver model, so they should work just fine.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image101.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb101.png" height="347" width="549" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have found the driver you need, click the Download button and save it to your hard disk and proceed to install when complete.</p>
<strong>Windows Update</strong>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image102.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb102.png" height="435" width="570" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft also provides driver updates through its Windows Update service, so you can always check there for updates to common hardware devices such as your printer, network adapter, or even your video card. To use Windows Update, click on the Start menu
 and type Windows Update. rom there you can check for important and optional updates.</p>
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>
<p>When you encounter a problem installing a hardware device, it can be attributed to a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Incompatible driver</strong> – the driver software does not work with the version of Windows you are running and you need to obtain a new version. Sometimes updates to an operating system can break a driver that was previously compatible with the
 operating system. The best thing to do is check for the latest driver. If none is available, there is another option, which is not guaranteed but can work in some cases, its called Troubleshoot Compatibility.</div>

<p>To install a driver using Troubleshoot compatibility, point to where the driver files are located, right click the setup.exe or .msi file and click
<strong>Troubleshoot compatibility. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image104.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb104.png" height="429" width="561" /></a></p>
<p>This will start the Program compatibility wizard.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image105.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb105.png" height="434" width="568" /></a></p>
<p>You will be given a couple of choices, the first being Try recommended settings that the operating system thinks will be suitable for this device driver. Or you can manually select the option to troubleshoot the program. For the purposes of this article,
 I will select Troubleshoot program</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image106.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb106.png" height="435" width="569" /></a></p>
<p>If you have determined the program worked in an earlier version of Windows, check that option and click next.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image107.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb107.png" height="444" width="581" /></a></p>
<p>Select the version of Windows the driver worked under then click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image108.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb108.png" height="452" width="591" /></a></p>
<p>Click Start the program to see if the driver installs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Administrative privileges</strong> – drivers interact at a deep level of the operating system called the Kernel, which is the heart of Windows. Accessing this area of the system requires Administrative privileges. Because of changes to how Windows
 handles certain drivers, certain drivers might not have the right to access the kernel since they have not adopted the new model of writing drivers. Fortunately, Windows 7 includes work arounds for this.</div>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image109.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb109.png" height="345" width="568" /></a></p>
<p>Simply right click the driver setup file or .msi file and click Run as administrator. This will give the software driver all the privileges it needs to install properly so you device can function without any limitations.</p>
<p>The ultimate reality of hardware compatibility is that sometimes, we have to let go. Yes, that HP Deskjet you bought in 1997 is certainly a work horse, but because of advances in operating systems and manufacturers own desire to innovate and offer support
 options for newer model devices, support for older ones have to be discontinued to reduce the cost which can even be a burden for large hardware and software companies. Microsoft has tried to ease compatibility with Windows 7 by offering these many solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, some computers use something called shared graphics, which means the graphics in your system uses some of the main memory to help render the interface. So, if you have 2 GBs of RAM in your computer, some of it might allocated to graphics. Sometimes
 the manufacturer of your computer might be conservative and allocate just the bare minimum. If you would like to adjust this, consult the documentation that came with your computer, this often requires going into the BIOS settings for your computer.</p>
<p>If your computer has what is called a discrete graphics card or what is known as a dedicated video card from a known vendor such as AMD or Nvidia then you probably need to download the latest driver which can enable additional capabilities.</p>

            Hi Sam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is really annoying that this would happen, but I'm not sure how.  I have both dated folders (created by importing and Photos app) and subject folders I create that have never been touched by any Update, Reinstall, Reset or Fresh Start.  Of course they need to be backed up before a reinstall of any sort, because otherwise they are always at risk - but files that are not backed up are always risked because a hard drive can die at any time without warning.  
<br />
<br />So my advice would be to use your backup or if you don't' have one, as soon as you get the folders organized again, back them up to both an external hard drive and the cloud.  You can even now use OneDrive Folder Protection to move your Pictures folder into OneDrive so it is always backed up in real time to the cloud.  See more here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />I can vouch for this because I have had my User folders moved into OneDrive for years without problem.  You get real time backup wth no risk.  But I'd also have a backup to flash or external on site that I regularly update by copying the latest User folders there.
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Internet speed on PC slows down drastically when the laptop is plugged into charging</h2>
                    So my laptop runs on windows 10 and I use wifi connection for internet.What happens is,every time I connect my laptop to charger for charging it,the internet slows down drastically.However,if I switch off the charging,the internet speed goes back to normal
 like before.How can this be fixed?

            <p>The main thing I could think of to at least look into if you haven't already are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Update the drivers for your wireless adapter</li><li>Find out the specific adapter in your laptop to help search forums to see if there is a known issue with it</li></ul>
<p>If you need to find out what the card is you can do this by right clicking the Start menu and going to Device Manager, and then checking for it under Network Adapters<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a36ba8a-46a3-41d4-864c-1e0b00594bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a36ba8a-46a3-41d4-864c-1e0b00594bb0" /></a></p>

            <p>From the screenshot you provided your adapter would be "Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter". So what you would typically want to do now is go to the manufacturer site for your laptop, find the model of laptop you are using on the site, and then go to
 the section for that model that has drivers available for your computer. Once you are there typically there is a dropdown to indicate your operating system, and then sections that contain the different types of drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say for instance your laptop was an HP Elitebook 755 G2, I went to support.hp.com and put in that model in the search, and then when I was on their page for that model I went to "Drivers and Software", and put my operating system as Microsoft Windows 10
 64-bit<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdb5589c-e30d-4536-9243-c7080cdfdc31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdb5589c-e30d-4536-9243-c7080cdfdc31" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll see at the bottom are the Network drivers. So for my example say I determined I was using a Broadcom Wi-Fi adapter I would know which one on the list to get. From here it'll download an executable file you can run to update the Wi-Fi drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't help, knowing the Wi-Fi adapter can still help you look into the issue. You could do different searches like "Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn&nbsp;Windows 10", "Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn&nbsp;slows when charging", "Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Windows 10 known issues"
 etc. It would also help in those searches to combine it with whatever your laptop model is. So at the least you'll be able to get more useful results and you can look around to see if other people have run into that issue with your particular adapter/laptop
 model.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Clean Install&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone I have a question and will try to explain it to the best of my understanding....basically though, I have a brand new version of Windows 7 Professional. I built my PC in mid/late December and everything has been working GREAT....except for
 one thing. Everytime I shut down or restart my PC I get a BSOD error 0x0000009F&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a ton of research and apparently it is one specific thing but can be caused by basically....anything. So I worked here&nbsp;http://www.sevenforums.com/bsod-help-support/389010-bsod-after-shutdown-restart-error-0x0000009f.html with this fellow trying to
 come to a solution and I think he disappeared or maybe it ended up being more than he had expected? Not sure, I sent a PM and didn't hear anything back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am kinda at the point where I am just going to do 1 of 2 things....</p>
<p>1.) Clean Install of my Windows 7 Professionl</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>*preferably* 2.) I have the Windows 10 upgrade thing popping up, is it possible to utilize that but instead of just moving everything over to Windows 10, just do a complete clean install with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in regards to that....I have a few motherboard driver questions if I am allowed to ask that here as well.</p>

For persons who needed to perform a clean install of Windows 10 from the outset, it was a two step process of first validating the machine through the upgrade routine, ensure the Windows 10 Upgrade was activated, then proceed to perform a Reset.

A custom install is similar to a clean install, but instead of wiping the hard disk clean, your previous Windows installation is moved to a folder called Windows.old. Windows.old is an archive of your old Windows installation. It is created by setup for a number of reasons depending on how the upgrade was initiated, including recovery of personal data or to facilitate the rollback to that previous version of Windows if you performed an in place upgrade. A custom install is sometimes initiated by booting from the Windows 10 install media (DVD or USB thumbdrive) or if you start the installation from within a previous running version of Windows at the desktop 
 personal files from the Windows.old Folder such as Documents Pictures and Windows Live Mail Emails in Windows 10</span></a>

            <p>First question haha in regards to the reply, do you mean I could "try" or can it 100% be done? I am just worried if its not 100% that I could run into something that I don't know how to repair/fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard question.....I have the ASUS Maximus VIII Hero motherboard, drivers here&nbsp;https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/MAXIMUS-VIII-HERO/HelpDesk_Download/</p>
<p>
</p><p>When doing a clean install (which I assume could be related to a COMPLETELY fresh build/install of a new custom PC) I use my Motherboard disk to access the internet etc so I can update drivers. If you took a look at that Motherboard Driver page, could you
 possibly tell me which ones to update and in which order?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason I ask is because I have heard multiple things, but essentially...."Don't fix it if it's not broke" or "Don't update anything until you need to" and "Just update them all it can't hurt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to "just update them all" if it doesn't hurt....however from my understanding there is a "preferred" order to install the drivers in and that is what I am confused about. I just don't want to mess things up this second go around. Also.....do
 I do the motherboard drivers before doing ANY Windows Updates or do I do the Windows Updates first?</p>

    <title>how do I do auto-mounting in windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> proprietary softwares  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I do auto-mounting in windows</h2>
                    <p>I come from linux. In linux, we have a /etc/fstab file that tells the "mount" command what to mount as the root directory and what to mount as the home directory... Here is my problem that may require a fstab-related feature:</p>
<p>I have two disks. When I installed windows I somehow had RAID set up. My EFI is on one disk and my C drive is on another. Now I need to migrate my C-drive partition to the drive with EFI so Windows only uses one disk. I decided to use MiniTool Partition
 Wizard to clone my C-drive to the disk with the EFI partition. However, this does not boot. Windows complains that my "PC needs repair". My guess is that Windows is still looking for the original disk for the C-drive, but I already unplugged that one. But
 I am not sure since Windows does not work like linux. How do I tell Windows to start my new partition as C-drive?</p>

            Same problem here on Dell XPS L502x on Win10. Crashes every time it comes out of sleep. It works fine with hibernate, but that takes time. Coming out of sleep makes it go through the entire process of rebooting which takes awhile. &nbsp;

    <title>Keyboard will not work with Start menu search and apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard will not work with Start menu search and apps</h2>
                    Hello, I am having an issue where the start menu search and apps does not work with the keyboard. It works on third party apps, such as Google Chrome and Word. It will NOT work with Windows apps, such as Calendar, Weather, Mail, etc. However, I did find
 a solution by searching online, that if I run a command line in CMD, and type in ctfmon.exe, the keyboard starts to work in Start Menu search and apps as well. The problem is, is that I have to put that command line every time I turn my computer on, or have
 to restart it. I started having this problem since I upgraded my Windows 10 to version 1703. Is there a way for me to permanently make the start menu search and apps to work automatically when my PC restarts or turns on? Please help. Thanks.

                    Even on the second attempt to install Service pack 3 Automatically the installation freezes up both times.
<br />
Is there something i can do?<br />
or do I just refuse the update next time it is offered?<br />

<p>In large Upgrades, Microsoft may have made it to install a piece at a time to not intrude on sessions. TRY to shut down the computer rather than restart and this will begin an install process. You will see the warning on the blue screen to not dare turn
 off youre computer while the installation proceeds and will shut off automatically when installed.
<br />
<br />
Other than that have you ever had any trouble with a previous Service Pack or perhaps retrieving Windows Defender updates or other microsoft services ? That could lean towards or indicate a piracy copy ? ....

<p>Microsoft does now have, and is instituting to a greater degree, the <br />
validation of your Windows Operating System against a piracy bootleg copy - <br />
which will be denied Windows Updates.</p>

One of the many benefits of owning genuine Microsoft software is gaining <br />
access to Microsoft Support Services. Below are two ways to help you <br />
determine whether your version of Windows is genuine.</p>
<p>....any trouble with this ?</p>
<p>MORE: WGA - Wikipedia (excerpt)<br />
On Windows Vista, WGA validation failure has a greater impact. In addition to persistent notification and the disabling of non-critical updates, WGA also disables Windows Aero, Windows Defender, and ReadyBoost. The user is given a grace period in which to then
 pass validation, after which most of the operating system is disabled and Windows reverts to reduced functionality mode, which will be removed in Service Pack 1 of Windows Vista.<br />

            Most likely the installation is broken up into three parts.... repeat the process with Windows Updates on Automatic.... Shut it Off and look for the blue screen with the dialouge "Do Not Shut Off..... Updates are Installing.... Will automatically shut
 the computer off when installed...." Rerun and shut down until it is entirely installed.

<p>Sorry that is <strong>not</strong> correct. What you are talking about pertains only<br />
to 32-bit versions of Windows, and he has 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>Moreover, even with 32-bit Windows, the actual number is always <strong>less</strong><br />
than 4GB. Here's my standard post on the subject:</p>
<p>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just Vista/XP/7) have a 4GB<br />
address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the<br />
theoretical upper limit beyond which you can not go. <br />
But you can't use the entire&nbsp; address space. Even though you have a<br />
4GB address space, you can only use <strong>around</strong> 3.1GB of RAM. That's<br />
because some of that space is used by hardware and is not available to<br />
the operating system and applications. The amount you can use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can<br />
range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around<br />
3.1GB. <br />
Note that the hardware is using the address <strong>space</strong>, not the actual<br />
RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM<br />
goes unused because there is no address space to map it to. </p>

<h3> milenpopantonov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credential Provider v2 DIsplay in &#34;Other User&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello I am working on migration of Credential Provider v1 to v2. I can display my provider under last "login user" or "other user" according to the example sample:</p>
<p>
</p><p>// Gets the SID of the user corresponding to the credential.<br />
HRESULT CSmartCardCredential::GetUserSid(__deref_out PWSTR *ppszSid)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;*ppszSid = nullptr;<br />
&nbsp;HRESULT hr = E_UNEXPECTED;</p>
<p>&nbsp;if (_pszUserSid != NULL)<br />
&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;// ppszSid will be freed by Logon UI<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hr = SHStrDupW(_pszUserSid, ppszSid);<br />
&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;// Return S_FALSE with a null SID in ppszSid for the<br />
&nbsp;// credential to be associated with an anonymous user tile.<br />
&nbsp;else <br />
&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hr = S_FALSE;<br />
&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;return hr;<br />
}</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to display my provider under &nbsp;"login user" AND "other user" , but "ICredentialProviderUserArray *users" returns only one user (example):</p>
<p>
</p><p>HRESULT CSmartCardProvider::SetUserArray(__in ICredentialProviderUserArray *users)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;if (_pCredProviderUserArray)<br />
&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;_pCredProviderUserArray-&gt;Release();<br />
&nbsp;}</p>
<p>//DEBUG COUNT</p>
<p>&nbsp;DWORD dwUserCount;<br />
&nbsp;users-&gt;GetCount(&amp;dwUserCount);</p>
<p>
</p><p>//DEBUG CPAO_NONE</p>
<p>&nbsp;CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_OPTIONS crao;<br />
&nbsp;users-&gt;GetAccountOptions(&amp;crao);</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;_pCredProviderUserArray = users;<br />
&nbsp;_pCredProviderUserArray-&gt;AddRef();</p>
<p>
</p><p>so my question is "HOW CAN I SET ICredentialProviderUserArray SO IT RETURNS "OTHER USER" AS WELL?"</p>

</p><p>Hi Raven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of reasons that may cause your PC to shutdown while playing the game such as a malware or virus infection. It is a good idea to scan your PC just to check if this is the case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for problems with an app from the Windows Store, you can run this <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
troubleshooter</a> to scan and attempt to automatically repair any issues found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Free windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillipbooty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded a dell laptop a couple of years ago from windows 7 to windows 10 when microsoft were offering the free upgrade.</p>
<p>I used it 2 or 3 times after the upgrade but literally haven't used it for a couple of years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago I booted it up and to my surprise it's reverted back to windows 7&nbsp; Why would this happen ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before anyone thinks I've mistakenly just thought I'd upgraded it but didn't, I definitely did and even put a windows 10 logo sticker on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry to say I didn't try it butI tried to reinstall windows 7 from a disc because it was running very slow.&nbsp; It's installed but I'm getting "No connections are available"&nbsp; and&nbsp; desktop is displaying everything large so I guess I'm missing some drivers.
 Been on the dell support page and entered the e6220 service tag number but I haven't a clue which drivers I need for internet access and to display the right size.</p>
<p>Wish I hadn't messed about trying to reinstall win7 and just followed your advice with the win10;</p>
<p>I did actually manage to download the win10 onto a USB drive but when I insert it and boot the laptop it starts the win10 install but asks me for win10 product key which I don't have. I only have the win7 product key but it won't acccept that. So this laptop
 is totally useless at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update,</p>
<p>I've managed to download and install the network and video drivers from dell site (just downloaded and installed all of them) and so Laptop is working ok again with windows 7</p>
        </p>

<p>When you installed or Upgraded to Windows 10 years ago your PC was digitally registered with Microsoft, therefore no product key is required to reinstall Windows 10. During the installation process when it prompts you to enter a product key just "Skip" entering
 the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>============================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation in Windows 10<br />
Digital entitlement is a new method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with the original November update, Windows 10 (Version 1511) can be activated using some Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 product keys. For more info, see the section Activating Windows 10 (Version 1511 or higher) using a Windows 7, Windows
 8, or Windows 8.1 product key in this topic.</p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>============================================</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As a safety measure you can backup Windows 7 before you install Windows 10. If Windows 10 fails to install or automatically&nbsp;activate you can always use the backup to quickly reinstall Windows 7.</strong></p>
