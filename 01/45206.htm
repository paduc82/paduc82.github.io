<h2>            Constant &#34;Low Disk Space&#34; warning after update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On Monday, my Windows 10 laptop updated and ever since then, I've been getting this warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf86833c-4bf5-4b42-a3ce-6654b3fcf3cf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf86833c-4bf5-4b42-a3ce-6654b3fcf3cf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I've been trying to get rid of the warning, but nothing is happening. I keep trying to get rid of things in Local Disk (E:) but apparently there's nothing in there to get rid of. What should I do?</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Daniel, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume E
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=E
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

                    If I go into properties, there is no option to change the Share settings. Seems to have started when I plugged in my Kobo Reader today as it no longer recognizes it. Then I plugged in a USB stick and it does not recognize it in My Computer, but does on
 the task bar for removal. <br />

 my pc restarted, i kept getting this "the computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation connot proceed. To install windows, click "OK" to restart the computer, and then restart the installation. I pressed ok, but
 my computer keeps going to this same error. I already googled this error and i saw the "regedit" method. I tried that on my pc but i couldn't find the setup in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. The only thing i could find in that folder is &nbsp;~ &nbsp; &nbsp;ab(default) -- REG_SZ

            Hi Riley, 
<br />
<br />Please follow this guideline: 
<br />
<br />1 Go to the â€˜Control Panelâ€™ and categorize by â€˜Small Iconsâ€™.
<br />2 Tap on â€˜Network and Sharing Centerâ€™ and select â€˜Change Advanced Sharing Settingsâ€™.
<br />3 Tap on the button to â€˜Turn Off Network Discoveryâ€™ and then Save the changes.
<br />4 Restart your computer to complete the process.
<br />5 Re-enable Network Discovery to access the router interface from Genie.
<br />
<br />Write me back if it works or not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.

<p>Andrew N,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution did not work for me.&nbsp; I use Windows 10.&nbsp; When I open control panel devices and printers, I get 1572 multimedia device icons showing.&nbsp; A few are legitimate, the vast majority are about half and half Genie Media Servers (Russel{Windows}) or PC:RUSSEL.&nbsp;
 RUSSEL was my computer name, and I have changed it to RUSSELA to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a Netgear router up until 2 or 3 years ago.&nbsp; It has been physically disconnected and unused since then.&nbsp; Now using a Qwest router.&nbsp; I looked for any netgear apps or programs I could find and deleted or uninstalled any I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device and printer list remains the same after all I've done.&nbsp; Seems like you can remove device from Devices and printer list, but only one by one.&nbsp; I tried highlighting more than one of the Genie Servers, and the remove device command does not appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One at a time for over a thousand icons,&nbsp; nah!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or advice for removing theseis pesky items.</p>

<h2>            Program freezes - can&#39;t install or uninstall</h2>
                    <p>I've gotten a new computer. Like my old one, it runs Windows 10. I have a program called Paint Shop Pro 9 that I enjoy using. I tried to install it on my new computer, and it got most of the way installed, but got stuck while "registering modules". I couldn't
 get it to cancel, so I shut down my computer. When I restarted it, it appeared as though PSP9 had installed just fine. But when I click on the shortcut, I get an error that says "this action is only valid for products that are currently installed." When I
 go to the file in Programs and choose to open it, it starts to open and freezes during start up and I have to use task manager to stop it. However it's not listed among my programs when I go to Programs and Features or in "Apps and Features". It comes with
 it's own uninstall feature but the first time I ran it, it got partway and froze again. After that, when I run that, it gives me the "this action is only valid for products that are currently installed." But the program is still on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd REALLY like to figure out how to use it on this computer. I used it a lot!!! But at least I want it off of here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I'm no pro but I'm no newbie (even though I like a graphics program that is ancient) - in fact, I'm the tech support for our Women's Center and our small church. I'm respectfully scared but am willing to adjust the registry if I know what
 to do (yes, I know to back it up first!)</p>

<p>
</p><p>The picture of what you want was on the Windows 10 build 15063 Creator's Update (1703)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The picture of what you are getting now is from the newest build Fall Creator's Update 16299.15 (1709) that was released on Oct. 17...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You newest machine must have already updated to it... The one you are looking for no longer exists..</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the PSP... I'm just guessing now, but you might check to make sure .Net Framework 3.5 is turned on... You can do that in Programs and Features and click the button on the upper left...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also install the DirectX Runtime Redist. June 2010...</p>
<p>It is a optional update to older DirectX 9 and 10 graphics files that that may be needed by PSP... You would expect to get an error message specifying that, but maybe not...</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. I recommend trying to turn the phone all the way off and remove the battery then wait a minute or two and power it back up. Afterwards if the problem persists uninstall and reinstall the App and let us
 know with a reply if the issue continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out!</p>

<p>Hey Brave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify a few things before we go further with troubleshooting. Is this a feature that worked for you before? Are you able to view comments while on another device? What about when you are logged into a different account, or not logged in
 at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your cooperation here, and I hope to find you a solution as fast as possible. Right now, I'm thinking it may have to do something with your privacy settings.
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Doublecheck your privacy settings </a>to make sure nothing is restricted in relation to viewing other people content/comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try the following (please follow the order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the app's cache from the Android 's settings</li><li>If you didn't solve, logout and login again to the app</li><li>If you didn't solve, uninstall and reinstall the app</li></ul>
<p>Let me know if some of these help you solve the issue!</p>

<p>I'm having the same issues as OP. Running Android 4.4.2. The comments feature in the Xbox App used to work fine, up until a couple of weeks ago. Since then, every single item in my activity feed shows no comments and says "Be the first to comment", whether
 there are already some there or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried clearing the app's cache, then when that didn't work, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and the problem still persists. Comments work fine in the Windows 10 app, as well as when viewing my feed on the console itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that viewing and adding to comments is probably 90% of what I use the Android app for, this is a pretty frustrating problem to have.</p>

<p>I can confirm this is not an issue with his phone nor is it an issue with his profile. This is a widespread issue affecting many people if not everyone. Its a glitch with the xbox app as comments are viewable on consoles just not on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the owner of a few clubs and me and everyone in these clubs can not view comments. I am a memeber of other clubs i do not own and everyone in these clubs also can not see comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have friends who are in clubs i am not in and they also can not see comments made in the clubs and no one else can see them either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i can confirm its not just an issue with Android phones as i am on iphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue started for me and everyone one else at the end of October - start of November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported it to xbox support but they tell me they have limited resources and also that they cant report it to anyone that can deal with it only that i have to post it here to the forums.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Power issues Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series and windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an Dell Inspiron 15 753.</p>
<p>Latest BIOS and Grafic drivers installed.</p>
<p>Since I updated to Windows 10 I have serious power Problems.</p>
<p>When I close the lid it should go to sleep, what it does.</p>
<p>When opening the lid it should wake up and nothing happens.</p>
<p>I have to press and hold the power button to force shut down and then restart normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it won't shut down completely when choosing shut down on the power menu.</p>
<p>According to DELL this is NOT a known problem, and all they advice is to wait for an update?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the solutions I found in different threads are for WIN 8.1 or different Netbooks.</p>
<p>I never had this issue with WIN 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now need urgent Help</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep
 mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the
<strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> and see if it helps. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Press

</p><p>Skype moved to cloud structure, thus old data cannot be carried over to the new platform.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new Skype, all the instant messages youâ€™ve sent and received in your conversations, as well details of any calls you've had on Skype are stored in the cloud for 2 years, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device.</p>

<h2>            Says Win10 incompatible but it installed and works fine</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is mainly for Microsoft* - are you listening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(*I couldn't find a sensible place to try to send this, maybe this will be monitored...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several (about 10) MSI Wind U180 Netbooks&nbsp;(in different rooms) as well as a few other PCs/Laptops (about 4 others, some I 'downgraded' from Win8 - bleah!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Aside, they are a CCTV, TV, Radio, Music, Clock, Video Intercom&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;and even interface to the Home Automation system too - so you can tell I'm 50 shades of geek.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all have Win7 on them and specifically the netbooks had Win7 Starter - so they are all kosher, paid for and above board versions of Windows (32 and 64 bit mix too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the 'get Win 10' tool says the netbooks are incompatible (laptops etc. don't get this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried downloading and installing (actually Win 10 Pro, but it not staying) and they are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heck I even tried installing this on a very old (and unused) Advent/Uniwill(came with Vista, 'downgraded' to XP) and that went fine too - very useful to see if I wanted to bother with moving to Win 10 at all too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm quite prepared to buy a copy of Win 10 Home (Â£100, ker-ching) and will do so, I honestly want MS to stay in business (and this is from someone who actually likes Linux, but TV drivers etc. just aren't as prevalent).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, MS if you want a better (less lumpy) revenue stream, charge me for annual updates - Â£20-50 per year I wouldn't even think about!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why tell me it can't run it when it patently DOES!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually found this topic via a search for something different. I too have a u180 (mines dual boot now, XP and 7Starter)* , the only difficult part of that was getting a decent/working video driver but I managed eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Yes I do have a legit copy of XP to use for it as well. The reasons for it being DualBoot I'll spare you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I too was planning on doing a 7 to 10 upgrade with this little unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got several desktops that were running 7 (Pro for the desktops) as well and one of those also downloaded 10 then complained it was not compatible. What I simply did was use the .iso to start the upgrade (from within 7! do not start it from a reboot!)
 and it upgraded fine, without complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it for a few days until it activated etc, then simply did a quick fresh install to remove any clutter left over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All has been good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm saying really is (take a backup of it first) is if the 'get 10!" is complaining, just use the iso to start it. Get a physical dvd of it however and run setup from that, within 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy.</p>

            <p>Hi, a couple of questions on installing win10 on a U180 netbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How well does it run, any quicker or slower than win7 starter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you get the video driver? When i ran the win10 compatibility app it said win10 wouldnt work because no video drivers were available&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Slower than W7 Starter. Not much though</p>
<p>2. With difficulty, I used some drivers (just extract all the zips etc) that seemed suitable then let it pick what it wanted. The resolution does not use the full one though it used a slightly lower one (I can't remember it off hand and I've not got the
 U180 to hand to check) as I only use it for car diagnostics</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Regarding drivers in general, get your driver CD and copy it to the desktop etc, then extract any .zips there are. Finally just point each item in Device Manager at this folder. Let it install anything if it wants. Do not forget the chipset items too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does work, ignore the warning about no vga driver. :)</p>

    <title>Virus filling up hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harmonijak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virus filling up hard drive.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having this problem where this virus keeps filling up my hard drive(only&nbsp;the C one)&nbsp;with invisible files. I've had this problem for a while now(probably around a year-ish and yes, I'm that lazy/careless of a doofus to start dealing with it now). Anyhoo,
 I did some research and found out a way to&nbsp;go back in time basically by system restore so I tried that but, my computer says it doesnt have any restore points, so basically I am screwed if that's my only resort.<br />
Is there any way to get rid of this awful virus? Any help would be so very much appreciated because this is getting really tiring.<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Steven

<h2>            Windows 10 0xC000012A start error</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 on a fairly new Dell Computer.&nbsp; Last week I found the computer in a "Repair Loop" attempting to restart my computer after an apparent Windows Update.&nbsp; I have tried System Restart Repair, All Safe Modes and cannot complete a Restore point
 installation. &nbsp;I ran Ckdsk /f /r and have errors.&nbsp; sfc scannow does not correct the issue.&nbsp; Are there other options available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have not installed any recent hardware or software to the computer. &nbsp;The update was an unsolicited automatic Windows 10 update. All restore efforts I have made have been through the "Blue Screen" as my computer will not progress beyond the recovery loop.
 &nbsp;Safe Modes and all recovery options short of reset with or without saving files have been tried. I've read that those restore/repair options may fail if my drive errors are not corrected. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Keith</p>

<p>Since after doing the provided troubleshooting steps, the issue till occurs, we suggest that you perform a clean install. A clean install is an operating system installation that overwrites all other content on the hard disk. Unlike a typical OS upgrade,
 a clean install removes the current operating system and user files during the installation process. See this article:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10</a> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>

    <title>Skyp not running. Unable to receive calls to my Skype phone number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtwinter1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skyp not running. Unable to receive calls to my Skype phone number</h2>
                    <p>I am appalled at the inability to contact someone directly at Skype to resolve an issue that I have been working on for 3 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: Callers are unable to contact me on my Skype number. My icon says that I am online, but no calls are coming in. I use Pamela to record my calls for my podcast, but it gives me a message that Skype is not running. I am furious that the people that
 I talk are unable to contact me at scheduled times during the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no live support so I have relegated myself to hoping that this problem has a solution. I have followed the directions in a previous question here:</p>
<p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/virtual-agent/?partnerId=skype&amp;flowId=skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>And nothing has worked so far. I am now paying for a service (telephone number) that I am unable to use or cancel because there is no support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little help here would be great.</p>

</p><p>Although Skype community is another option to post your concerns and questions, or look for the same thread that is similar to your concern which has been resolved or answered, we have limited support when it comes to accounts and billing issues such as
 cancelling subscriptions, processing refund requests and etc. In this case, I highly suggest to contact our chat support. Please check the private message I sent you, for further investigation.â€‹</p>

<h2>            Stuck on windows error recovery screen</h2>
                    Have a toshiba laptop and vista updated itself. This cause my screen to go black and wouldnt turn on or off. Took battery out and back in and it restarted however the next time I turned it on got the windows error recovery screen which said.<br />
Windows Error Recovery<br />
Windows failed to start. A hardware or software change might be the<br />
cause. If Windows files have been damaged, Startup Repair can help<br />
diagnose and fix the problem. (Use the arrow keys tio highlight your<br />
choice.)<br />
1) Launch Startup Repair (recommended)<br />
2) Start Windows normally<br />
<br />
Both options return me back to the error recovery screen and I cant get past it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Probably need to re-install the audio/sound driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong>
<p>Fixing a customer problem: â€œNo Audio Device is Installedâ€ when launching sndvol on Windows Vista<br />
<strong>&lt;- read this link<br />
</strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area -<br />
check Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower<br />
Right click Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do<br />
same for Configure on Lower Left of that box.<br />

In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.</p>

<p>Hey there Helen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the Email, password the information that you are looking for? If it's not go ahead and let me know what it is you are looking for :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always&nbsp;go through the&nbsp;support article to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/forgot-microsoft-account-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find your Microsoft account email address</a> to see if you are able to retrieve the Email address.
</p>
<p>The password is information that you won't be able to find, If you do not remember the password you should be able to reset it once you have found the email address you used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to retrieve the email address then I would suggest <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contacting Xbox Customer Support</a> and requesting to chat with an agent, or requesting a callback to get help with this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi! Thanks for such a fast reply!</p>
<p>I had a windows phone and played a lot of games on it. The information was stored in my Xbox account. Now i have android, and i want to move some of my save files. For that reason I need a cloud where my save files are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g., android:... +the sequence of numbers and lettrrs etc. Is there something like that on Windows? I can't contact game customer care from that account, because i have no windows phone already</p>

<p>Hey Helen thanks for keeping in touch!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest signing into the Microsoft Account the games were played on and look at the order history (for purchases) also any downloads attached to the account are just that attached to the account they aren't console or device specific. The only thing that
 needs to happen is to sign back into the account in question (like a recovery process) and all the games and apps should come up. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>

<h2>            How to fix &#34;network connection timed out&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is an on-going problem with my Dell Inspiron 530 deskstop with&nbsp;an Intel 82562 V-2 10/100 Network Adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional message states " Make sure network settings are correct and your network connection is active".</p>
<p>Most of the time this problem occurs while on the Internet and is very irritating. The only way to get the connection back is to re-boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to modify my settings to prevent this problem? In addition could it be that my AT&amp;T DSL is periodically dropping me off? Or is my 2Wire Gateway 2700HG-B&nbsp; going bad?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your input.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is always the possibility that hardware goes bad.</p>
<p>Your 2Wire is actually a Modem Router.</p>
<p>Log to the Router look at WAN side and make sure that it configured to keep the connection alive.</p>
<p>If this device was given to you by the ISP call their support, they will help with this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have to establish whether you lose the connection from the computer to the Router, or the Router loses its connection to the Internet.</p>
<p>When you do lose the connection try to connect to the Routers menus (read the manual) if you can connect to them than it is Internet connection problem.</p>
<p>Here you have some "stuff" about this Modem/Router.</p>
<p>This is for an ATT connection YMMV.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 sleep&#47;wake BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkflip1981  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 sleep&#47;wake BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, so I have read through tons of post regarding sleep issues with win10.. A few months ago, I finally let the win10 update install on my machine... shortly after that I began&nbsp;running into issues.. Over the past two weeks, it became unbearable.. Was
 losing&nbsp;work.. So, with that not really an option, I had to dive in to the best of my limited knowledge and try to fix the issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Updated bios and NVidia drivers</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Complete Clean install of win 10 via usb boot drive.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;disabled fast boot in both win 10 and in bios</p>
<p>4.set all sleep functions to never</p>
<p>5.Updated Intel Management Engine Interface (which had a seemingly good effect)</p>
<p>6.Upgraded firmware of my SSD. (seemed to be the last of the problems)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having done all of this, the machine was running like a dream.. would go to sleep for hours and wake up flawlessly with no BSOD.</p>
<p>But now, it happened again. The situation seemed to suggest that every time the computer went to sleep, upon wake, it would lose the drive and restart into the bios which was not recognizing it. As if the drive is lost when the pc sleeps for more than 10
 min. And the only way out of the bios is a hard restart of the machine in which case it usually boots right up into the OS with no problem. &nbsp;But that is all a problem. I use sleep mode more than most and I need my machine to function.. it is running much better
 than before, but what do I have to do to resolve this!!!!?</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>The BIOS may need to be updated and some drivers. If yo can provide a screenshot of system summary I can check out your bios version date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>start &gt; all apps &gt; windows administrative tools &gt; system information</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/961c0100-310d-467e-b08b-72b12930e756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/961c0100-310d-467e-b08b-72b12930e756" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The page that comes up will have the information needed, at least down to Baseboard name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use device manager to check for drivers automatically while on line. Best to start the PC and do not run any other programs but device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click start and select device manager. Drop down the device you wish to update and right click the device, select update drivers. It would not hurt to do these devices.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Computer</li><li>Display Adapter</li></ul>
<p>If any unknown device or error show in device manager you can post back.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>BIOS is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zigzag knows how to read the dump files. The only other thing I can suggest is do you run a third party antivirus like Norton, or McAfee?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know your way around bios setup there is (or maybe) an option "OS Type", if it is set for Windows 8 try and change it to "Other OS".</p>

            <p>Yep.. BIOS is up to date.. cant really be any virus i dont think because i formatted the c:/ drive before my clean install.. read the entire "how to get your dmp files" page and still no luck... i did notice that my pagefile.sys only reads at 2.37Gb where
 the instructions suggest it should be larger than the physical memory of 16Gb.. which makes me think im misunderstanding the dmp how-to.. by the way, i noticed that it wasnt stated on my system info, but my hard drive is an ADATA SX900 SSD with firmware version
 5.2.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gonna keep trying to figure out how to get the DMP files so i can give you a better look at what might be happening.. Thanks for the help so far.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the make and model of the sound card?</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong>I would suggest you to perform clean boot on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />
Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps provide in the below article to perform clean boot. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> <span>
Try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card driver.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp; </span></div>
<p><span>Here is how you do it:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click Start, type<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>in the Start Search box,
 and then press ENTER.<br />
b.&nbsp;In the Device Manager dialog box, expand <strong><span>Sound, video, and game controllers</span></strong>.<br />
c.&nbsp;Locate the audio device that was included with the computer. <br />
d.&nbsp;Right-click the device, and then click <strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;Click the <strong><span>Driver</span></strong>tab, and then click<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;Make sure that the<strong><span> Delete the Driver Software for this device</span></strong>check box is cleared, and then click<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
g.&nbsp;In the Device Manager dialog box, click the <strong><span>Action</span></strong>menu, and then click<strong><span>Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed, and then the uninstalled audio device appears in Device
 Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>h.&nbsp;Close the Device Manager dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try downloading the latest drivers from the manufacturerâ€™s website and install it.</span></p>

    <title>Bluetooth not working in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miksau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Stream 11 laptop, which I updated to Windows 10. The update process went smoothly, but now bluetooth doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the Realtek driver and now it recognizes nearby devices and connects to an already paired device, but I cannot pair new devices. The pin number shows on the other devices, but not in the laptop. The pairing process gets stuck there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Safe mode didn't seem to load bluetooth drivers, so I couldn't check if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I ran the troubleshooter, which found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC scan found corrupt files and repaired them. The problem persists, bluetooth still can't pair devices. I'm now rebooting to see if that helps...</p>
