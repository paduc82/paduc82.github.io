<h2>            Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    My new Dell desktop is running version 1607.&nbsp; It says updates are current.&nbsp; Is it OK to go directly from 1607 to 1709?

            So you're not planning on purchasing a McAfee subscription before the 30-day free trial expires, is that correct?
<br />
<br />Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not activating, uninstalling, or upgrading cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.
<br />
<br />Comment: Chances are the Fall Creators Update will not successfully install (manually or via Windows Update) as long as the McAfee application's still present.

    <title>Skype Addin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielring1990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Addin</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone would be able to shed some light on this ongoing issue that I've been having with the Skype Addin on a sole persons laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First problem that is happening is the Skype Addin constantly unchecks itself upon restarting Outlook. I checked online and the only solution was that there might be a Lync Addin that is disabled but sadly this is not the case in this instance. I have run
 a repair on office but this still did not fix the issue. Also this is MS Office 2016 that we are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second issue is she is unable to set a skype meeting up in one of our other colleagues calendars. It comes up with an error stating she does not have permissions however I have given her full permissions to the mailbox via the Office 365 Admin Console and
 on the colleagues mailbox I have given editor rights via the delegate access to all attributes (Calendar, Task etc). So I have mirrored mailbox permissions of the accounts in which she can set up skype meetings for however just this one colleague she can not
 set up meetings for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? As I am now at the point where I'm completely out of ideas. I'm reluctant to uninstall and reinstall as Skype works when she is setting meetings up for others. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows 10 after hardware change</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running into some issues with re activating windows 10 after I changed my motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the story is that I purchased my computer from a store in my city and it had windows 8 installed and updated to windows 10 when that came out.They didn't give me the windows dvd,only a recovery dvd wihtout an activation key.</p>
<p>That was 5 to 6 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently the MSI motherboard in my computer stoped working so I changed to an ASUS board,but windows isn't activated now.I know that it ties with the hardware and that to re activate it you have to run the troubleshout and choose the option that says you
 changed hardware.I did that and when the option to choose a device came up it showed my Laptop (which I use the same microsoft account on) and my home pc with a MSI underneath the name.</p>
<p>I clicked on that (since it was really the only option),and it said that windows couldn't activate.</p>
<p>Don't know what to do now</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a legit activated copy of windows on both my devices (home pc and laptop) and I have a microsoft account which I used to log in on both of them,even after the change as soon as I opend the pc with an internet conection I had to log in with the same
 account...so is there something I can do now?&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM Windows 8 licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 based on a Windows 8 retail licence?

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you sure the PC you changed the hardware upon was linked to your MS account?  If not you can still change hardware even if the underlying original license was OEM as you're granted a one-time exception if all else is correct, but it might need to be done via Support since the Troubleshooter may not see it if you don't know for sure it was linked to your MS Account .  
<br />
<br />Was the MSI listed clearly your old PC?  If so then it may just be overloaded servers which is a frequent cause of these rejections now that we are approaching a billion WIndows 10 users.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />

<p>I am not sure to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that since the place I bought the computer from is a pretty big company by my countries standards they don't a retail licence on every pc they sell.</p>
<p>So OEM is my guess</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something i can do if its an OEM licence?</p>

<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass. 
<br />
<br />Activate Your Windows 10 License via Microsoft Chat Support
<br />Use the following link to directly reach a live agent who can assist you:

<br />You have a retail license, so all you need to do is contact chat support and explain the issue and they will reactivate it for you:

<p>But my windows were always up to date if that matters at all.</p>

<br />Most likely not, however, you could try Microsoft Support and see if they will give you a one-time exemption to transfer that licence . .

    <title>Theme Pack is not working, please help. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sierraritter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Theme Pack is not working, please help.</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded Windows 8.1 last night and was browsing the themes and found a Fable Anniversary theme pack, well that's awesome- my favorite game, downloaded it, went to my desktop, personalize, it's not there... okay, I checked my downloads(where it
 instantly puts them) it &lt;is&gt; there. I have downloaded other themes before. I downloaded Eerie Autumn and Creepy Cobwebs when I first got it and they show up in my downloads folder, and in my personalize, but not Fable. I downloaded another one randomly, seeing
 if maybe it was just Fable that was not working, but it does not work either... I have no clue why it's doing this and have no clue how to fix it, please, please help.</p>
<p>Thanks for you time. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which web browser are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Themes are located&nbsp;in this location: &nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\Resources\Themes. <br />
</strong>Please navigate to this location and check if it is downloaded here.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help, you can go directly to the website, download the theme to the desktop.

 but when I go to &lt;personalize&gt; it, it's not there.

            <p>That's okay for the delay, it's not really a big deal- it's more I just can't figure out &lt;why&gt; it's not working, more than I'm bothered it isn't.
</p>
<p>To the first bit, I have been pressing 'Save'. I don't know if it helps, but whenever I press open, it says "windows photo viewer can't open this picture because either photo viewer doesn't support this file format, or because you don't have the latest updates
 to photo viewer". That appears on the themes that &lt;do&gt; work as well. Since I first bought this computer I've never been able to just &lt;look&gt; at the pictures of the two Themes I downloaded, but they show up in Personalize and they work. For some reason the Fable
 Theme and any new theme I try to download just doesn't work.</p>
<p>I've tried to change the download location folder and that doesn't do anything as well. I've saved it in numerous folders, my desktop, and it does the same thing every time.

    <title>External display doesn&#39;t work with tablet docked outward - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External display doesn&#39;t work with tablet docked outward</h2>
                    Recently I wasn't able to display through my second monitor even though it was recognized by my surface book. I tried rolling back/updating drivers, diagnostic tool and checking the cables/display with other devices.<br />
<br />
When I detached my tablet and docked it the standard direction, the second monitor finally worked - however it won't display when the tablet is facing outwards.<br />
<br />
Could someone provide me with a solution to this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Anthony<br />

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Studio Mode works just like Tablet mode. The keyboard provides additional battery time and allows you to use its USB ports, but the other functions will be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us what monitor you are connecting the Surface to? For a list of compatible monitors with the Surface, go&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023468/surface-troubleshoot-surface-dock-and-docking-stations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the monitor you have is on the list of compatible monitors, let's troubleshoot the issue further by changing the resolution and refresh rate of the external display to see if it will be recognized better while in Studio Mode. You can refer to
 the chart on&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039635/connect-surface-to-a-tv-display-or-projector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></span>&nbsp;which shows the suggested display settings for Surface devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional troubleshooting steps that you can follow to resolve the display issue, open&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023496/surface-trouble-connecting-surface-to-a-second-screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 article</a></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the suggestions allow you to connect the Surface to an external display while in Studio Mode, consider using the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Instead of using a cable, the Surface will use Miracast to connect to the external display
 wirelessly. For more information about the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter, you can go&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023498/surface-using-the-microsoft-wireless-display-adapter-with-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post if you have other concerns. I'll be notified when you respond and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Ruz, the monitor I'm using is a Samsung S24D590. I haven't had any problems using it before this week. I typically use an external keyboard and mouse when my surface book is docked in Studio Mode.<br />
<br />
I've already gone through troubleshooting steps and ensured that my refresh rate is set correctly, as well as trying different resolutions. I've tested the monitor with other devices and found no issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 laptop running slow after installing Total Defense</h2>
                    The security software that came with my laptop expired.&nbsp; The place I bought my laptop gave me another security software program so I installed it no problem.&nbsp; Now I am having problems with apps and it is running very slow.&nbsp; I did not realize it was the
 security program until I tried system restore.&nbsp; After running that everything worked fine except it uninstalled my new security software so I reinstalled it then had the same problems again.&nbsp; I contacted the software maker and they seemed to take care of the
 problem but now they seem to be back again.&nbsp; Mainly it is apps running slow or other things taking a long time to run or open.&nbsp; I am sure it is due to the new security software.&nbsp; Should I contact the software maker about this again or do you think it is something
 else and if it is the program should I get another?&nbsp; I have a Toshiba Satellite Pro C855D.&nbsp; The security software is Total Defense.&nbsp; I have contacted this site many times

            Sorry I took so long to get back to you Bennet.&nbsp; Thanks for replying to my query.&nbsp; I am still experiencing the problem.&nbsp; I am running Total Defense v7.o&nbsp; which my windows compatablility&nbsp; service says is not compatable.&nbsp; What does that mean? is this the
 reason I am having these issues?&nbsp; When I contacted Total Defense why didn't they tell me?&nbsp; I also can't get windows defender to run.&nbsp; Do I need to?&nbsp; Is my computer still protected even with these issues?&nbsp; The main problem seems to be with ads.&nbsp; They take a
 long time to load when I'm on a certain site which makes it difficult to scroll until it loads.&nbsp; If the ad is constantly changing then I can't scroll at all.&nbsp; another problem is some apps won't run even though I had no problems with them before.&nbsp; I have music
 apps called JustaFan where the site will run but video wont play and music won't play.&nbsp; I am not to good with computers but I am learning.&nbsp; I would like t

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need not worry, weâ€™re here to help you with this issue. We will try to troubleshoot the issue one by one to avoid any confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Windows compatibility reports that the version you are using is incompatible, then that might be the reason you are facing these issue. In this case, I would suggest you to uninstall this application and use the built-in Windows defender. The Windows
 Defender offers real time protection and can protect your computer from all security threats. If you are not able to enable the Windows defender, then it might be conflicting with the existing security application. I would recommend uninstalling the current
 security software that you are using and then try enabling Windows defender. You can also check out these articles for more information on Windows Defender:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you were able to enable Windows defender after uninstalling the security applications. Once this is done, let us know if the other issue persists. We will troubleshoot them one by one.

<h2>            Cancelar renova&#231;&#227;o autom&#225;tica de EA Acess &#91;Cancel Automatic EA acess renewal &#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hoje recebi um email informando que a cobranÃ§a da renovaÃ§Ã£o anual automÃ¡tica do meu EA Acess nÃ£o foi realizada com sucesso (pois troquei de cartÃ£o de crÃ©dito).A questÃ£o Ã© que eu nem sabia que tinha renovaÃ§Ã£o automÃ¡tica, e muito menos queria realizar uma
 nova assinatura, atÃ© porque meu Xbox estÃ¡ com meu irmÃ£o e nem no Brasil eu estou.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quando fui entrar no site para cancelar esse pedido de assinatura, e tambÃ©m desativar a renovaÃ§Ã£o, nÃ£o me foi dada essa opÃ§Ã£o, dizendo que eu estou em ATRASO de pagamento, e que teria que realizar o pagamento (no valor de 109,90R$) para poder receber o dinheiro
 de volta, mas isso nÃ£o faz sentido algum. Ao invÃ©s de aproveitar que a compra nÃ£o foi realizada por falha na informaÃ§Ã£o do cartÃ£o e cancelar tudo, nÃ£o, querem que eu pague, para depois ser reembolsado. Tentei entrar em contacto, mas sÃ³ consegui achar aqui
 um meio de fazer a reclamaÃ§Ã£o.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aguardo alguma soluÃ§Ã£o lÃ³gica para isso! Att. Kaick Ribeiro</p>

</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Today I received an email stating that the collection of the automatic annual renewal of my EA acess was not performed successfully (because I switched credit card). The point is that I didn't even know I had automatic renewal, and
 much less wanted to make a new subscription, even because my Xbox is with my brother and not in Brazil I am.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I went to enter the site to cancel this subscription request, and also disable the renewal, I was not given this option, saying that I am in arrears of payment, and that would have to carry out the payment (worth 109, $90r) to be able to get
 the money back , but that doesn't make any sense. Instead of taking advantage that the purchase was not realized by failure in the card information and cancelling everything, no, they want me to pay, to be reimbursed. I tried to get in touch, but I could only
 find a way to make a complaint here.</strong></p>

<h2>            BSOD&#58; BCCode&#58; 1000007e</h2>
                    Hello, my computer i built earlier this year has been having the BSOD now for quite awhile, and I can't seem to find the fix.&nbsp;
<div>First off, here are my specs:</div>
<div>OS: windows 7</div>
<div>PSU:&nbsp;SeaSonic M12II 620 Bronze 620W ATX12V</div>
<div>CPU<span> </span>Intel Core i5-4670K 3.4GHz Quad-Core</div>
<div>Motherboard<span> </span>Asus Z87-PRO ATX LGA1150</div>
<div>Storage<span> </span>Samsung 840 Series 120GB 2.5" SSD</div>
<div>Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM</div>
<div>Video Card<span> </span>Gigabyte Radeon HD 7970 3GB</div>
<div>Memory &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I usually get the bsod while playing video games, however, often times instead of the bsod the game will crash and a bubble pops up saying "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered". this problem started after I caught my niece playing with
 the power button and the reset button on my case.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Troubleshooting I have done so far:</div>
<div>Update drivers</div>
<div>tested my harddrives</div>
<div>memtest 86 over two nights, no errors found</div>
<div>restored computer</div>
<div>uninstalled/reinstall windows.</div>
<div>swap gpus</div>
<div>monitor temperatures(everything normal)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure what else the problem could be, any ideas are greatly appreciated as this is really starting to frustrate me.</div>

We can see we have many Direct X MMS calls.<br />
<br />
<u><b>-------------------------------------------------------</b></u><br />
<br />
1. I can see in your loaded modules list you have various problematic Asus bloatware installed (Charger driver, etc). It's all bundled into the AI Suite. Please uninstall the Asus AI Suite ASAP.<br />
<br />
2. Remove and replace Norton with Microsoft Security Essentials for temporary troubleshooting purposes as Norton may be causing corruption:<br />

3. Do you have Asus Smartdoctor installed? <br />
<br />
<i><b>IOMap64.sys - Thu Feb 04 20:55:34 </b></i><b>2010</b><br />
<br />
^^ This is usually a driver associated with Smartdoctor. If you DO have it installed, remove it ASAP as it's very likely causing the Direct X MMS conflicts we are seeing. If you are using it, what were you using it for? Monitoring temps, voltages? I hope not
 overclocking.<br />
<br />
4. Ensure your SSD's firmware is 100% up to date via the manufacturers website.<br />

<i><b>If you're still crashing after all of my above recommendations, please enable Driver Verifier to see if we're dealing with any further device driver corruption:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
ãƒ»&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you receive any error message/code while playing the game?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, there is no information about the gameâ€™s compatibility with windows 8 as of now. I would recommend you to update the latest drivers from the game manufacturerâ€™s website and run the game in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=Links%2BGolf%2B2003%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=Links%2BGolf%2B2003%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to run in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Enter the Start screen</span></p>
<p><span>b) Press <b>Windows key + C</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you have a touch screen: Touch the right edge of your screen and slide your finger to the center of the screen to show the Charms bar)</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for <b>Troubleshooting,</b> Click<b> Settings</b> in the right column.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <b>Troubleshooting.</b> Click<b> Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b></span></p>
<p><span>e) Click <b>next,</b> select<b> Not Listed. </b>Click <b>Next</b></span></p>
<p><span>f) Click <b>Browse</b> and select the Driver file that you downloaded.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <b>next,</b> click <b>Troubleshoot program</b></span></p>
<p><span>h) Check <b>The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now</b> box</span></p>
<p><span>i) Click <b>next, </b>select the last known working operating system for this driver
</span></p>
<p><span>j) Click <b>Next</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the display drivers from the device manager and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps provided below to update the drivers:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Drag the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the â€˜<b>Start iconâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select â€˜<b>Device managerâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click on the <b>â€˜Display adapterâ€™</b> and click on <b>â€˜Update driver softwareâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then follow the next method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Uninstall and reinstall the display drivers in compatibility mode if the windows 8 drivers are not available:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Press <b>Windows Key + R,</b> type<b>devmgmt.msc</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Expand the <b>graphic card</b>, click on the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on <b>properties</b>, click on<b> uninstall</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Right-click on the driver (Downloaded from the manufacturerâ€™s website) file.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click on <b>Properties</b> and select the<b> Compatibility</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Click the <b>checkbox</b> before Run this program in Compatibility mode for option and select Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>h. In the list-down box; then try installing the device driver via Run as administrator</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also Refer:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Updates for Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliadlf-ny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates for Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016</h2>
                    <p>I checked my Update history today and noticed that an Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 Failed. Not sure why that happened and it is trying to download the Build again. I checked the Microsoft site and noticed that there is a long list of&nbsp;Version 1607 and
 Windows Server 2016 Builds that never installed or at least my history shows they weren't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be causing all those 1607 Builds from not updating/installing (no indication they failed to install) and why now is Version 1703 trying to download and will it keep failing? I've got my computer on automatic update. Confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, this issue is caused by corrupted system files. For us to install the available updates on your computer, we suggest that you run the troubleshooter for Windows update. Check this article on how to download and run the

<p>Gerard: I did the troubleshooting step and it came back that it fixed something. Not sure what it fixed since it doesn't tell me that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read the link that Donna provided and my laptop&nbsp; is compatible so that is not going to be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm thinking correctly, it would seem I should have had the 1607 Builds installed prior to the 1703, right?</p>
<p>That is a big list of 1607 updates/builds, so is there any easy and quick way to get them all installed like they should have been able to before?</p>

<p>Donna: Okay, this is what shows on the second run of the Troubleshooter as fixed so I assume this is what was possibly causing Build 1607 from installing or was this something we had to initiate ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also checked to be sure I'm on the latest build for 1511. I'll look at the link you gave and see if I can get the 1607 done but I did notice this morning that Windows Update shows that 1703 is downloading again since early this morning. I'm on DSL for
 internet so it takes a long time to download large files. </p>

<h2>            Flight Simulator 98 Problems</h2>
                    I have flight simulator 98 that i loaded on my new Dell computer with vista. My logitech joystick will not work with it, it will calibrate but will do nothing else. How do i get it to work? It worked fine with my old computer that had xp on it. It says
 that it is enabled but will not work.

<p><span>Hey,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />

In addition to Kevin J Baird's thought, I would like to suggest the below steps:</span>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>It seems that the driver for Joystick is not updated for windows Vista.</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does joystick work fine on other games in Windows Vista?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step1:<br />
<br />
1. Access the link below to fix game controller issue on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Here is a link to troubleshoot game controller problems:</span></p>
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831361</a>
</span>
<p><strong>Step2:</strong> <br />
<br />
<span>Try installing the game in Windows XP compatibility mode and check if it works.</span></p>

    <title>Since the recent connectivity issues one contact appears constantly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _moog_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since the recent connectivity issues one contact appears constantly offline to me, also I can see their messages but they cannot see mine.</h2>
                    <p>This is happening ever since the recent connectivity issues that hit Skype a few days ago. It happens the same with my account on the two devices I use it on, namely Mac and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to this contact who said their status is actually set to 'Away' and not 'Offline' or 'Invisible', also I have not been blocked by them etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see their messages, but they cannot see mine. Nor can they see any files I send, but I can see theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test I created a group and invited just them. They did not get the invite. But then they invited me to a group and I received that invite and joined. In this group they still appeared offline to me, however they could see my messages and files! This
 was great, at least we could talk. But today this same group seems to only work in part, the other person can only see a new message from me if they completely restart Skype each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, thank you.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem with two contacts I communicate with regularly. This happens in the Windows 10 UWP app, the Mac desktop app, and the Android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the contacts lets me know around 17:00 every day that my messages to him have finally delivered. Not sure if my messages have ever got through to the other contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*EDIT: I should add that Skype says the messages are sent, though they are clearly not delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I think about it, these are two of the contacts I tried to message during the outage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a weird one: I am in a group chat that includes these two contacts, and when I send messages through the group, they receive them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the other contacts I communicate with regularly (10+), there doesn't seem to be any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was one other contact I messaged during the outage, but I also sent him a test message via Android around that time which did get delivered, and I have no problem sending messages to him now.<br />

<p>I would just like to add that I have now checked this out with the same account on Skype for Windows as well and the same problem persists. Therefore I would surmise that it is not a client issue requiring some sort of local purging of logs/ cache etc. It
 appears to be something that got broken server-side during the outage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can be fixed asap, it's making Skype unusable for me and many others.</p>

<p>I've had this problem for several days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two contacts with whom I have daily contact with can not see my online, yet they can receive my messages. In return I can see them as online, but I can not receive their messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In group chat it is no better. Yet I am able to be invited to a group VOIP call just fine, even though I look offline to these people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried iOS, Mac, Web and now MS Edge and they're all exactly the same - I also tried iOS over 4G instead of my wifi but no dice there either. Had it been just Mac or iOS I'd have understood the issue could be related to my wifi settings, or location
 (Australia) via 4G, but as it also happens on Skype Web it leads me to think it's a more fundamental issue with Skype itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great way to get out of work with people, but I'm otherwise going nuts here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exact same problems here. Hardcore user of Skype for work. I can send messages but they don't get delivered/or don't show on the recepients side. I do receive their messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just after a major bug fix (memory leak) that was an issue for a couple of months on a late 2016 Macbook pro with touchbar. OS 10.12.5 and the latest available version of Skype. It started when Skype was having serious issues last week. Also my video
 still keeps freezing during long calls, but that's another topic ...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers,<br />
troubleshooting, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Double check<br />
for Windows 10 compatibility.</p>
=====================================================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X&nbsp; OR&nbsp; place the mouse in the lower left corner and Right Click - Command Prompt (ADMIN)<br />
<br />
Enter the below (or COPY and PASTE ) :<br />
<br />
<span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001

<br />
See if that troubleshooter helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Control Panel - Device Manager - DVD-CD drivers -&nbsp;Right Click the drive -<br />

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/
</span></a><br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on <br />
another computer&nbsp;since your's will not start - XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1 , or 10<br />
or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with <br />
another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS though do not use&nbsp;it to try to ANY&nbsp;repairs <br />
unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just <br />
boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 DVD boot<br />
disc&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) -<br />
<br />
Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or ry booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

            <p>OlÃ¡ robertlourenzo,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Conforme mencionado em seu post anterior (https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/58d9c86b-687b-44c5-afca-46efe7358e43), uma vez que vocÃª Ã© um membro da US Rewards, nÃ£o premiamos compras em empresas nÃ£o- USD.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>AlÃ©m disso, O seu depÃ³sito estÃ¡ a ser impedido devido a uma incompatibilidade entre as suas recompensas Conta regiÃ£o e sua regiÃ£o de Conta Microsoft. Desde suas recompensas conta Ã© uma entidade separada da sua Conta Microsoft, migrando sua regiÃ£o de Conta Microsoft tambÃ©m nÃ£o vai mudar suas recompensas Conta regiÃ£o. Portanto, quando sua conta Recompensas tenta um depÃ³sito em uma moeda regional, nÃ£o pode concluir quando sua conta da Microsoft Ã© de uma moeda diferente. Sua Conta Recompensas Ã© dos Estados Unidos e sua conta da Microsoft Ã© brasileiro.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>No entanto, este problema pode ser corrigido de ir para a pÃ¡gina do Microsoft Commerce em (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) para atualizar sua conta Microsoft para combinar com seu Xbox Live Recompensas localizaÃ§Ã£o. Outra opÃ§Ã£o se vocÃª deseja continuar com recompensas em sua regiÃ£o atual Xbox Live Ã© a optar por sair do programa em (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/</a>), espere 48 horas e, em seguida, assinar novamente para cima, o que pode tambÃ©m levar 48 horas.
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Enquanto vocÃª vai perder o seu progresso, iniciando uma nova conta, vocÃª pode comeÃ§ar a ganhar prÃªmios CrÃ©ditos que vai premiar com Ãªxito a sua moeda regional recÃ©m-registrado. Para confirmar que vocÃª tem re-registrado corretamente, vocÃª pode verificar a sua juntar-se a data a partir da pÃ¡gina MyRewards em (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). Se a sua data se juntar mostra uma data especÃ­fica e nÃ£o uma data de "???", entÃ£o a sua conta com Ãªxito foi re-registrado. Se vocÃª abrir uma nova mensagem depois de ser capaz de fazer login em sua conta novas recompensas, vocÃª pode solicitar quaisquer depÃ³sitos pendentes da sua conta antiga para a nova.</p>

<p>If it is compatibility issue then right click on gta_sa.exe or gta.exe then select

<h2>            MW3 names&#47;clan tags with controller buttons in.</h2>
                    
<p><em>If this has already been asked apologies but I couldn't find anything about it.<br />
<br />
Playing today I noticed a lot of people had button symbols in their names/tags, I remember this happening early on in MW2 MP (modding). Is it the same for MW3 or is this some other exploit people are using?.<br />
<br />
Cheers for your time.</em></p>

<p>There are several vids on youtube showing you how to do this. Unlike MW2, you don't use any j-tags, mods, USB hacks or system tampering. All that is used is the onscreen keyboard.
</p>
<p>The reason people got banned for this in the past is because it required you to use system tampering/modding to achieve it, but now there isn't any reason why people would get a ban for doing it in MW3.....though i wouldn't recommend it as i can't find any
 official posts or response giving a solid yes or no.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed by IW that they are dealing with this and that it is an exploit and can be reported as such. And there are now rumours that people are getting banned as well.</p>
<p>Also read here, this is code of conduct</p>
<p>Modding the Clan Tag by Glitch is going to get you banned look at:</p>
<p>14 - My LIVE account was suspended</p>
<p>These modifications may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; Altering the appearance of your Gamertag or avatar outside of the default parameters</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; Illegitimate gain of achievements or avatar awards</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; Application of watermarks or other special identifiers that were not legitimately granted</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; Unauthorized manipulation of in-game parameters</p>
<p>So don't do it is the bottom line, and you look like an idiot with all that rubbish and pee off other people because yr tags fill up half the screen</p>

<p>And in fact looking at the account suspension forum there are now a stack of threads about this:</p>
<p>Altering the appearance of your Gamertag or avatar outside of the default parameters</p>
<p>And they all have one thing in common, they have played MW3 and they are getting permanantly banned</p>

<p><em>Cheers for clearing this up peeps :).<br />
I'm glad to hear something is being done about it because I find these button symbols all over the screen really distracting. Makes me even worse at MP which is something I don't need any help with :P.<br />

Thanks again.</em></p>

<h2>            I&#39;m getting Windows Store error 0xc002001b when I try to install any application</h2>
                    I've had my laptop for a few months now and have been able to download apps from the windows store without issue, until now. Every time I try to install any windows store application I get error code 0xc002001b. I tried troubleshooting my device, and the
 windows app store troubleshooter application. I refreshed the store cache. I installed the latest windows update, and my date/time/location are all correct. Basically, if it's on google, I tried it. I have not "refreshed" my computer, however, and would like
 to avoid doing this since I have many applications I don't want to go through the hassle of installing again.&nbsp;

            <p>I am having same problem 3 years later. I have had my computer for almost 2 years and have had windows 10 on it since the beta version. It says it is updated to newest version.
</p>
<p>But on Oct 10 I installed updates and I have not been able to install updates or apps since it gets stuck in the ACQUIRING LICESNSE. and will go no further. gives me error message 0xC002001B.</p>
<p>I have been trying to install an app for 4 days now and am getting mad that I can not.
</p>
<p>I have run the fix and it has not worked. I have about 10 apps that need updating and it will not let any of them update. The only solution I have not tried is creating new account. How is that really going to work when it would be a secondary account and
 I am on the administrator account and can't do anything. I am very upset.</p>

<p>You will talk via keyboard to someone god knows where in the world.</p>
<p>Then, make it very clear that you want your problem answered</p>
<p>In other words don't disconnect </p>
<p>Then allow yourself between 2 to 3 hours</p>
<p>and, amazingly enough, as in my case the problem was solved.</p>
<p>My person said "I assure you I will not leave until I have solved your problem"</p>
<p>and he did from Central America, I think</p>

    <title>Open zipped files from Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Open zipped files from Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I recently completed school projects in Word 2007, however I completed them using the wrong program which caused them to appear in Word Pad which was unacceptable.&nbsp; I went back in and changed the format and zipped the files together.&nbsp; Now, when I attempted
 to open the zipped file, I get an error message that the file cannot be open because there are problems with the contents, I then click the "OK" button and get another message that word found unreadable content in the file. I am not that computer literate,
 but I am assuming that there has been some type of corruption.&nbsp; Am I correct and if so, can this problem be fixed and how?</p>

            As you said, I think that you saved your school projects in a format that can be read by Word Pad. If it right, open your original file (the file that can opened by Word Pad) by Word (right click the file and select Open With, then choose Word from the
 list). Use Word to edit and save the file to a word file format (Save as function). And .zip files cannot be opened by Word, but Windows. Hope this help.

<p>No, that's not the problem. Word can not read a zip file (in general,<br />
<strong>no</strong> application can read a zip file).</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>What program did you complete the projects in?</p>
<p>What was the extension of the files that program created?</p>
<p>You say "I went back in and changed the format." What did you go back<br />
into? What format did you change them to?</p>

<p>Hey there, FaintCalf187156</p>
<p>If the Xbox Live Enforcement team said you can have your original gamertag back, then this could take time for them to update your Xbox Live gamertag again. We on these forums have no contact with the Xbox Live Enforcement team, so we can't really help in
 that respect. </p>
<p>I would recommend waiting for 24 to 48 hours and try again. If you continue to have problems, then please reply back and I will try my best to escalate this the best way I can for you.
</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

<p>Hi there. It's been a while since visiting these pages. However I used to spend a lot of time dealing with account issues and guiding people to the enforcement team with all sorts of "problems" like this. Unless they have changed things and are more relaxed
 now I very much doubt you will be able to use that particular gamertag again. The enforcement team do not simply hand out gamertag violation changes willy nilly... They investigate every report brought against an account and if that report is valid they act.</p>
<p>Xbox support will not be of any help as they do not have the authority to deal with these cases. All they can do and what they should do is prompt you to speak with the Enforcement team.</p>
