    <title>Adding pages in Fax and Scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a22pom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding pages in Fax and Scan</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>In Windows XP I used WINFAX Pro and was able to print various items, mainly CAD drawings, directly to it and each new print was added to tthe same single fax.&nbsp; With the Fax &amp; Scan program each new print opens up a completely new fax with header etc.</p>
<p>The reason for faxing in this manner is that my cad drawings come out cleanly the other end, much better that sending via a fax machine.</p>
<p>Is there a way of adding extra printed pages to one single fax?</p>
<p>Best Rgds</p>

<p><span>Windows Fax and Scan doesn’t have the option of adding extra printed pages to one single fax. You may have

    <title>Need help getting files back and corruption issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cofeeiv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help getting files back and corruption issue</h2>
                    <p>I tried updating from 8.1 to 10. After I rebooted the computer, my desktop icons/shortcuts/files were missing, as well as my background, so I thought my update was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to figure out where my desktop was, I found instructions (on this site from support) on how to put&nbsp; everything back, which seemed to work. Then I realized I did not have Windows 10, after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reset the computer to an earlier date, which did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files &amp; settings were not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details: System restore failed to extract the original copy of the directory from the restore point.</p>
<p>Source: %Program Files%\WindowsApps</p>
<p>Destination: Appx Staging</p>
<p>An unspecified error occurred during System Restore (0x80070017)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try System Restore again &amp; choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try an advanced recovery method."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try a different restore point and received the same error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I called support, who told me to run a scan as administrator, which gave me the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log For example C:\widows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline service scenarios."</p>
<p>
</p><p>During that support call, the tech disconnected our call, so I have just gotten off the phone with yet another support person, who was of no help at all. Please help me with two issues: Fix corruption and restore files. I want to update to Windows 10, but
 am not comfortable doing so until these issues are resolved.</p>

    <title>When I return to my computer after being away it says &#39;locked&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> senorjax  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I return to my computer after being away it says &#39;locked&#39; under my username. And I think once i logout it keeps me from logging back on.</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; I searched but couldn't find my exact problem in any open threads so I guess I'll have to post a&nbsp; new one.&nbsp; We just last weeek purchased a Dell xps 8000 with Windows 7 installed.&nbsp; Some nice features but also it's share of bugs, such as random freezes.&nbsp;
 And this one;&nbsp; the second day I noticed the word 'locked' next to my username.&nbsp; I am an administrator, if that matters.&nbsp; Some time later I logged out and at my next login I got the error message "User Profile Service service failed the logon".&nbsp; The end result
 was that a Dell tech. did a system restore, which got me back up and running.&nbsp; I didn't log off last night and when I first looked at my screen this morning it says 'locked' again by my username. I am working with no problems now but I'm scared to logoff.&nbsp;
 Why is this happening and what can I do to fix it?&nbsp; Thanks

            I think I'm ok.&nbsp; For now.&nbsp; Not sure why this worked but I checked the box so it asks me to login after i return from screen saver mode.&nbsp; After a couple cycles I removed the check and the "locked" notice is gone.&nbsp; No need to reply, thanks for the help,
 if it returns I will be back.&nbsp; And fyi I have surge protection and power conditioning both in my AC system.

<h3> mike-edsel6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Tablet - Irulu</h2>
                    Just purchased an Irulu 8.5" Tablet for reading going from a Nook tablet so I could&nbsp;install Kindle and Kobo. I installed the Kindle app from the Microsoft store. App other than a basic reading app is difficult to navigate. Reading with the table horizontal
 - (longwise) is no problem - when you turn in the other way (longway up) the reading pane shrinks to about 2 inches in the center of the screen from top to bottom. I know it is an&nbsp;app issue because both Nook and Kobo work with no problem.&nbsp;Tried to uninstall
 and reinstall to no&nbsp;avail. Anyone else have this issue and possibly have a fix. &nbsp;

            <p>Thanx for your response.</p>
<p>Email is thru my isp using Yahoo Mail, tho' I preferred to use Win Live Mail 2011 until recently upgrading to 2012 thru' Live Essentials.</p>
<p>Prior to that I updated from Win 7 to Win 10 and tried the Mail app - mail lags by at least a day sometimes 2, whilst folders are empty with a qualification 'not synced yet'. I'm presuming the folder info is coming from the isp not Win Live Mail.</p>
<p>I now find whilst my printer prints with everything except the Mail app.</p>
<p>I've tried the web for answers to no avail, confusion reigns and gmail is fast beckoning - I just want a simple system that WORKS across all devices.........AlfieBird</p>

            <p>Ankit,</p>
<p>Thank you: it is 2159.CST here, just hooked up a new HP Officejet PRO 8630 eAIO printer, amazed at how much better the making of wireless connections is going, but with cartridge carriages and the back 'duplexer' missing -- maybe in another shipment have
 gotten three so far I am using this as an excuse to stop working early, have dinner and take some weight off my right leg and hip which is killing me.</p>
<p>Will read the cited article and get back to you.</p>
<p>BTW - the initial write-up on the choices, of burning a DVD, working with an .ISO image, or dedicating a USB drive which could be recycled and updated certainly make it sound attractive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I am re-thinking and reconsidering reformatting the SanDisk 64GB Ultra USB to NTFS: are there any reasons not to do so if the USB drive will be used for the Stand-Alone tool of mssstool64.exe?</p>
<p>

            I have sent Microsoft &nbsp;multiple messages and recieved nothing back i am getting very agitated with them over this whole situation. I called the support line and their only suggestion was to post in the forum and send them a message. They offer these prizes
 and dont follow up with them, this issue needs to be resolved for me yo maintain intrest in microsoft and xbox as a whole.

<h2>            Windows Installer Cannot Be Accessed</h2>
                    For a week now my windows installer has gone berserk and whenever i try to install or uninstall programs i get the following error "The windows installer service could not be accessed. This can occur if the windows installer is not correctly installed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even more annoying is the fact that I've discovered that Windows Photo Gallery, Media Player, and Adobe Reader aren't working anymore nor does Windows Update work and i keep getting error code 641.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already tried over 6 different solutions &nbsp;from&nbsp;<span>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER to making sure Windows Installer was on start and was running on&nbsp;manual, and checking the&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>msiexec folder with no results.&nbsp;</span></div>

            <p>If the above info does not help, see if you can just 'rollback' the driver for the network adaptor from Device Manager in control panel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager and find the network adaptor, right-click it and click properties. On the [Driver] tab click the [rollback driver] button. You will need to be in an admin account to roll the driver back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF that works, the driver will likely re-appear in your updates list, so hide it.</p>

<h2>            Missing letters when typing online.</h2>
                    I go online and start typing a question or a answer to one, and I get a problem with missing letters&nbsp; KEYS&nbsp; while typing. But whe I'm using outlook express I don't have the problem. It is only happens when I type in letters or on a forum. I have tried
 to revert the computer, defrag, Microsoft quick fix, I have a Desk top computer and I have bought several keyboards thinking that was the cause. The computer is a HP Pavilivon NB dv9700, I'm using for internet cable RoadRunner.

<h3> johnlin33  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do  remove the advertisements from the games I downloaded&#63; The ads cover a lot of the screen and sometimes in the card games I cannot even see the bottom of the rows</h2>
                    I downloaded solitaire, spider solitaire, hearts, and a few others but when I want to play an ad (such as for Bing) appears at the bottom of the page but I don't know how to remove it.

<h2>            How to get rid of McAfee pop up &#40; after un-installation&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am in desperate need of some help. I had an issue w McAfee pop-up so I un-installed the service that came pre-loaded w my dell ( Windows 10) laptop. However, it contiues to pop up "reminding me" to run the service. The icon appears in the task bar
 and everything. If I click on it, nothing happens or opens but it annoyingly pops up everytime I'm on. Plz help :'(</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Now that I'm thinking about it, Idk if there ever was a McAfee service on the pc. It was brand new in Dec. Noone owned it before me. I think it just started to pop up seemingly out of no where...</p>

            Go to McAfee and get their uninstalling software and it will remove all of the code.&nbsp; If you used Programs and Features to uninstall you did not get rid of the bad code that Windows 10 does not like.

<h2>            Easy Anti Cheat &#40;EAC&#41; &#34;Windows Kernel Modification Detected&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to play any game running Easy Anti Cheat (EAC), I have a legitimate version of Windows 10 Home reinstalled TWICE and bought a key. I updated to the latest version of Windows that released today and I'm still having the same. This is literal game-breaking
 and high severity issue since I can't launch or play any game running Easy Anti Cheat (EAC). I've opened two support tickets with Easy Anti Cheat (EAC) and I've got absolutely no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help.</p>
<p>

            Easy Anti Cheat is on the Steam Store and is used by other third parties such as Epic Games and FACEIT, so I don't think it is&nbsp; virus.

    <title>NBA 2k17 CORRUPTED FILE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freshicebear  say:</h3>
<h2>            NBA 2k17 CORRUPTED FILE</h2>
                    I play myteam on NBA2k17 except I cannot access the game on my account. It says "user data corrupted" Other accounts work and my account works on other Xbox ones. When I get on the game it says it is syncing the data, but it still says the data is corrupted.
 I've tried deleting and reinstalling the game and deleting my account off my Xbox and redownloading it and nothing works. Please help.
                </div>

<p>When you removed the game, did you remove the save file that is stored locally on the Xbox? If so, it sounds like the save file might actually be corrupted on the cloud server that is syncing with your profile. If that is the case, unfortunately you will
 have to remove the save file from both the cloud server and your Xbox. This will however cause you to have to restart in your game.</p>
<p>How to remove both the cloud save and local save:</p>
<p>1. Go to you My Games &amp; Apps</p>
<p>2. Find NBA2k17 and press the menu button and select manage game</p>
<p>3. Go to the save data, press the menu button witht he save data selected and hit Delete.</p>
<p>4. A window will pop-up asking if you want to delete everywhere or just from the console, select everywhere. This will remove all saved data from the cloud as well as the console.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I have three computers running windows 8 pro all three have the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caused by windows updates..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last set of windows update also caused outlook 2013 problems and had to do system restore to fix it and Microsoft pulled the update due to all the&nbsp; problems.&nbsp;They fixed it and put back on &nbsp;two days later&nbsp;and resolved there problem with&nbsp;Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They pulled the Microsoft FIXIT tool or Patch that would solve the problem.&nbsp; I can find the tool but is no longer working .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They need to fix it and put back on to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;They refuse to fix this one that Everybody has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<br />What is your purpose ?
<br />Windows to go is made for USB drives, so why do you want to install it on a HD ?

            Does the USB include the Enterprise Edition?
<br />Does you laptop have Enterprise Edition already installed for the Windows version you have on it?
<br />
<br />Did you read the tutorials on installing the software?

            Hi timmaddox,
<br />
<br />My name is Roger W, an independent advisor trying to help. Its look like that you need to replace the HD, but first, apply an  "HD Checking":
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/hd-checking-how-to-test-yours/588b34ee-211b-4747-9a92-ee106090cbbf?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If definitely, you need to replace it, follow the next guide page, 54:

            Hi,  timmaddox 
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend checking the Hard Disk and Ram Memory
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “chkdsk /f /r X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.
