<p>You will find details of the lifecycle support for Windows XP at<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-gb&amp;C2=1173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-gb&amp;C2=1173</a> and at<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/#ServicePackSupport." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/#ServicePackSupport.</a></p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that any competent computer<br />
manufacturer would say that you 'DO NOT need to download any<br />
updates regular or security updates'.&nbsp; Did you speak to someone<br />
in the manufacturer's call centre?&nbsp; If so, the advice you<br />
received was absolute rubbish.</p>
<p>Service Pack 3 was released in June 2008.&nbsp; Since then Microsoft<br />
have released many critical and security updates - which address<br />
threats and other problems that have been discovered since 2008.</p>
<p>It is most important to turn on Automatic Updates.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, you MUST download and install all critical updates without delay.&nbsp; I hope this advice is not too late, because some Malware interferes with the automatic update function.</p>
<p>Open Control Panel and double click on Security Center. The<br />
resulting menu offers the following options:</p>
<p>Option 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn off automatic updates. - Definitely NOT<br />
recommended</p>
<p>Option 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Notify me, but don't download or install them. - Not<br />
ideal, but might be appropriate, if you have a very slow<br />
connection to the Internet.&nbsp; This option allows you to choose<br />
which updates to download and when.&nbsp; Consequently, you can<br />
download and install updates, when you are not using your<br />
computer for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Option 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Download updates, but let me choose when to install<br />
them. - That is my personal preference, because I want to be in<br />
control of any changes to my computer.&nbsp; Incidentally, I have just<br />
received a pop-up notification that Updates are ready for my<br />
computer.&nbsp; I am about to click on the yellow shield icon to<br />
install this month's critical updates.</p>
<p>Option 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Automatically download recommended updates for my<br />
computer and install them.&nbsp; -&nbsp; That is Microsoft's<br />
recommendation.</p>
<p>You should select from Option 3 or Option 4.</p>
<p>Once you ensured that automatic updates are turned on, use your browser to<br />
visit the URL at<br />
<a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us.</a><br />
This will enable you to perform an immediate one-off search for<br />
updates (without waiting for the next automatic update).</p>
<p>The express option searches for critical updates.&nbsp; The custom<br />
option will also include additional updates that you might, or<br />
might not want to install.&nbsp; From the optional updates list, I<br />
always install root certificate updates - but I avoid hardware<br />
drivers (because it is better to download updated drivers from<br />
the hardware manufacturer's website).</p>

<h2>            Accidental purchase in marketplace.</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft, I have a bit of a problem concerning a purchase that was made on 1/8/14. The purchase made was Bioshock 1. Unfortunately, the purchase was not made by me, it was made by my younger cousin. I was not home at the time so I couldn't prevent
 it. I really didn't need to download this game considering I already have the game and have had it for a while. I was wondering if I could get a refund ($4.99) for the game if it is possible?

<p>If the purchase was made without your consent or knowledge, then there is a slight possibility that you can get a refund for the 4.99 purchase. If you have no prior refunds for the year, then you may be eligible for a refund, or, on the other hand, if you
 already have had a refund this year, you can contest the purchase because it is considered an unauthorized charge on your account. To know for sure, you would have to get in touch with Xbox customer support, who can go in and take a look for you, and potentially
 get everything sorted out. The number for support is 1-800-469-9269 if your in the US, Canada or Puerto Rico. Good luck!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">He won't get a refund. The purchase was made with his account on his console. There was no unauthorized access involved. He left his account unprotected and his cousin used it. His issue is with his cousin. Tell your cousin you
 want your $5.00 back. Then put a pass code on your account to prevent any unauthorized access to it. Create a guest account on your console for your cousin to use or tell him to create his own, if he wants a Gold account then tell him he'll have to pay for
 it himself. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are all sorts of things that can be done to prevent other people in your home from using your account when you are not there. You just need to make the effort.

<p>In actuality, because the charge was made without his authorization, it could be considered fraudulent charges, which means that Yes, a refund could be negotiated, though typically in the case of fraudulent charges, that must be taken up with your bank.
</p>
<p>Also, as I said, you get one free, no questions asked refund for the year that he could apply for. Once again, he would just have to take it up with Customer Support.</p>

<p>TenthStreetRed -- Microsoft's policy is no refunds and suggesting otherwise is inappropriate. &nbsp;This incident does not amount to fraud because there was no criminal activity performed. &nbsp;His account was accessed on his console, no password was circumvented,
 no lies were told... no fraud was committed.</p>

    <title>Dell Desktop will not wake after sleep command - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dell Desktop will not wake after sleep command</h2>
                    <p>The posting is a follow-up to my previous post of a couple days ago. I decided to start from scratch with trying to troubleshoot this problem.</p>
<p>Inspiron 580 running Windows7</p>
<p>Intel Graphics and Media</p>
<p>ST2010 Monitor</p>
<p>When I put the computer to sleep (windows orb&gt;sleep), the monitor goes into power saver mode (as expected); the screen goes black and the power button glows amber. The system unit fans go nearly silent and the power button glows amber. When I later wake
 the computer by pressing any key on the keyboard, the system unit fans spin a bit louder and the power button glows white. The monitor lights up briefly and displays the message "Entering Power Saver Mode" and the screen immediately goes black. The power button
 once again glows amber. If I press the power button, it repeats the same behavior just described. The only way I've found to get the monitor back is to re-boot. (shaking/clicking the mouse does nothing to either the system unit nor the monitor. I haven't tried
 throwing the mouse on the floor, nor the monitor for that matter)</p>
<p>I'm using the DELL pre-defined Power Plan with no changes. It shows no setting/option describing how the monitor might or&nbsp; persuaded to come out of power saver mode or not to. And the Device Manager Properties display for the st2010 has no Power Management
 tab.The device manager driver dialog says the driver is up to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it&nbsp;conceivable that&nbsp;the st2010 is not capable of accepting a POWER UP command from the system? I wonder if there is a mode in which it will respond to special key sequences from the keyboard?</p>
<p>TIA,</p>
<p>Phil<br />

            <p>The problem is caused by having an old usb printer, hp psc2210, that interferes with win7 Power Management. I don't have any formal documentation but have determined this experimentally, booting with various combinations of attached devices and trying the
 sleep command. The problem did not pop up initially because the printer was attached to another (XP) computer on the network. When I stopped using the XP computer I attached the printer directly to the win7 computer instead of accessing it over the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that there are no good tools to diagnose this kind of problem. Seem windows ought to be able to report the power-management-worthiness of all devices and raise a flag when a device like this printer is attached. Actually, the data may be
 there but I just did not interpret it correctly. If I drill down to the Power data property of the device in Device Manager, it shows the current power state of D0, which equates to S0, which probably means something significant.</p>
<p>Even so, I don't understand why an unsupported device would interfere with WAKE unless it's being asked to WAKE the computer. In my case, it's not the printer that is being asked to WAKE.&nbsp;Furthermore, &nbsp;it's the monitor, not that printer, that is failing
 to WAKE...everything else -- hard drive, etc -- all&nbsp;wake OK.<br />
</p>
<p>I'll just have to be careful to leave the printer unattached whenever it's not actually in use, especially when there is the risk of the computer entering SLEEP automatically. Not very convenient. Time for a new printer!!</p>

<h2>            Xbox...xCloud&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dear friends, community, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss xCloud!</p>
<ul>
<li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What do you know? (Please post it, we don’t want to link chase :))</li><li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Why are you interested?!?! (Are you reading Microsoft?)</li><li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Any questions for others?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Well…I am so excited for xCloud myself! It is the new cloud streaming “Netflix for games” as Microsoft says. So far as I know the game pass is available on there and you don’t download anything…I think you just stream it to a program that you download once.
 This game streaming service is supposed to come to public testing this year for release next year! As matter of fact, I think they are already doing the public trials right this minute. They will use the Azure servers to ensure the fastest speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Now, of course, I am interested because I love streaming services but this one is unique as unlike others you will supposedly be able to play all of your Xbox One games on it! This would be a big help for the library of 80 games. I have 1GBPs fiber internet
 so I can definitely handle this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Now I wonder if anyone can clear a few things up for me…Has anyone tested it to tell me about it; I am very interested? How much do you pay for the service? And finally, I wonder if someone could tell me this…How can one get into the beta?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Discuss!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now, this is one of the issues that Microsoft is pushing. They are trying to say we should use it on our mobile phones. I don't really see how we are supposed to do this our unlimited plans have speed limitations of 25GB usually. Also; even more surprisingly&nbsp;most
 home internet in America has bandwidth&nbsp;limitation of 1TB a month. Mine has unlimited since it is Fiber but I do not have an unlimited&nbsp;cell plan to do this on. They are really going have to optimize this service at home for it to work!</p>

<p>Somewhat interested. I look at some of Europe and North America's internet speeds and the download is in excess of 300mb/s and then where I live it drops to 80mb/s (in off peak). All of these ideas are great, I love innovation but sometimes it is just not
 possible to roll it out to everyone which could be detrimental to their PR and marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to Xbox Achievements on portable devices like what's speculated is going to happen to Nintendo Switch! Depending how that turns out a Switch will be a must buy for me, even when I'm already looking at it (1 hour train rides for work and
 uni suck).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the note of portability, if I could stream Xbox games such as Assassins Creed or Red Dead Redemption to a portable device that would be amazing, I'd even settle for older Xbox 360 titles like Battlefield Bad Company or Assassins Creed. But the processing
 power for that on a portable device will be a while away. GTA Andreas and III are on the iPhone so we could be a few years away from seeing some Xbox 360 titles on a portable device. Maybe xCould could help this, I'm not sure on the technical side of things
 and how practical they are.<br />
</p>
<p>I'd like the add the Rocket League and Minecraft cross play is absolutely amazing, I hope xCloud can improve on this somehow. You can see how Xbox is gaining ground to become some huge service, publisher and hardware maker, I'm loving it.</p>

            I'm curious how stable this service would prove to be. Does anyone remember the gaming service called OnLive that closed down back in 2015? I'm honestly skeptical of if I would buy into this.

<h2>            Error 38 Windows 10 USB DVD</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Home 1809 OS Build 17763.253&nbsp; with all appropriate KB's but my USB DVD constantly causes Device Manager to show an alert 38 which I've seen earlier on this Forum. No amount of uninstalling and allowing Windows to re-install drivers

            Hi Matthew,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The best way to unlink your device is to create a new local account, make it administrator, copy the stuff over you like and then delete the Microsoft account.

<br />Make sure to change the type as administrator.

<h2>            Audible clicking sound when selecting folders in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    I am using MS Office 2010, and every time I click on any folder, there is a barely perceptible sound, which was not there before, and is very annoying. I have not found a way to make it go away,&nbsp; but would like to do so. This computer was hit by a virus
 about a month ago, and I have been able to restore everything else, but this noise is new, and I can't seem to find a way to make it stop. Any ideas?

<h2>            Program can&#39;t start because MSVCR71.dll is missing</h2>
                    Hello people,<br />
<br />
Got the following error code when trying to load areca - backup software. <br />
"The program can't start because MSVCR71.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem".<br />
<br />
I did do a quick search, found some people hosting the DLL files but not happy to take off an old source, and saw a solution on here to use regsvr32 msvcr71.dll but that returns "The module msvcr71.dll failed to load. Make sure the binary is stored at the specified
 path..." - I've searched sys32&nbsp; and the DLL is not there.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Ian<br />

            <div>Hi Kathy,</div>
<div><br />
It looks like you get an error message prompting “<strong>Files needed to display video are not installed or are not working correctly. Restart Media center or computer</strong>” while playing recorded TV shows on the Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
I would like to gather some information to help you better:<br />
1) Is this issue specific for any particular recorded TV show?</div>
<div>2) Are you using online media feature of Media center extender?</div>
<div><br />
If you are using online media feature of Media center extender, you can refer to the link to try and solve this issue:<br />
“<strong>When I used the Online Media feature of Media Center Extender, I received an error message: "Video Error" or returns to the Gallery</strong>”<br />
Follow the section “<strong>Step 2: Update the Online Media settings for Media Center Extender</strong>”
<br />
You can also follow the section “<strong>Let me fix it myself</strong>” if the Microsoft Fixit in
<strong>step 2</strong> do not help.<br />

<p>Some more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hadn't used my TV tuner with no problems until Comcast went digital and then it was having this problem with every recording.&nbsp; Now it works and then doesn't and I haven't figured out the reasons why.&nbsp; Comcast suggested I use a cable card so I am going
 to check into it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have another solution other than&nbsp;a cable card, would be great.

            Hi Michael.
<div>I just recently got mine working again. &nbsp;It didn't have to do with drivers at all. &nbsp;What I had to do was re-establish the location of where I wanted my recordings to be saved. &nbsp;In other words I went into the media center removed the current setting for
 where my recorded shows would go, removed that usb drive from the computer, rebooted, attached a different usb drive, and setup the location of where the recordings would save to. &nbsp;I tested and it is now working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this will help you.</div>

            <p>I also had this problem i.e. when starting Windows Media Center with Hauppauge HVR-2250&nbsp; TV tuner installed, I got the error message "Files needed to display video are not installed or are not working correctly. Restart Media Center or computer". I tried
 several of the ideas posted online and none worked for me. Then I remembered that in the Hauppauge Troubleshooting section it says "A graphics card with at least 64 MBytes of memory
<strong>and the latest graphics driver from the manufacturer </strong>makes the (TV signal) decoding easier...".
</p>
<p>I went to Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;Device Manager&gt;Display adapters, and found I have an Intel HD Graphics 4000. Selecting that and then 'Driver' gave me the option to download the latest driver from the manufacturer which I did. The problem was eliminated
 and WMC works fine now.</p>

    <title>Icons are huge, font is different, and desktop gadgets are not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e_koste  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons are huge, font is different, and desktop gadgets are not working.</h2>
                    <p>The other day I merely restarted my computer, and when it booted back up, the icons on my desktop were huge. I tried to adjust their size but even at the smallest they looked completely different than they were before. Even adjusting the screen resolution
 did not work.</p>
<p>Also, all the font on my applications is different. It's larger and not the same as before.</p>
<p>The gadgets on my desktop (I have the calendar, the weather widget and my AVG security app) are either very large, or do not show up save for the writing which is outlined in this strange, pixel-y purple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried starting my computer in each of the different safe modes (safe mode, with networking, and with command prompts) and the issue does not exist in any of them; they are what my computer was like before this happened. What does that mean for my normal
 start up? I did an AVG scan and it didn't find any threats or viruses. Is is simply a program or feature that is changing these things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Eric</p>

<h2>            What do I need to do to play data discs on my PC with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot play data discs (containing Photos) with Windows 10.&nbsp; I use to be able to use IMGBURN to convert to .iso files then burn to a dvd as a video dvd and play on VLC but that no longer works.&nbsp; I would appreciate any suggestions on any software that will
 convert my data discs to something playable on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, my Autoplay does not work properly.&nbsp; I have Autoplay set to "on"&nbsp;and to ask me every time for the program to play the dvd but I never get the dropdown menu that will give me the choices.&nbsp; I have to open "MY PC" to try to play the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how do I determine if I have the capability to use the Windows DVD Player with Windows 10?&nbsp; It is listed with my apps but will not work with my data discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is kostas and i have this issue with the developer mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options of developer mode are grayed out and it says with yellow text on top:&nbsp;"Some settings are hidden or managed by your organasation.".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed91ff92-89d3-4cc8-9dbd-8c1ea9f94343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed91ff92-89d3-4cc8-9dbd-8c1ea9f94343" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 Enterprise, though my computer is a home computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a way to fix this but it doesn't work for me, i found others having the same problem but there is no fix for the fix if you get what i mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to go to Control Panel&gt;System And Security&gt;System&gt;Advanced system settings&gt;Computer Name&gt; and then click on the network id option. Finally there are 2 options, "This part is part of a Business Network; I use it to connect to other computers
 at work" and the fix recommends to change that to the second option "This is a home computer; its not a part of a business network". When i change that it says i should restart my computer for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/551e787a-71c5-4c50-9566-396c7e48bb15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/551e787a-71c5-4c50-9566-396c7e48bb15" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon restarting though i encounter the same problem. The yellow text is still there and the setting is set back to "This is a home computer; its not a part of a business network". Some help would be really appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Apps und Spiele frieren ein</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Leute ich belästige ich euch zu dieser späten Stunde mit zwei Problemen:</p>

<p>Sobald ich 'Dragon Age: Inquisition' von der Disk aus starten möchte friert das Spiel ein sobald man im Startmenü dazu aufgefordert wird die Menü-Taste zu drücken.</p>
<p>Weder die Disk noch meine XBOX One sind beschädigt und befinden sich in tadellosem Zustand.</p>
<p>Genauso verhält es sich mit meiner 'Internet Explorer' -App. &nbsp;Diese App startet erst gar nicht sondern belohnt mich stattdessen mit einem dauer Blackscreen.</p>

<p>Als eingefleischter DA Fan und bekennender Suchti der das Spiel noch nicht beendet hat (weil er ja unbedingt jede kleine Nebenquest machen musste) bitte ich um schnelle Hilfe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Falls Du eine Anleitung für "das übliche 'Cache löschen' brauchst:</p>
<p>Bei der laufenden Konsole den Xbox Sensor Power-Button an der Konsole für ca 15 Sekunden gedrückt halten. Darauf achten, dass die LED am Netzteil Orange wird.
</p>
<p>Dann das Stromkabel ziehen und 30 Sekunden warten. </p>
<p>Stromkabel wieder anstecken, und Konsole normal starten. </p>
<p>Jetzt sollen Spiel und Internet Explorer wieder problemlos laufen. </p>
<p>Wenn nicht, einfach nochmal hier posten. </p>

<p>ach das geht bei der ONE garnicht über die Software ? dachte das mit dem Powerknopf drücken wäre vergleichbar mit der LB RB X Sache auf der 360.</p>

<p>also you can check your current firmware version (bios) for your unit.</p>
<p><br />

<br />
if your not sure what to do here pay someone to do the job, as you can brick the unit ( that would be stuff it)<br />
<br />
should bios be current then you have other problems and need to look elsewhere.<br />

 I first installed the SSD I tried to clone my HDD onto it however, it turned out it was too much information. Ever since it doesn't show in 'Disk Management" nor under 'This PC' and have no idea how to assign a drive letter to it or partition it. It shows
 in 'Device Manager' as working. Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;HP

<p>
</p><p>The 128MB is the approximate size of a UEFI Partition of a SSD or HDD...</p>

<p>

<h2>            Blue Screen error 0x09F on Standby&#47;Hibernate</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm having a BSOD issue whenever I use Standby or Hibernate on my Windows 7 machines. I let the machine enter standby (either manually or via idle timer), and it simply fades to black, and then hangs at the black screen until it BSODs.<br />
<br />
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7086491/BSOD.zip<br />
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7086491/BSOD2.zip<br />
<br />
These files are minidumps from the BSODs.<br />
<br />
<br />
System configurations are:<br />
<br />
Thinkpad X200 | Core2Duo P8400 | 2x4GB DDR3 | Intel 5100AGN WiFi<br />
Thinkpad X41T | Pentium M 758LV | 2GB DDR3 | Intel 2915ABG WiFi<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<p>I have to agree with SpiritX here- the IRP definately pointed to NETwNs64.sys:</p>

</p>
<p>Have we checked the driver date on the&nbsp;X41T since then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one as we don't run into a lot of "Paired bluescreens" in the communities very often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
SInce driver verifier did not produce a BSOD the odds are the cause is some program<br />
you were running. Could even be two or more interacting. That the new install is working<br />
seems to verify that. Added that it was happening on two different machines.<br />
