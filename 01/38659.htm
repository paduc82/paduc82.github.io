            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />This error message means there is a missing component of Windows required to run the app or task. You'll need to download and install the Visual C++ package below:
<br />

<br />
<br />If that doesn't resolve the issue, try the System File Checker:

<h2>            Bluescreen on boot up Error&#58; 0x000000F4</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Bluescreen on boot up, can't boot in safe mode</p>
<p>My computer was running rather choppy, so I went to reboot, and now it just goes to a blue screen or won't boot at all.</p>
<p>My computer turns on, goes through the normal stuff, gets to the boot management page, I select Windows 7 (I still have XP installed on a seperate drive which is what I'm using to post this), the colored lights appear that swirl into the Windows logo and
 then it will either give a blue screen error, or it will simply stop boot and restart without one. I've tried running the startup repair utility but it offers no help. I have disconnected various peripherals and ran a check disk on the drive but I haven't
 changed anything that I can think of between the last successful bootup and now.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium, the blue screen's error message is as follows.</p>
<p>Stop: 0x000000F4 (0xFFFFFA8008A84AC0, 0xFFFFFA8008A238F0, 0xFFFFF80002BC5540)</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what other information from the crash I could get that would be useful.</p>

            I've seen the minidump thing mentioned elsewhere while searching for a solution. Is that a program I need to install or an option I need to configure? I searched the drive I have Windows 7 installed on and came up with no files or folders matching 'minidump'.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are unable to boot in safe mode, I would suggest you to boot the computer using Windows 7 disk</span><span>and
 run check disk utility from recovery console and try to boot to the desktop in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run Check disk utility in Windows recovery Environment (WINRE mode), follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Please insert the Windows 7 DVD and reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. When we are prompted to press a key to boot from the DVD, please press Enter or the space bar.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>6. On the System Recovery Options menu, click on Command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>7. In the command prompt window, t</span><span>ype<span>&nbsp;</span>the command
 &lt;tt&gt;<span>chkdsk C: /f /r and press enter</span>&lt;/tt&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the check disk is complete try to boot the computer in normal mode and verify if you are able to access desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not help, try to boot from Windows 7 disk and perform a system restore to the date it was working fine and check
 if it works. To run system restore from WINRE mode, follow the above steps from 1 to 5.<span>&nbsp;</span>In the system recovery option select System restore and click on next. Follow the wizard. Once the system restore completes, t</span><span>he
 computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I haven't been able to start my system in safe mode or otherwise since I held the off button at the login screen (I hadn't entered my password yet) to turn my system off.&nbsp; I downloaded my version of Windows 7 so I don't have the DVD to use the solution&nbsp;above.&nbsp;
 Is there a command prompt I can use to get access?</p>

I've tried searching on how to generate a minidump file, but I can't seem to get an answer. It seems to be assumed that one will be there, but I have none. Is there anything I could do that would generate such a minidump or could it be hidden in another location
 that wouldn't appear in full search of the computer?</p>

I followed your instructions and ran the check disk utility. It appeared to find and correct some errors, but afterwards when I attempted to boot up in normal mode it simply stopped and restarted. On the next attempt it gave a blue screen error similar to the
 one I already mentioned, but the last few digits of the 0xFFFFF numbers were different. They went by too quickly for me to write them down completely though. Attempting to boot into safe mode gave the same result. Next I attempted to perform a system restore,
 but since this installation is only 11 days old there was no restore point created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if I eventually must reformat and reinstall windows I would really like to know what caused and this issue, so that I don't run into this exact same scenario in another week and a half.</p>

I can already access my harddrive, I still have Windows XP installed on an older drive in the same system that I can boot to. At this point it looks like nothing can help, but I was hoping to avoid a clean install. Or at least figure out what caused the issue
 so that I could avoid it happening again. But apparently my computer isn't producing a minidump or any additional information that could be used to solve or at least identify the problem.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what you mean by registry tools, I haven't used any and therefor haven't discovered anything about them.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Do you get any error messages with regards to the Administrator privileges?<br />
2. Did you make any software changes to the computer recently?<br />
3. What happens when you attempt to go online? Do you get any error message?<br />
4. What kind of settings gets corrupted even after performing the recovery?</div>
<div><br />
You can disable the network card to get rid of the network devices but that will result in no internet connectivity.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try the methods below and observe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run Start Menu Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, let us run the<strong> Start Menu Troubleshooter</strong> through this
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Run System File Checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System File Checker </strong>is a Windows utility that allow users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. To run SFC scan, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type this <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit<strong> Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Run DISM commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If System File Checker did not find any violations it is still a good idea to run DISM. For instructions, please check ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP)'s article through this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">link</a></strong>.</p>

    <title>Twice Daily Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aptwalkerpatricia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Twice Daily Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>This is my first time asking a question, so hopefully this is going to the right area.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm getting twice daily Windows updates....have been for the past several weeks.&nbsp; I'm part of the Windows...gosh, don't even remember what it is called, a beta tester
 sort of group that my son put me in years ago so that I could get Windows 10 before it's public release.&nbsp; That may be why I have some of the issues I have, actually.&nbsp; I have NO control over Windows updates any more.&nbsp; I can't even find them in my Systems/Security
 in the control panel.&nbsp; I read where another person was having this problem and a moderator (I'm assuming) asked what KB update numbers were trying to be installed, and I can't find that info anywhere.&nbsp; I can't find a log of updates...NOTHING regarding Windows
 Updates at all.&nbsp; The only reference I see is in the Windows notifications section of Security Maintenance and the option to turn those on or off is grayed out, so again NO control over anything, other than being able to choose a time to restore at a later
 date if I prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update these things all the time, and have no indication that they are not doing it properly...they seem to be.&nbsp; This is really nuts.&nbsp; How do I get back some ability to control when these updates are happening, or if I want to go with important updates
 only?&nbsp; Maybe I need to stop being on that Windows Insider group...remembered the name finally.&nbsp; Perhaps they have frozen all the controls for some reason.&nbsp; Now to figure out how to get out of that mess &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and I'm Windows 10 64 bit version, and clearly chronically updated to whatever the most recent versions are whether I want to or not :)</p>

            Hi Patricia.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can turn off preview versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Insider Program.  
<br />
<br />You can get more control over WIndows Updates here:

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks, Greg.&nbsp; I realized after sending this off that I needed to search to find out how to get out of the Insider group.&nbsp; So that led me to a link that showed me the access that you have mentioned here.&nbsp; It has been driving me batty trying to figure out
 why I couldn't find anything in the areas that they have been for years and years, and years...okay, I'm old(er) :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the variety of links.&nbsp; I'll read them all.&nbsp; The one place I found said that I could leave the group, and when I did what it said, they offered me ways to change my updates, but not to actually leave.&nbsp; Okay....&nbsp; I don't mind staying in the group
 as long as I can hold off updates for a week at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other thing I've noticed is that if I 'ignore' restarting when they want to update by just choosing the 'not now' option or something similar, my system begins to lag badly.&nbsp; I mean can't move things around..it's a nightmare.&nbsp; I swear they do it to force
 you to stop ignoring them :)&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact it was to the point that when my system started doing that I'd go to the 'reboot' button and sure enough it would say 'update and restart'.&nbsp; I'd not had any notifications of the need to update before that.&nbsp; I simply figured
 out the behaviour pattern after a few episodes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you again, for your help.&nbsp; It is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I wish I could have replied to one guy that smart mouthed an answer to someone else asking to get out of the WI program.&nbsp; It was in a Windows Community message center, no less.&nbsp; I don't know if
 it was a 'tech' but the name looked rather like it could be.&nbsp; He sarcastically stated....'learn to search the internet for your answers...then provided an 'ask.com' link.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to scream at him...How the 'f' do you think I got here, idiot!?&nbsp; &nbsp; Fortunately,
 they had replies turned off :)&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the link he gave did show me the access through the Settings menu, so I cooled off...sort of :)</p>

            I would leave the Insider program which will always provide unstable builds when you need a stable one and not to be a guinea pig.  That's for enthusiasts who like to trial software.  I don't even have time for it myself with all the problems we deal with here by the thousands in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />If you ever decide you need a break from the Windows Updates, there's an easy way to shut them off for awhile in one of the links I gave you.  Just set a Metered Connection by clicking the internet connection icon in your System Tray at the right end of task bar, then click Properties on your network.  Done.

            I was reading about that manner of doing it. It sounds like you have to go back in and change the setting again when you do want to do the updates.&nbsp; I'm not sure it's worth going that far.&nbsp; I think I'm going to search harder to find out how to actually
 leave their group.&nbsp; I'm no help to them because they get '0' feedback from me.&nbsp; My son did this before the initial release of Win 10 so that I could get the new version before it was available.&nbsp; I think my system was having problems with the Win 8 version
 and he'd read that Win 10 had fixed the issues.&nbsp; How many years ago was that?&nbsp; I think it's time to admit I'm a poser and humbly withdraw from the program :)&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't think the usual updates will be that much of an issue.&nbsp; I do mean it when I say that this
 has been two updates every day for at least two weeks now.&nbsp; I have no idea what they are doing, but I'm beginning to fear that I may be preparing to give birth to Skynet.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            Are you sure you're in the Insider program?  I showed you how to check and leave if you are.  I would do that now.  Here's an article that explains how and why it's especially important now:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/why-you-should-opt-out-windows-insider-program-after-april-2018-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/why-you-should-o...</a>

            Thanks for the additional link.&nbsp; Yes I am.&nbsp; I get emails and requests to give feedback on things.&nbsp; I just ignore them since I have no clue what they really are asking about.&nbsp; That's not entirely true, but I don't take the time anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did go in and
 as I said earlier, I found the Insider Group option and clicked on that.&nbsp; I had to let it fix something (having to do with data allowed) before I got to the point that I had the dialogue box that offered me the option to 'leave the Insiders Group'.&nbsp; However,
 the three options that it gave me were three options for handling updates when I clicked on the 'leave group'.&nbsp; I didn't see any other options to leave, but I may have overlooked it.&nbsp; Stopping the overwhelming number of updates was my main goal, so I didn't
 pursue it any further.&nbsp; I will take a look at this article, and pursue this further.&nbsp; I'm not doing the group any good, and if there are significant reasons to abandon ship rather

<p>Okay, Greg.&nbsp; I have a question...&nbsp; In the link you gave, the 'safe' option is to keep getting 'builds' until the next version of Windows is released, and then I will no longer get updates.&nbsp; I could swear that option was in there earlier, but it's not now.&nbsp;
 It offers me the option to 'stop all Insider Builds completely' and I'll be opted out of all future updates.&nbsp; I had to 'resume' my build update options before I got the 'Stop Insider Builds' dialogue box, since I had paused the update times earlier.&nbsp; So now
 the option to keep getting updates until the next release is no longer there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Before I accept the 'Stop all builds completely' option, I wanted to check to make sure I am not making a mistake in doing so.&nbsp; I doubt it, but would rather be sure it's the safe
 move.&nbsp; Thanks for taking all this time with me.</p>

            Hi again Pat -
<br />
<br />Yes, what you want is to Stop all Insider Builds completely.  
<br />
<br />Then observe if it rolls you back to the present build which is 1803.  You can check this at Settings &gt; System &gt; About under Version.  
<br />
<br />If not and you want to be on the latest stable Version 1803, see if you can Go Back to Last Version at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery.  
<br />
<br />If not you'll need to stay at the latest build until a new Version is released through Windows Update.  It will be labeled "Feature Version ****" and come via WIndows Update.  If there are any problems installing it then you can manually install it by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link, open the tool and choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can bookmark this thread and always come back to ask for help from me, or start a new thread for any further issue.

            Okay, well did that and it took me back to version 1709 according to my System info.&nbsp; However, I don't know what version I was on before I stopped the rebuilds, so can't say for sure where it was.&nbsp; I did have the option to go back to the previous version
 of Windows..I don't recall how it stated it exactly, but it didn't specifically say that it was stopping all rebuilds after that, so I went with the 'STOP IT' option.&nbsp; &nbsp; It doesn't appear that 'restoring' to a previous version is my answer, so Windows is checking
 for updates...and checking, and checking, and checking...&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure it will get me to the latest version eventually.&nbsp; I am bookmarking this, thanks :)

<h2>            Windows Explorer in Windows 7 acting very odd....</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Over the past month I have noticed an odd behaviour when using Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>When I open Windows Explorer&nbsp;and&nbsp;click on a&nbsp;folder I want to view the folder pane pops back up to "Libraries" burying the folder I want&nbsp;at&nbsp;the bottom of the Window.</p>
<p>This is very annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any else experience this?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And solutions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going crazy trying to figure this one out.</p>
<p>Windows Explorer is also crashing once and a while when moving / deleting files.</p>
<p>This is of course in comparison to using Windows Explorer with Windows XP (never really had any issues for seven years while using it)</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

This shows one way to reproduce it, clicking the triangle to expand a folder you're currently viewing also reproduces it.

<strong>Left Pane Scroll Bug threads:</strong>
<strong>1. Bug: Windows Explorer expands folders inappropriately, jumping the folder you expand to the bottom of the navigation pane</strong><strong><br />
<br />
2. Windows explorer tree view expands at the bottom, not at the top as it used to be<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>3. Windows Explorer navigation pane issue</strong><strong><br />
<br />
4. Windows explorer moves the selected folder to bottom of folders list. How do I stop this?</strong><strong><br />

<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use
 and have the features you want, here is a list of most that are available:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong>
<p>Since many people seem to agree that some or all the changes made to Windows Explorer have actually made it less user friendly, you can go to the Windows 7 Feedback page and (politely) let them know your suggestions for improving it:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195</a></p>
<p>Note: don't make the message too long, there is a size limit to your message even though the page doesn't tell you about it. Also, don't just copy and paste from the list above - they will think the same person is repeatedly submitting feedback.</p>

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

<h2>            No boot after installing Windows Update KB3000850, unable to get to safe mode or perform system restore</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: KB3000850 Cannot boot or restore</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the update on my Asus k55a laptop which uses avast for security... I restart, &nbsp;asus splash with quaint circle dots, black screen, &nbsp;hard drive stops except for a blip once and a while. &nbsp;Waited an hour after restating sevral times. I can't seem
 to boot into safe mode, &nbsp;I've tried f5, f8, soft with both. &nbsp;Every option I could see in the BIOS. With an unbelievable stroke of luck I have an old usb that I am able to get into the windows trouble shooting options. When I refresh, &nbsp;the drive is locked.
 &nbsp;Automatic repair, &nbsp;couldn't repair my PC. &nbsp;System restore, &nbsp;looks promising, &nbsp;did not restore successfully. Unspecified error 0x80070005 (sounds specific). I have not done a reset yet, &nbsp;I am deeply hoping to avoid it. &nbsp;This is my only pc, I only have access
 to wifi sporadically, &nbsp;doing all my research on my mobile. &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;I would love for someone to show me something simple I overlooked.&nbsp;</p>

            No media in or attached to the machine. &nbsp;I did not mention please wait. &nbsp;I included all errors received. Upgraded from 8 to 8.1, also have the pro pack. Startup repair did not launch automatically. &nbsp;The recovery environment only launched once I put in
 an old usb drove for the heck of it and hit escape to boot from usb. All of the errors I mentioned earlier happened after getting to this point. Automatic repair in the Recovery Environment did not work as I mentioned earlier with the aforementioned error.
 I could not find "startup settings" in any accessable area in the Recovery Environment. I do not have recovery media. (I know). Finally there is no key code sicker on the Asus laptop (thank you best buy)

            Ah. I stopped trying to use bing in '09. I don't use multiple search engines to investigate potential conflicts with all popular software prior to installing each Microsoft released update. &nbsp;I'll chalk that up to laziness on my part.

            <p>Hello Jonathan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Appreciate the time taken by you in keeping us updated on the status of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand, that must be very frustrating when suddenly your computer stopped working just after installing Windows Updates. however, we'll try our best to get this issue resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, we need to get to Windows Startup settings in Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)/Advanced Options, for that we need to have a Windows 8 or 8.1 installation media. If you do not have an installation media you can create one. Refer the article in
 the above suggested method 1 to create an installation media. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have an installation media you can get to Windows startup settings in&nbsp;Advanced Options&nbsp;and perform different recovery options to repair Windows.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>From advanced options you may chose to restore your computer back to the time before installing that particular update. If that doesn't work from startup settings, you may try to start your computer in Safe Mode, or Safe mode with command prompt and run
 different Windows repair commands to restore Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You can use System Restore to revert computer settings back to their previous state before installing those updates.
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You may follow the steps below to perform system restore:

            What kind of computer do you have? What wireless hardware? What is the answer to The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
In the meantime reinstall the drivers for your wireless network adapter. And you should be at Service Pack 3.

            Hi Ann.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />I would power off, wait 30 minutes and then power back on to see if it continues or rolls back.  If not then there's been a catastrophic failure which we will help you overcome in such a way you end up with a much better install.  
<br />
<br />Create the bootable Windows 10 installation media to do the vastly superior Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and method, and has zero reported problems from those who do so:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have files that need rescuiing this can also be done first from the booted media following this step:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have a separate data partition, then your files should be safe as long as you only select the C partition to reinstall, although this doesn't get it as clean as deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space.  If you don't format C but just select it and click Next, your files will even be archived in a C:\windows.old folder to retrieve after install.  
<br />
<br />If you want you can also try first running the Reset from the booted Media which is a more stable method and may complete this time:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ann, you will have to start the reset again, that is not normal . . .
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Volume Mixer Annoyance</h2>
                    
<p>Im running Vista 64bit SP2. My volume mixer is being annoying. Before the update to SP1 it was fine. In the Volume Mixer, my Applications used to display the icon of the program running. Now all it does is display the name and a generic windows icon for
 them. What could be the cause of this?</p>

<p>After the above :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take
<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            If you go to the Canon website in the following link it shows that the last drivers were for XP.&nbsp; Also, if you click on "Service and Support" at that link and then search "Windows 7" you will find a document that lists the BJC series printers that are
 supported for Windows 7 and the 250 isn't on that list.&nbsp; Here is the Canon link:

I thought maybe the BJC-240 which is supported might be close enough, but based on the following where the user asking the question said he tried that driver, it apparently is not:&nbsp;
