<p>Hello! I was just wondering, my friend invited me to this community website for gamers called Playfire.com. Everything seems pretty legit, but when i try to make an account, it asks me to sign in with my xbox live info. I'm kinda skeptical about this.. but
 it says it's to retrieve my friendslist &amp; i quote "&nbsp;</p>
How does it work?&nbsp;
<p>Use our&nbsp;<strong>secure</strong>&nbsp;HTTPS form to log in to Xbox Live and we'll retrieve your friends list. From there you can pick who you want to follow.</p>
<p>None of your personal details are ever saved.</p>
<p>Playfire is an&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Community Developer</strong>. "<br />
<br />
I just want to make sure. I &lt;3 this account &amp; put many years of work into it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It does seem legit, apparently the site has been running since 2007.</p>
<p>It has it's own entry on wikipedia:&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfire</a>, and its own Twitter feed:&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/playfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://twitter.com/#!/playfire</a></p>
<p>It looks like it is the same sort of site that Raptr is.</p>
<p>I would <em>personally</em>&nbsp;say that this site is fine. However, if you are not 100% certain, do not give them your details</p>
<p>If it means anything, i'm signing up to it just now.</p>

<p>Hey RiP x APHEX,</p>
<p>My name is Kieran and I'm one of the creators of Playfire. We're a social networking website for gamers where you can show off your games/achievements, follow what all of your friends are playing, and see which hot games are coming out.</p>
<p>Naturally it's really important to have friends on the site, so we created a simple tool to search for which XBL friends are already here and invite them if they're not. Clearly one of your friends wanted you on the site so invited you!</p>
<p>The whole website is completely secure, and we're an official Xbox Community Developer. None of your details are ever saved at any point in the process. Hope that clears up any confusion!</p>
<p>If you have any more questions you can email me directly on kieran at playfire dot com and I'll be happy to help answer anything you're curious about.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kieran</p>

<p>Kieran, I see you answering numerous questions, but you havent answered one very specific question. Why do you need our login info? Every other tracking site I've ever seen only needs your gamertag. So why the need for our credentials? I can't think of one
 reason why you would need to see our login. And I'm especially concerned for those customers who enter their credit card info into them. In other words, this sounds very suspect, and seeing forum moderators telling us not to give out that info doesn't really
 help your cause.</p>

<p>@BIGWIG</p>
<p>If you don't want to login to Live just sign up normally at www.playfire.com. If you want to claim the profile that your friends made for you, you need to verify that you're the gamertag owner. This is because people kept taking other people's profile when
 we didn't have vertification.</p>
<p>Hope this clears this up. If you want to ask any more Qs you can email me directly on kieran at playfire com if you want.</p>

<p><span>"<span><strong>The whole website is completely secure, and we're an official Xbox Community Developer.</strong>" &lt;-- very incorrect answer. So if I pay the thousands of dollars to get into the XBL API and be able to use it, that also grants me the

<p><span>I see an irregularity here Kieran. See this "<strong>official LIVE sites or on your console.</strong>" and then you make the claim that you are an "<strong>official Xbox Community Developer"</strong>&nbsp;and that makes this friend finder official and ok
 to use? I do not understand, something does not sit well with me in your statements. You seem to talk in circles at times with your claims of legitimacy of your site.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;I got a message from one of my friends that&nbsp;he says he&nbsp;didn't send telling me to check out Playfire. The URL in the message was for a page specifically containing my gamertag.&nbsp;I typed the&nbsp;URL in, but with his gamertag instead and&nbsp;it toook me to the same
 profile creation page as my gamertag did. <strong>How did Playfire get my gamertag from my friend if he doesn't have a profile on the site?
</strong>I've seen a serialized output from the XDCP feeds and I don't remember either of them containing friends list information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tested it out with a profile that has no friends. Give it a go. Type in "https://www.playfire.com/xbox/<strong>anything you want</strong>&nbsp;(literally, anything. Even things that can't be gamertags because of profanity.) and hit enter. It will always
 say "6 of your gaming friends want you to join them on Playfrire!" It's funny that I read that the site doesn't ask for your Live ID email and password but you need them to claim your profile when it's been "pre-created." I've also read that you can just type
 in your gamertag and that's all you need. But then&nbsp;why does the site ask for your gamertag before you even create an account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that matter, why is the cofounder/CEO (or are you a developer? Both?) of the company spending the time to browse the Xbox forums to answer questions like this? Seems like you'd have someone to do that for you. Do you even have a profile on the site that
 you use? You're gamertag comes back with a 404 and Kieran is a profile that apparently has been created but never updated. And if you are a developer, are you aware of the fact that your BBC and IGN links at the bottom of the page the URL in the message directs
 you to aren't working?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been reading in a few&nbsp;threads about this and I've finally settled on where to post this. I'm debating sending an email directly to Microsoft (and Sony) to check the claim that Playfire is partnered. I did find on GameSpot Fuse's FAQ page that they do
 support Playfire. While the purpose of the site doesn't bother me, the execution seems odd. Every site that I've ever been to that required my Live ID password has redirected me to login.live.com or something similar to that. It's hard to trust third-party
 sites with profile information since PSN got hacked so recently.</p>

<h2>            Camcorder doesn&#39;t upload video using the firewire cable</h2>
                    
<p>My computer with Windows 7 home premium&nbsp;32bit will not allow me to upload videos from my Samsung minidv camcorder. I have used the camcorder previously with an old computer with xp and had no problems in uploading the footage. The camcorder will show up
 in devices but not allow me to upload footage in windows movie maker.</p>
<p>I am using a belkin 4pin to 4pin firewire cable to&nbsp;connect the camcorder&nbsp;to the computer ( I previously used a 4pin to 6pin with the old computer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Looking for latest drivers with Samsung with no luck in finding any</div>
</li><li>
<div>Uninstalling the driver and reinstalling the driver on the camcorder</div>
</li><li>
<div>I have changed the driver in <span><span><span>IEEE 1394 Bus Host Controllers to1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy).</span></span></span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><span>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span></span></span></p>

Before we can begin to investigate you need to update a bunch of drivers from as far back as 2005 and remove Kaspersky (at least to test) and use the built in Defender.<br />
<br />
<div><b>The pre 2009 version of this driver is a known BSOD cause.<br />

    <title>Having trouble connecting to realms on Minecraft, Windows 10 Edition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having trouble connecting to realms on Minecraft, Windows 10 Edition</h2>
                    <p>Thanks in advance for anyone able to help,</p>
<p>Upon attempting to use realms on Minecraft, Windows 10 Edition, I was met with this response: "You Need Permission: You cannot play on Realms because of how your Xbox Live account is set up.&nbsp; This can be changed in your privacy and online safety settings
 on xbox.com"</p>
<p>After trying to reach the page related to online safety settings, I clicked the link to "account.xbox.com" that is supposed to allow me to change these settings.&nbsp; However, this simply links back to the original page.&nbsp; This account was created from windows
 10 and I am the controller of the account, and there are no privacy settings preventing me from doing this to my knowledge.&nbsp; If anyone has any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Double-click the glass at the top of the dialog, and it should restore to normal size. &nbsp;As a tip, this works for almost any program.</p>
<p>If the dialog is already "restored" (that is, not actually maximized but stretched out nontheless), you can drag from the sides to resize it manually.</p>

    <title>Should I upgrade my IBM T43 to Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lang s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I upgrade my IBM T43 to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Windows XP but I understand support will be discontinued. In addition to the issue of having to copy everything to an external drive and then bring it back, I have a few more concerns. Why do I have to make 16gb of free space on my drive?
 Does the OS really take up that much more space? Will I be able to restore files from XP backups to the upgraded system? Which version should I get? Does the Home Premium edition come with backup &amp; restore capability? Will this forum still provide discussion
 and answers after official support of XP ends? Should I consider jumping to Windows 8 and bypassing 7?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can restore files from Windows XP to Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/restore-a-backup-created-on-a-previous-version-of-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/restore-a-backup-created-on-a-previous-version-of-windows</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and Install Windows Upgrade Advisor and see if the hardware is capable to install Windows 7.
</p>

<h2>            I got 2 BSOD&#39;s since installing a new WD Ultra Passport.</h2>
                    <p>I already had a smaller WD Elements backing up, and decided I should have a second backup for critical files. But when I have too many programs running and files open on my fairly new workhorse laptop, I get the BSOD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on why this might be happening, and what I can do to prevent blue-outs?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

            <p>There is a good chance the first BSOD (DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL)&nbsp;was caused by the klwtp.sys which is a Kaspersky driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of Kaspersky that is presently installed may not be fully compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest&nbsp;to uninstall, at least temporarily, Kaspersky and use just Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also appears to be a McAfee&nbsp;driver (mfehidk.sys)&nbsp;loaded on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was McAfee previously installed and then uninstalled or is there McAfee software presently installed?</p>

            I have not liked Windows Defender (sorry, Bill Gates)--I didn't find it strong enough. &nbsp;So I need Kaspersky. I don't see McAfee in my programs, so I assume it's gone. &nbsp;I think I have Windows configured to automatically update all my software. &nbsp;Should I
 ask Kaspersky if they have an update, and/or if they're familiar with this problem? &nbsp;Thanks for sticking with me.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to join Servers in BHD Blackhawk Down</h2>
                    I have ran the compatibility Wizard still no help, I have put my IP on the DMZ, I have ran as administrator, safe mode (i can reach our Teamspeak with safemode, I cannot with a normal boot). All my drivers are updated and Change User Account Settings is
 Disabled). I have ran windows firewall (allowing BHD to pass through firewall) and I have disabled Firewall. Still I get to the point of "Joining Session" but I never connect. I had no issues with WinXP 64.
<br />
<br />
Anything else I am missing ? Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi <strong>JerzeeJoe,</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
As it works fine in safe mode but not in normal mode. Try performing clean boot and check what happens.</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.
<br />
<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>
<p>If that does not fix the issue I would suggest that you to contact <strong>novalogic support.</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 home 64 bit ram limit.</h2>
                    Ok, so I have 32gb of ram and my window 7 64 bit can only use 16 of it right now. I know I can upgrade to ult to get the remaining but I was thinking about upgrading to window 10 home. Will it still be limited to 16 or will it use the full 32.

<h2>            Gift Card with missing letters and lost receipt</h2>
                    <p>Hello...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I lost 100USD for MS...So basically I scratched too hard the code on my gift card, and in the process I lost 3 letters of my code. I don’t have the receipt anymore and just the Activation Receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always thought the activation receipt was the important one, turns out that receipt is useless.
</p>
<p>I contact the place where I bought and they can’t find my receipt. I contacted Microsoft, and they can’t do anything without the receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to check if the community knows a way to help me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not at least I wish to give you all an alert, ALWAYS save the receipt, the real receipt, and not the useless activation receipt. Also if you are given this as a gift to someone, scan the receipt and save it for later, if needed.<br />

<p>Hello...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I lost 100USD for MS...So basically I scratched too hard the code on my gift card, and in the process I lost 3 letters of my code. I don’t have the receipt anymore and just the Activation Receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always thought the activation receipt was the important one, turns out that receipt is useless.
</p>
<p>I contact the place where I bought and they can’t find my receipt. I contacted Microsoft, and they can’t do anything without the receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to check if the community knows a way to help me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not at least I wish to give you all an alert, ALWAYS save the receipt, the real receipt, and not the useless activation receipt. Also if you are given this as a gift to someone, scan the receipt and save it for later, if needed.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really sorry to hear about your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Retailer Printed code on Receipt Scenario</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option would have been the retailer for them to reprint the code. I understand you said they were unable to find the receipt but personally I would ask them again for further assistance otherwise you are going to have to spend long long time trying
 to guess the missing digits :(</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Physical Xbox Gift Card Scenario</strong></p>
<p>If you purchased an physical Xbox gift card from the store then the retailer is unable to help you in anyway as they cannot see the code you purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom Left/Right i believe there is a code which is unique to that gift card. I would suggest contacting Xbox Support again and see if they can help you with this information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never bought an physical card for years but previously they did have some number, sorry if this isn't the case anymore.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
PGTiPs<br />

<p>To be honest I don't know how you managed to remove digits from the card you must have been really hard on the card to remove the foil.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Run the hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Test the issue in clean boot mode.</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Also, see the
 section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “<b>Reset the computer to start as usual</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable and re-enable the USB controllers:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>devmgmt.msc</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>. Device Manager opens. </span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. <br />
<b>Note:</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item. </span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Restart the computer. After
 the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the
<b>Bluetooth peripheral device</b> and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<b>Start</b> button. </span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type<b> devmgmt.msc</b> and then press
<b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the
<b>Bluetooth peripheral</b> device and right click on it</span></p>
<p><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select<b> Update</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, you may check for an updated driver from the manufacturer and install the latest version.</span></p>

<p>Hey there Kaan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get Game Pass. </p>
<p>I would say if your omney was withdrawn and the order comes up in your order history in Settings&gt; Account&gt; Payment &amp; Billing&gt; Order History, that you then go ahead and remove and redownload your profile as outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to add or remove a Microsoft account on Xbox One</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, then I would probably go to contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>and see if and agent can help you get to the bottom of this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps, thanks for reading!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Be sure to check the order history of any alternate accounts you may have just to ensure Game Pass wasn't purchased on another account; also, you may want to check back with your bank to verify the charge was processed for the subscription.</p>

<p>Hello gillesmousseau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your error code indicates that the camera app is unable to create the file, this usually indicates that there is a permissions issue with your currently logged in user being able to write to the "Camera Roll" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'd recommend following the steps in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13756/windows-10-fix-missing-camera-roll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to troubleshoot camera issues on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Play Movie I Bought</h2>
                    
<p>Went to watch Harold and Kumar Christmas. A movie we BOUGHT when first offered on XBox. System says our movie will not be available due to distributor. This is already unacceptable. Out of curiosity, we looked through our XFinity app, unsurprisingly, Warner
 Bros is now selling via Comcast on demand. &nbsp;This is a scam. This is why people pirate content. Either maintain a product we purchased or refund the costs. Regardless of this outcome, I am done buying media on XBox live, telling friends to never buy, and no
 I've got a great "Scrooge" piece my editor has been bugging me about.&nbsp;</p>

If so and if you bought it, it should show up in your purchase history as such where you should be able to download it again. If you have switched Xbox's since you bought the movie, then you will not be able to watch it as content licenses for movies and tv shows do not transfer Xbox's.</p>

<p>I just had the same thing happen with "X-Men: First Class". It's actually the ONLY movie I've bought on the Xbox video system (have others via Amazon Instant Video). @onyx62is, I think you partially missed the OP's point that he should be refunded the money
 or points (his choice) if this happens. To just have it no longer be available when he BOUGHT it (not rented) seems like a violation of the whole concept of buying a movie. And please, don't go saying "Oh, that's covered in the TOS!" Those things don't hold
 up in court if they are unfair or the maker has disproportionate power to the end consumer (i.e. everyone's terms are the same). Especially when you consider that the average american would have to spend over four years doing nothing but reading TOS's if we
 REALLY read them all.</p>

<p>I just had the same thing happen with X-men First Class....TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!. I'm surprised a big stink hasn't come about because of this yet. I'd wondered what would happen as time passed with the content we purchase on there....looks like you eventually
 lose it.....at least licensed content anyway. I for one WON'T be buying another movie.</p>

<h2>            Child&#39;s account - grant permission</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to grant permission for my son to play Roblox on his Xbox one. He has downloaded the app but when he tries to play, it says he needs to change his privacy settings to see other users content. I worried about&nbsp;unlocking too much and have read that I can grant full permission just for a particular app. On the support pages it says very simply, "choose who will grant permission to use the app". I can't find that screen. When he plays it doesn't give him any option to ask for permission. &nbsp;How do I allow him to play? How do I grant permission for particular apps?</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to access Bluetooth on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hafiz mohammed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access Bluetooth on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>For the last few years, I've been using&nbsp;an Acer Aspire 4752G&nbsp;notebook that has an
<strong>inbuilt Bluetooth feature</strong>. I'd recently upgraded to Windows 10 (from Windows 7) a few months back, but since then I've not been able to access my computer's Bluetooth. I've looked up in the internet and have tried<strong> as many solutions
 possible </strong>to set it right, but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">none</span> of them could help my situation. The following information&nbsp;sums up&nbsp;my case (and what I'd done):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The Bluetooth switch does not appear in my notifications tray, nor does a Bluetooth&nbsp;setting option&nbsp;appear in the Windows Settings Feature.
</li><li>In the Device Manager, the Bluetooth driver is not visible (even&nbsp;after looking up&nbsp;the hidden items). Although I couldn't find&nbsp;the driver, I've tried to install an updated driver to activate Bluetooth (my downloads folder is now&nbsp;filled with all kinds of
 driver software)&nbsp;but with no success. Troubleshooting also didn't help.</li><li>I've gone to the 'services.msc' feature and changed the startup setting of 'Bluetooth Support Services' from "Manual' to 'Automatic' (and also restarted it after that); which also was of no use, as it turned out.</li><li>In the Device Manager, I'd gone to the 'Add Legacy Hardware Wizard', but I couldn't find any Bluetooth-related drivers&nbsp;there.</li></ul>
<p>Before I'd set out to do all this, I'd noticed that <em>sometimes</em>, a Bluetooth switch used to appear in the notifications tray, which then would've disappeared after I got back. But this was the only form of access I had to my Bluetooth (even then,
 I couldn't connect any devices through Bluetooth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;doing <strong>ALL</strong> of this, I'm still not able to access&nbsp;the Bluetooth on my computer which I had done when I'd been running on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I'm really desperate to access&nbsp;Bluetooth. I would be extremely grateful to anyone who could help me in solving my problem.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Is the issue confined only playing DVD on the laptop?<br />
2. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Is the issue confined when playing specific DVD?
<div><br />
If you receive this error message the first time you try to play a DVD, you might not have a DVD decoder installed, or your decoder software might need to be updated. In addition to your DVD-ROM drive and Player software, you must have either a software or
 hardware decoder to play DVDs. Hardware decoders and their drivers are available from third-party manufacturers. For more information about software decoders, see DVD Decoder Plug-ins.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins</a></div>
<div>.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Try running the Fix it tool from the link provided below and check if it helps.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems/en-us</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Perform Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
To play DVDs, you may have a DVD-ROM drive and a software or hardware DVD decoder installed on your computer. If you do not have a compatible DVD decoder installed, DVD-related commands, options, and controls do not appear in the Player and you cannot play
 DVDs. By default, Windows does not include a DVD decoder. For more information have a look at the following article:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro &#40;1703&#41;&#58; Unable to create new user accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a new account on my system which I have upgraded to the Creators Update recently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to add a new Microsoft Account, the process fails with error 0xd0070005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to setup a local account (using the Computer Management Console), all seems fine until I try to login with that new user. I'm getting a "Access Denied" error from the User Profile Service (EventID 1500). No user folder is created in c:\Users.</p>
<p>I've tried another angle by using "runas /user:&lt;new user&gt; cmd" which also ends in an "Access denied". Although I was able to trace things with "ProcMon". ProcMon logged several "Access Denied" errors in the Registry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKU\S-1-5-21-3358352006-1693011757-3251293416-1005\AppEvents\EventLabels</p>
<p>HKU\S-1-5-21-3358352006-1693011757-3251293416-1005\AppEvents\Schemes</p>
<p>HKU\S-1-5-21-3358352006-1693011757-3251293416-1005\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics</p>
<p>HKU\S-1-5-21-3358352006-1693011757-3251293416-1005\Software\Microsoft\AuthCookies\Live\Default</p>
<p>.... and a few more</p>
<p>
</p><p>These keys, in fact everything including "HKU\S-1-5-21-3358352006-1693011757-3251293416-1005", should be created from scratch for the new user. It doesn't really make sense to suddenly get a "Access denied" within a registry path that is just being created.
 The are plenty of other "RegOpenKey" operations in this path which are processed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know since when this issue existed on my system or if it was introduced with the Creators Edition update. All pre-existing users where migrated fine by the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to remedy this problem? Maybe it's even a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may occur if the user profile folder was deleted manually. A profile folder that is manually deleted does not remove the Security Identifier (SID) from the profile list in the registry. The default profile on your computer might be corrupted while
 upgrading to Windows 10 from an older version of Windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have several troubleshooting steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947215/you-receive-a-the-user-profile-service-failed-the-logon-error-message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>that could help us resolve the issue. This page is also applicable with Windows 10. Kindly follow the steps under the category "<strong>Method 1: Fix the the user account profile</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know with the results.</p>

<p>Hello Haidae,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your response. I came across this very same article during my search for a fix. Unfortunately it doesn't fit my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below "ProfileList" I can only find the SSIDs of the (working) user accounts that I created way before upgrading to the Creators Update. As I said: I'm trying to create a brand new user account. The profile folder and Reg-Keys should be created at the first
 login/execution of "runas".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to repair the default users Profile? It may have gotten corrupted during the inplace updates to Anniversary or Creators update, I reccon. I'm afraid when I try to use the default profile from the latest Insider build, I will screw up the system
 even more, won't I? ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed my problem. Although the question how I got the system into the faulty state remains unanswered...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a fresh install of Windows 10 Creators Update in a Hyper-V VM, though I think any other virtualisation technology will do as well. Once everything was up and running I tried creating a new user in that VM: it worked like a charm.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, after you log off from the remote desktop session to Terminal Server, changes to the user profile are not saved correctly on the profile server, and the user profile is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a workaround you can refer to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the User to local Administrator Group on the Server where they have Profile Folders.</li><li>Delete the profile and let the user create the profile during next logon.</li></ol>
<p>If the steps mentioned did not work, you can also follow the troubleshooting steps provided by

<p>Thanks for your feedback, Haidae.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurred when trying to create a user account from scratch on a standalone machine without connection to a domain. So neither Terminal Server, Remote Desktop sessions or roaming profiles were involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I replaced the template on which base a new user account is build upon (c:\users\Default) the question still remains on how the template got corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the Creators Update to be involved in this. On a laptop that I just upgraded to Creators Update I can't create new users as well. That laptop wasn't used much after a clean installation of Win10 1603 (Anniversary Update). There was not much time
 to dig into it further, but I suspect that the Default-Userprofile is corrupted as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can provide further details, logs, traces, ... please let me know.</p>

<p>Corrupt User Profiles are common in Windows, especially after the upgrade from Windows 8.1/7 to Windows 10, and various solutions for this problem could be applied, depending on the situation and error message you receive. Users say that user profile can
 become corrupted because a lot of things, so we don’t know exactly what causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these workaround to create a new user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your computer, and login to the admin account again (it’s better to use this account, than account you just created)</li><li>Navigate to the corrupt user account (it’s on the disk you have Windows installed on (usually C:), under Users)</li><li>Open your corrupted user profile and copy content form it to your new user profile</li><li>Once everything is done, logout from your admin account, and log back in to the new account, and your settings should be transferred.</li></ol>
<p>Also, check if you enabling hidden admin account will resolve the issue. Follow the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your computer and boot into <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode.</a></li><li>Open Command Prompt (by right-clicking on the Start Menu button, and choosing Command Prompt Admin)</li><li>Type in the following command and press Enter: net user administrator /active:yes</li><li>You should get “The command completed successfully” message. Reboot your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You have activated the admin account, and it will be available to login on the next boot. So, when your computer starts, just login into the admin account and follow the steps below, to create a new user profile:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings, and then to Accounts</li><li>Go to Family and other users</li><li>Click on Add someone else to this computer</li><li>Follow the instructions and finish the creation of new users profile.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this solution helped you to restore your user profile.</p>

<p>Hello Haidae,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix my second system having profile trouble using the "xcopy" approach.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the folder "%HOMEDRIVE%\users\Default" from a healthy OS [i.e. Win10 fresh install in a VM] onto the faulty machine by using "xcopy" and a few switches.</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">xcopy e:\Users\Default c:\Users\Default /E /H /K /O /I</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This approach worked twice for me. Thank you very much for your assistance and feedback.</p>
<p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Hey guys,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I wanted to share our experience with windows 10 1607 computers upgrading to windows 10 1703. Basically after talking much with microsoft they proposed a fix that actually worked. However its not an enterprise fix just yet as its manual but at least it works.
 For us we have missed the deadline of being able to rollback to 1607 because there is a stupid 10 day limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Here's what you have to do .</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; 1</strong>.&nbsp;Please do the clean boot on the affected machine.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Follow the article to do clean boot:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete the user profile from the location C:\user\(useraccount)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
3.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; 3</strong>.&nbsp;Also delete the user registry of save it with .bak format at location: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\current version\Profile list\&lt;user SID&gt;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Following these steps after rebooting will allow you to log into the machine as a different user.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, qhdevon43_ .</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no user profile / registry key to delete: I tried to create a new user and Windows failed to create the users profile upon first login attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I replaced the "Default" profile with a copy from another machine, I was able to login as that new user just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow the "Default" profile got corrupted on two of my systems, but I was able to fix it by replacing
c:\Users\Default</span>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>tomblue78, I think I have the same problem as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I have another Windows 10 laptop which I have not allowed to update, and on which I can still create a user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you explain a bit more about the xcopy - if I copy the default user files from my other laptop, can I just log in to the faulty one as an administrator and overwrite the default user files? Or do I need to use this xcopy command? (If so, how would
 I do that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
