    <title>usb hdd not initialized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jan forrest  say:</h3>
<h2>            usb hdd not initialized</h2>
                    My problem is much the same as most of the ones using variations of the above problem: The external SATA USB drive on my system will not initialize or show up in My Computer. There may be hints in the following history.<br />
<br />
My No.1 laptop was way too long in the tooth and had started to experience overheating of the North/South bridge causing full system crashes and shutdowns if required to work hard. I partially fixed this by removing the cover over the offending chips, adding
 a large heat sink (with heat sink grease) and even putting a mains powered fan blowing up into the casing. However the old thing was getting slower and slower despite a complete reload of Windows XP, so just before Christmas 2011 I bought No. 2 laptop - a
 new Asus X54H with all the bells &amp; whistles and other trimmings that come with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Things were going just fine until just before Christmas 2012 when one of the dogs jogged my elbow causing me to spill half a glass of cola over the keyboard of No. 2 laptop. Despite immediately shutting it down, turning it on end and placing it on a radiator
 for a couple of days there wasn't a flicker of life from it. I took it to a local computer repairer where, although it powered up, there was no other signs of life so I left it for a report. It turns out that the cola had severely corroded many of the tracks
 on the motherboard making the whole computer an uneconomical repair. While waiting for the insurance payout I bought the current No. 3 laptop, an Asus K52JK, and transferred the single 4GB RAM stick from No. 2 laptop along with another 4GB stick to give 8GB.
 In the meantime I'd also obtained a USB HDD case to put this laptop's 750GB HDD in and got it working quite nicely with No. 1 laptop which I'd brought out of retirement to fill the gap while the newest laptop arrived.<br />
<br />
However the overheating got worse and the old thing finally became way too flaky to use for all but the very lightest of computing tasks such as checking email or surfing t'interweb. It is this which I believe caused the original problems with the 750GB drive
 as it wouldn't show up correctly when I added it to No. 3 laptop, nor would another USB HDD (only 250GB this time). After a while Windows reported a problem with the smaller HDD and requested permission to fix it. I gave it the go ahead and, over several days,
 it actually got the drive working perfectly again - albeit with a loss of perhaps 10% of the data on it. Fortunately there was little of any great value lost and I was able to reload much of it with newer and better versions, so all was not lost. After a few
 more days Windows requested permission to fix the larger drive which I was happy to give as there was literally nothing of interest on the drive since it had been the C: drive on laptop No.2 with a second partition for data, none of which was relevant to its
 current situation. After a week or so the app was chugging along quite nicely - if ever so slowly - when we had an area power blackout and the damn machine decided to shut down the app: likely to save battery power.<br />
<br />
Since then I cannot see the drive in My Computer, cannot initialize it in Disk Management, do a CHKDSK in Command Prompt using 'elevated mode' or even assign it a letter in Diskpart despite the last 3 being able to see the drive as being present. Only Disk
 Management seems to have a bash at sorting out the problem, but always comes back with a 'CRC Error' which I first put down to the drive being set to Read Only. After a few more tries with various apps I got the drive into Read/Write mode again, but I still
 get the CRC Error every time I try DM which reports that it isn't initialized - as do all the others apps. I've tried several third party fix-it apps (including Microsoft Fix-It) with no detectable results. Unfortunately I had upgraded to Windows 8 for a while,
 but it crashed so hard that I had to reload Windows 7 again and download again my copy of Windows 8, whch I haven't installed yet as I would like to see the big HDD working first. The crash had completely screwed up the disk's filing system so that it had
 to be completely wiped and new partitions set on it, but at least I've got 2 drives working - the 500 GB internal and one 250 GB external, but the loss of the big 750 GB drive means that I've only got half the storage space I've paid for and I really need
 that kind of cash at the moment to keep my cars on the road.<br />
<br />
I will continue to check out the recommendations for fixes of this nature while I await specific responses to my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>If these external drives are ones from a PC you have installed in an external case, use those HD makers free disk checking utilities to see what they report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS If cola did that to the laptop imagine what it does for you :)</p>
<p>PPS cola like many such drinks has a hi sugar content and is very syrupy when dried, if spilled over electrical items it often requires that those items are washed with distilled water in order to remove the residue and have any chance of recovering the
 item.</p>

            The CRC error is serious.<br />
I don't know if this is feasible for you, but I would connect it directly to a service computer (not by USB), and would try to initialize it that way.&nbsp; You could also try checking SMART data using Speedfan or another utility and using the drive manufacturers
 diagnostic utility.<br />
Most likely, there is a hardware failure.<br />

            SpeedFan report:<br />
<br />
<div>Almost every EIDE or SATA hard disk includes S.M.A.R.T. data. That information is collected by the drive itself and contains data that the manufacturer considered relevant to check reliability. The data is made up of several attributes that have a current
 value, a worst one, a threshold, some raw data, and some flags. Basically, when any attribute's current value is below its threshold, the hard disk is considered unreliable and likely to fail. By using several techniques, this report tries to give a wider
 range of information, basing its analysis on advanced comparisons with <i>normal</i> values based on real hard disks and on expert-like checks. The final results are not to be taken as an absolute truth, but they are almost as good as a professional expert
 advice about your hard disk status.<br />
<br />
Your hard disk is a <b>WDC WD7500BPVT-80HXZT3</b> with firmware <b>01.01A01</b>.<br />
<b>NOTE:</b> a S.M.A.R.T. model for this hard disk is not available (yet). Attribute comparison has been made against standard values. New models are computed often and in the future this hard disk should take advantage of the additional crowd knowledge.<br />
<br />
Your hard disk temperature is 23C. <br />

All the attributes of your hard disk are above the S.M.A.R.T. thresholds set by the manufacturer. This is good.
<div><br />
<b>BLOCKING ISSUE :</b> your hard disk has 386 pending sectors (<b>this value is very large and your hard disk should be replaced</b>). Those are sectors that couldn't be properly read and that the hard disk logic is waiting for a write operation to try to
 remap to a spare sector (if available). According to the <i>Reallocated Sector Count</i> attribute, your hard disk seems to have available spare sectors. A simple disk surface scan won't be enough to force the remap operation. You need a read/write surface
 scan to remap the sector. The best option should be a tool that knows about what should be read from that sector so that it has some option to apply the best fix to the missing data.
<div><br />
The overall <b>fitness</b> for this drive is 0%.<br />
The overall <b>performance</b> for this drive is 97%. </div>

<br />
Any ideas about the "tool that knows about what should be read from that sector"?</div>

            Unfortunately the error report from SpeedFan on the big drive tends to indicate that one or more platter surfaces may have been physically damaged when No. 1 laptop kept falling over. The number of unreadable/unwritable sectors definitely exceeds 200.
 Oddly, despite that fact that it still works, I'm getting a similar report for the smaller USB drive although the number of suspect sectors is far lower.<br />
<br />
I'll just have to dig deep into my pocket and shell out for a new large HDD. At least prices have tumbled so that I can get a 1TB or larger for the same price or less than I paid for the 250 GB drive just a couple of years ago.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help chaps and chappesses.<br />

<h2>            Worried about hacker access to onedrive files</h2>
                    I received an e-mail from a work colleague with a link to a Purchase Order Number.&nbsp; It took me to a site that looked very similar to microsoft's one drive access page.&nbsp; I entered my email address and microsoft password into the site.&nbsp; An error was posted
 upon login and I found out a couple of days later that my colleague's email had been hacked and this had happened to other colleagues.&nbsp; I have changed the password on my account and I have checked the login activity on my account.&nbsp; There were various logins
 with different IPv6 addresses.&nbsp; The first 15 digits on the address were the same in each case and I tracked the location down to my local area.&nbsp; I don't fully understand how IPv6 works but it looks like these logins were by me from my own laptop.&nbsp; It doesn't
 appear that anyone has accessed my account illegally but how sure can I be?&nbsp; I have all my personal data on my account and I am worried about this data falling into the wrong hands.&nb

            Hi,<br /><br />That looks like an Email phishing attempt. As you have changed password, you have essentially took the first action. <br /><br />Secondly, If you have some private information in your drive like Credit card numbers etc, Block all of those immidiately. You must consider your information compromised. <br /><br /><a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-online-scams-what-to-do-when-you-fall-for-an-email-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-online-s...</a><br /><br /> Disclaimer:<br />This is a non-Microsoft website which would provide accurate and safe information.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your PC may not be working correctly if your PC doesn't have the latest device drivers on it. As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers in Windows 10</a></strong> and check if it makes any difference.<br />
<br />
Update us with the result.

            Since you've already tried updating your device driver and yet the issue still persists, we suggest ensuring your monitor is calibrated correctly, refer to the instructions that came with your monitor.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026956/windows-change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change (lower) the screen resolution</a></strong> and then test if it makes any difference.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, you may also download and install the latest graphics card drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and then check if the issue still persists.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help.

<p>I've just about unlocked all the cars now and have got use to the driving in the game now. Some of my favourite cars are the Carrozza, Luciano and Livraga. The Rosewood is about one of the only ones I have yet to unlock and I think I'm going to like that
 one as well. What do you guys think of the cars in Watchdogs? Any favourites?</p>

<p>200k performace car, forget what it's called. &nbsp;Fastest car in game with blocked out back windows to stop getting shot from behind. &nbsp;I find most cars to be horrible, the slow cars seem okay physics wise and same with fast cars, but mid ranged feels so fake
 it annoys me immensely. &nbsp; I think using the inside view negates the fakeness quite a bit, although it's not good for missions or online.</p>

<p>Yea that's the Livraga 350. I unlocked the Livraga LE now as well. Both nice cars. I just finished the game before and unlocked the final 2 cars the Gambino and Rosewood which are Lucky Quinn and Defalt's cars. Both of them are nice for older style cars
 too.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what the difference is between the 350 and LE tbh. I unlocked the LE by completing 9 Online Races though.</p>

    <title>Recover Data from a Bitlocker Data drive lost as RAW space - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recover Data from a Bitlocker Data drive lost as RAW space</h2>
                    
<p>original title: MBR error? Bitlocker Data drive lost as RAW space... help me recover it? (Please...)</p>
<p>OK- I was experimenting with a dual boot system, and naively assumed that having 2 separate drives would protect my Windows 7 system from any problems. All was well for a while- though I had to make some changes to the bios and boot into AHCI mode instead
 of IDE, which meant a tiny registry change... I managed to get Win7 to boot with ACHI just fine, though something happened to my D: drive, (data) and it's now only showing as RAW space- it was a Bitlocker protected drive, so something has gone wrong with the
 MBR or partitioning tables or something. I need some way to recover the files from within the Bitlocker partition... (need to SEE the bitlocker partition again might help)</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated- I'm having a terrible run of luck with computers at the moment!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance... =)</p>
<p>[I tried logging this with a proper Microsoft support query, but it kept saying "network error, try later" when entering my serial number... Do they offer any free support for legit users of Win7?]</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Recent Files - Set to &#34;local files only&#34; - Performance Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are using SharePoint 2013 onprem and told our users to use "Open with Explorer" instead of the buggy sync client to work with SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Win10 we have the problem, that the users that follow our suggestion, have a hard time if they open the Windows Explorer. It freezes for about 1 minute (sometimes more) and then proceeds. Most of them are remote workers</p>
<p>As we found out it has to do with all the files they opened via WebDAV from SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround we disabled the view of the recent files. Which makes some users unhappy.</p>
<p>Is there a switch where i can limit these files to "local files" or to stop the check if the file is available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Stephan</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your response. But as this is the WebDav protocol it could be any other destination.</p>
<p>So it is more a Win10 related problem than SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards</p>

    <title>WdNisSvc problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tgreenly  say:</h3>
<h2>            WdNisSvc problem</h2>
                    Frequently windows freezes up for 20 to 30 seconds , having run task manager it always shows that it is WdNisSvc which is taking up all the memory and I believe is causing the freeze. Is this something new or am I on the wrong track?

            That is the Windows Defender service.
<br />Do you have any other firewall or virus program running on your system like Norton or Mcafee?
<br />If so either run one or the other not both.
<br />Defender does not play nice with other programs.
<br />Personally I just use Defender on all my machines and no other virus\firewall program.

            Disable it for now and see if that helps.
<br />In latest feature update of windows 10 is when defender started getting temperamental.

<h3> meenal kamalakar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Lid doesn&#39;t close properly, without a one finger space gap gap and Speakers aren&#39;t responding.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got my Surface Book 2 few weeks ago and its been just 4 days i have unboxed and started using it. Initially opening the lid was having some resistance but after some tries it was smooth, Problem arises now a days while closing it. The lid doesn't
 stay in contact with the base, there is always a finger gap between them as if the magnet has lost its strength. No matter how many times i close it properly, it pops up and creates the gap. What should i do to get it closed properly, isn't it manufacturing
 defect? Please assist me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speakers were working all fine yesterday as i tried playing video for the first time. Today all of sudden, neither a Youtube video is loaded on internet explorer plays(error is shown all of sudden) and playing Youtube on chrome-&nbsp; No matter what i played
 i couldnt hear any sound- checked all possible sound settings, I'm unable to figure out the problem. Please assist me through this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been just four days and i cant believe I'm facing these issues. Please guide me step by step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Meenal K.</p>

            Yes, there is a lot of demand for either moving to old Skype or upgrade new Skype to match old Skype. Skype is expected to roll out new features at a faster rate and sooner or later, it would become better than new Skype 
<br />
<br />This is a temporary pain period for all Skype users. This is for better future.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers by following below help -

            Split view is only in the classic version, you will have to install that, which you can still use until September 1st 2018, but you will eventually have to upgrade:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
change the value of <strong>EnableLua </strong>to 1 and change <strong>ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
</strong>to 5, to get the default UAC settings.<br />
<br />
I can't say why the slide is still broken. I only found the KB article. This is something MS should fix.<br />

<h2>            How to stop Windows 10 update from re-installing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me how to stop certain windows 10 update from re-installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have HP zbook G5 with docking station, after windows doing the update, sometimes when I press power button from docking station, for some reason the notebook doesn't start up, so I have to press power again to power off and power on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I check which device driver is install/updated during windows update?, since when I click on windows update history only list windows update only, it doesn't list which device driver is updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that windows update the device driver anyway even I set do not update device driver from system properties on control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past when I uninstall certain windows update on windows 10, next time I re-start, it re-install the update again, unlike windows 7 I can set to hide that particular update, then it won't re-install next time windows update is run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start noticing this power issue from docking station after KB4480966</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hi Hkusumo, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It's possible to prevent a certain update from installing by using the Show or Hide Updates Tool.
<br />
<br />You can find instructions on how to use it, as well as a download link here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/307393...</a>
<br />
<br />You should be able to prevent the particular update from automatically reinstalling by using the tool. Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<h2>            Xbox One won&#39;t update or install any of my games even after factory reset</h2>
                    <p>SO let's talk about the worst thing ever. Recently my xbox one suddenly decided to stop updating games. At first I thought it must be my internet. But after resetting time and time again nothing happened. To be more clear. My games will sometimes get to like 6% percent and then I'll see my download speed slowly dropped to 0. Nothing I do AND TRUST ME I did everything. I even have tge xbox support guys confused as they are literally out of ideas. So I figured a factory reset has to fix this.....it didn't. Idk if my asus router is bugged or if my xbox one is bugged but I'm leaning towards my xbox being bugged because even when I Directly connected my xbox to my router nothing changed. This is really upsetting and if you have ANY idea's please help&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>However it sounds like their installer file is corrupted, I'd try downloading it again.&nbsp; Or save it to your desktop, then right-click it and choose 'troubleshoot compatibility'.</p>

Hi,<br />
Did not work, the apps troubleshooter says I am not connected to the internet, how is this possible when I am typing this. When I am disconnected it does say I am not connected, then I reconnect and here we are. So when I try to download my app, it says it
 is pending, also I seem to not get any windows update again, maybe this is the problem. I'll try to do the optional updates again. Thanks for your help. Or if you have another option, please send it to me.
