After resolving your problem with the System Restore method suggested by TrekDozer, consider for a moment the risks of giving your child the one and only key to your house. Very risky. You have, of course, a

<h3> lplettie  say:</h3>
<h2>            MP3 tags specifically the &#34;&#35;&#34; tags are not correct</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with MP3 tags, specifically the "#" tag, in Windows </p>
<p>After getting a new&nbsp;computer, with the Windows 7 OS, I noticed a problem with my MP3 player playing the tracks of my audiobooks out of order.&nbsp; When I investigated this problem I found that the "#" tags... the track number tags... were not correct.&nbsp; It my
 help if I&nbsp;explained how I tag these files originally in MP3Tag.&nbsp; I have MP3Tag take the "#" tag and place it before the "ALBUM" tag to create the "TITLE" tag.&nbsp; Here's an example:</p>
<p>The "ALBUM" tag is "Gone With the Wind".</p>
<p>The "#" tag is generated by MP3Tag by sequentially numbering the individual files in their proper order.&nbsp; For this example let's say the "#" tag reads "09".</p>
<p>MP3Tag joins the "#" field and the "ALBUM" field to create the "TITLE" tag... in this example "09 Gone With the Wind".</p>
<p>While investigating I discovered, via Windows Explorer,&nbsp;that all the "TITLE" tags were properly numbered.&nbsp; The "#" tags, however,&nbsp;were NOT properly numbered.&nbsp; They were listed in this order:&nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19,
 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 38, 39, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 32, 33 ......</p>
<p>Do not forget that this "#" tag was used to generate the numbered section of the "TITLE" tag.</p>
<p>Now is when things may get confusing.&nbsp; Via my network I viewed the exact same folder via a machine running Windows XP.&nbsp; Viewed from XP everything was as it should be.&nbsp; I find the same behavior no matter what OS originally was used to create the tags.&nbsp; Windows
 Explorer&nbsp;shows no problems when the files are viewed from XP... no matter whether they were created under XP, Vista or 7.</p>
<p>By now I was suspecting the problem was a Windows 7 problem so I loaded an audiobook, that had not been playing back in the proper order, onto my player from a machine running Windows XP.&nbsp; The tracks played back in the proper order.&nbsp; Just to verify I dumped
 the player and reloaded the same audiobook via a Windows 7 machine and again they played bck improperly with respect to the track order.</p>
<p>This was getting intriguing so I loaded the exact same files onto the player using my netbook running Windows 7 Starter.&nbsp; They would not play back in the proper order.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; No matter whether the files were created under Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 they would not play back in the proper order if they were loaded onto the player using a computer running Windows 7.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; No matter whether the files were created under Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 they would play back in the proper order if they were loaded onto the player using a computer running Windows XP.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Two different machines running Windows 7 were used to load the player and neither time would the files play back in the proper order.</p>
<p>I believe I have a workaround for this situation but I have not completely tested it out yet.&nbsp; It seems that if have MP3Tag number the tracks using the 001/245&nbsp;format (file 001 of a total of 245 files) everything&nbsp;APPEARS to work. correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm somewhat disappointed.&nbsp; Vista wasn't much of an operating system but&nbsp;I had higher hopes for Windows 7.&nbsp; Life is&nbsp;tough... it's tougher when you've got to use a bug-ridden OS.</p>
<p>One last note.&nbsp; Before you blame MP3Tag for the problem I have noted the same behavior in files tagged using a different method.</p>

<p>In Windows Explorer I'm simply viewing the files and their associated tags.</p>
<p>I generate the numerical field of the TITLE using the TRACK # assigned by MP3Tag.&nbsp; I do this because I've found a few players that sort according to the TITLE tag.&nbsp; Ideally the number in the TITLE tag and the TRACK # tag are identical since the TITLE is
 generated, in part, from the TRACK #.</p>
<p>When I view the files in Windows Explorer, in Windows 7,&nbsp;some files have different TITLE and TAG # numbers which should be impossible because the TRACK # is used to generate the TITLE number.&nbsp; When I view those same files from a Windows XP machine the files
 are correct.</p>
<p>Sorting is dicey at best becasue, as I showed in my original post, more than one file will be assigned the same TAG #.</p>
<p>This would be so much easier to comprehend if I could simply attach a few screen captures.</p>
<p>As far as duplicate tags... I have no idea but I doubt it.&nbsp; The files load and perform correctly if loaded via a XP machine or even a VISTA machine.&nbsp;The crux of the matter is that even though the files are correct... as I've verified from Windows XP... Windows
 7 somehow FUBARs the TRACK # tag.&nbsp; Even passing the files through a Windows 7 machine on their way to the player is enough to FUBAR the TRACK #.&nbsp; Windows 7 writes the tags correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can pull those exact same files back off the player and reload them via
 an XP machine and all is well.&nbsp; I can produce the files in Windows 7 and load them via an XP machine and all is well.&nbsp;I assure you that not all of the confusion comes from my inability to describe the problem.&nbsp; It makes no sense at all yet I've verified all
 this information MANY times.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue. It can be easily recreated by simply numbering the "Track" tag using MP3Tag or WinAmp or something similar to "010". The Windows 7 "#" column then displays "8". If you tag the track number with "10" (without the leading zero)
 then the "#" column in Windows will display "10". This only occurs with ID3v2 because&nbsp;I believe you can't put a leading "0" in ID3v1 as it saves it as a numerical value whereas I believe ID3v2 saves it as a text value.
</p>
<p>The problem&nbsp;can be overcome by putting some text after the number like "010 / 300" (for instance if there were 300 tracks in total). I've uploaded some pictures of the strange problem.</p>

<p>Picture 1 is of the strange "#" value Windows 7 displays when you use a zero-padded 3 digit number. (Peculiar numbers highlighted.)</p>
<p>Picture 2 shows the normal values in MP3Tag.</p>
<p>Pictures 3, 4 and 5 show that it's not MP3Tag that's lying - These pictures are taken from WinAmp. It makes no difference if you remove the ID3v1 tags by the way.</p>
<p>Picture 6 shows the PC information on which I'm experiencing the problem.</p>
<p>Just to recap - If you tag the "Track Number" with 3 (or more)&nbsp;digit numbers padded with leading zeroes in ID3v2 then the early numbers will be screwed up in Windows 7 64 bit explorer in the "#" column. 2 digit numbers are fine. It may occur in the 32 bit
 version but I don't have a copy to try.</p>
<p>I hope this is of help</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

I don't really see why the leading zeroes are necessary. Can't you just leave them out?<br />

            <p>Hi Tim.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>To be honest, the leading zeros in the Track-Number tag probably aren't required - it's just that they are automatically generated by MP3Tag from the file name,&nbsp;but the leading zeros ARE required in the file name because otherwise&nbsp;my parents&nbsp;MP3 player (and
 I guess&nbsp;plenty others too)&nbsp;will sort the numbers as 1,10,100,11,12...18,19,2,20,200,21 etc. I'd have to manually change the numbers or mess around with a script to un-pad them. (Most of my audio books&nbsp;have 200-300 tracks, and I even have one with over 1000
 tracks, so it would be a bit of a pain to fiddle them.)</p>
<p>It's really not much of a problem for me if truth be told, although if I put my MP3 player into MTP mode instead of MSC mode, Windows 7 transfers the tracks in that very weird order and then they play in that weird order. I guess it would be nice just to
 iron out the bug too. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks again Tim.</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>
<p>From Mike.</p>

Mp3tag is pretty powerful, it can automatically remove the leading zeroes too. See<br />

I'll try to reproduce the issue in Explorer on my Windows 7 system. If it seems like a bug, I'll try to report it to Microsoft. But such small issues generally don't get fixed with hotfixes or service packs, so you would likely only see the fix in the next
 Windows version.<br />

            It appears that when a track number is 3 or more digits in length and there is a leading zero then the track number is being treated as an octal number. So if track # contains "0010" this is being treated as an octal number which converted to decimal is
 8 (when displayed by explorer in Windows 7).

            <blockquote>It appears that when a track number is 3 or more digits in length and there is a leading zero then the track number is being treated as an octal number. So if track # contains "0010" this is being treated as an octal number
 which converted to decimal is 8 (when displayed by explorer in Windows 7).

<p>I've just encountered this issue, and having read this post, it all makes sense now, why track numbers in Windows 7 file Explorer don't match the tags I've appended to the files themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have to say it mystifies me why Microsoft are seriously expecting users to use a "work-around" for an obvious error in Windows Explorer? ("remove the leading zero's", seriously?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not just fix the bug, and release a new KB article; it's not like it's difficult to fix, a one line change...</p>

            Hey Scorpion,
<br />
<br />If you are certain it works on 1803 instead of 1809, you should go back to the previous version of Windows 10 (1803) since that is the current stable version. They have pulled 1809 due to issues with data loss and such.
<br />
<br />If you are within the grace period, hit Windows key + I to go into Windows Settings, then navigate to Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery (left pane) &gt; Go back to the previous version of Windows (Get started).
<br />
<br />Hope this'll get your Bluetooth dongle to work again. Let me know if I could be of more help and good luck.       
        </p>

<p>I've gone through all of those steps and still can't get anything to pair with the csr 4.0. Not sure what the 1809 update did but it may be the new security features.</p>

<br />That would be nice indeed, but unfortunately that's the way they're going these days. You would have to use a utility like WUShowHide to prevent a certain update from installing: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/318392...</a>

<p>Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>I have no other ideas unfortunately, but please check what happens if you disable and re-enable the device. Since I had a built-in Broadcom Bluetooth in my HP 2560p I had to disable that device in order to fully use the features of CSR dongle.</p>
<p>Also, I have heard that some USB slots have different power supply therefore the CSR 4.0 best works if used in a directly -powered slot (such as one that is always ON (for charging for example) - any chance you have an USB 3.0 slot? - Sorry, not too techy

<p>Thanks to everyone that replied to this post,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I got the CSR 4.0 to work in Windows 10 1803 build 17134.407.</p>
<p>While I'm not sure how it works now this is how I did it. The first thing I did was to remove windows 10 1809 and start over by reinstalling 1803, After installing all devices and drivers for my hardware and all updates for 1803 only I installed the CSR
 stack driver software (from the CD) and turned on Discovery only and left it on Laptop even though I'm using a Desktop and installed the software with the adapter installed. After The software was installed I tried to pair my keyboard and it did not work???
 It paired it but I could not use it just like before in 1809, now I thinking the 1809 update somehow put the whammy on the adapter... pissed off I removed the software using the disc and reinstalled it with the adapter installed paired the keyboard and WHoooooo!
 it worked and worked again and I'm using it to type this reply.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Backup and Restore Win 10 to Win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup and Restore Win 10 to Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describing the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I have updated to Windows 10 I have created a back up for my <strong>Win 8.1</strong> created on
<strong>28/07/2015</strong>. After my " impulsive upgrade" to <strong>windows 10 &nbsp;(29/07/2015)</strong>, I have checked if that back up is still there, it was there, however after a month it has disappeared (possibly that it was deleted by the system when I
 was running cleaning maintenance's), and I am currently engaging with multiple bugs and what not, that prevent me from doing various things on my PC which I would normally do. This is why I would like to recover back to
<strong>Win 8.1</strong> but, I do not wish to lose my personal files as I do not have access to a removable Memory disk with 1T on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last recovery option it gives me is for the <strong>31/07/2015</strong> after my update to
<strong>Win 10</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My Question in short how can I recover back to <strong>Win 8.1</strong>, <strong>
a</strong><strong>nd not lose all my personal data.</strong></p>

                    I accidentally removed (not deleted) all of&nbsp;my files from the music library.&nbsp; I am unable to locate them on my PC anywhere. I've tried to restore the folder, and the files are not located in the recycle bin either. Cannot seem to find a solution in the
 help section. I am looking for a way to recover these files.

<p>Hi Ronnie</p>
<p>Yes, i was talking about the default&nbsp;Music library Folder (My Music)&nbsp;in the Windows Explorer Library.&nbsp;Thats what i accidently removed. Only folder thats visible is the default folder (Public Music). I restored the actual "folder", but all 4,500 songs are
 gone.</p>
<p>I was attempting to copy my music file from my pc (via usb)&nbsp;to my Android's (phone) sd card. While in the Windows Explorer Library, underneath the words "Music Library"&nbsp;were the words "Includes: 2 locations", so i clicked on "2 locations", &amp; a box appeared
 which said, "Music Library Locations", &amp; "Change how this library gathers its contents".</p>
<p>In this box were the 2 locations "Public Music &amp; My Music", with "Add &amp; Remove" buttons to the right of the box. Well i highlighted "My Music" &amp; moved my hand to push my dog's nose away, &amp; accidentally hit the remove button.</p>
<p>Now when i go to the Windows Explorer&nbsp;library, there are&nbsp;no songs at all. All 4,500 of them are gone. where there used to be 2 locations in my Music Library, there's now only&nbsp;one (Public Music,) which was always empty. Is there any hope or chance of me retrieving
 this lost folder, or file?</p>
<p>Any help/advice that you can give or offer, will be greatly appreciated............Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Marcus</p>
<p>The Libraries are virtual folders. They do not contain any actual files or data.</p>
<p>The only thing they do is mirror the contents of&nbsp;other physical folders that are located in various other locations on the hard drive or remote locations.</p>
<p>You can Delete a file from a library and this will delete the physical file from the physical location. However, when you use the Remove Button to remove a folder that was added to a library, this has no effect on the physical folder or the files it contains.</p>
<p>If you go to C:\Users\your name\My Music, you should find all of the music&nbsp;files in that folder, intact.</p>
<p>Let us know what you find.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Windows Update 80244019 error when manually checking for updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaxim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update 80244019 error when manually checking for updates</h2>
                    <p>I get a 80244019 error on my Windows 8.1 computer when I attempt to manually "check for updates".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background: Windows Update told me I had 8 optional updates, so I installed them. At some point later in the day, I manually checked for updates and received the&nbsp;80244019 error. I thought something had happened and Windows Updates was now hosed. I uninstalled
 the optional updates and attempted a few things but I kept getting the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours go by and I checked Windows Update again and those 8 optional updates are indicated to being available. So is automatic update working but manual update not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the main Windows Update screen where it is telling me that I have 8 available optional updates, it says that the "Most recent check for updates" is "Never" and "Updates were installed" on "Never". This seems curious since I have checked and installed
 updated before today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Today I didn't do much on my computer other than updating Java and installing VirtualBox from&nbsp;https://www.virtualbox.org/. Of course, I am unsure when exactly this problem started since I don't usually try to manually check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I updated the 8 optional updates, the "Updates were installed" field was set to "Today at 10:30PM"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One other curious thing that happened was that the "Installed On" column is missing from the Add/Remove Programs window ("Programs and Features"). In its place is a "Date Modified" column. I right click on the heading row, select "more..." and check "Installed
 On" and uncheck&nbsp;"Date Modified". The columns look fine now, but when I restart the computer, the&nbsp;"Installed On" column is missing and the&nbsp;"Date Modified" column is there again. Is this related?</p>
<p>

<p>I am having trouble using Edge and the&nbsp;responses in BUG link&nbsp;that you provided&nbsp;is not in English.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am having the same 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 problem.&nbsp; I upgraded my&nbsp;Windows 7 Ultimate&nbsp;64 bit AMD system to Windows 10 Pro in August of 2015.&nbsp; It upgraded all the way to 1511 (OS Build 10586.753) without&nbsp;any problems.&nbsp; I have been trying to install the Anniversary
 upgrade since August 2016 without any&nbsp;result.&nbsp;&nbsp; I re-installed the November 2015 and April 2016 releases and all the intermediate patches over the existing system.&nbsp; I am doing a clean boot, disabling all non-MS services and startup items and&nbsp;I have turned
 off&nbsp;all of the non-MS tasks.&nbsp; I uninstalled&nbsp;my anti-virus and malware software.&nbsp; I increased my mbr area to 750 MB.</p>
<p>I have managed to clean up almost all of the errors but the upgrade still fails with the following:</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to windows 8 64bit, from xp 32 bit. Guidance needed.</h2>
                    Hi, I am running xp 32 bit and have few questions.<br />
<br />
(1) While using upgrade assistant, will I be given options to choose between 32 and 64 bit installer ?<br />
(2) Because my current is 32 bit xp, if want to install win8 clean in a separate drive. Will I be able to do that with facility of dual booting to both xp and 8 ?<br />
(3) If a clean install can be done, then how will I need to activate it, Will online activation be sufficient or I will need to call by phone ? (if need to reinstall due to HDD failure/corrupts in future I will have to call MS support every time ?)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Welcome to Microsoft Community!!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are trying to install Windows 8 64 bit operating system on 32 bit operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please take a backup of all important data before you install.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(1) While using upgrade assistant, will I be given options to choose between 32 and 64 bit installer ?</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to inform you that, we cannot upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit OS through the Windows Upgrade Assistant.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, but you can't do this using Upgrade Assistant. If your PC has a 64-bit capable processor (CPU) but is currently running
 a 32-bit version of Windows, you can install a 64-bit version of Windows 8, but you'll need to buy Windows 8 as a DVD.</span></p>
<p><span>You also won't be able to keep any files, settings, or apps when you upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit version.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8#section_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8#section_2</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
(2) Because my current is 32 bit xp, if want to install win8 clean in a separate drive. Will I be able to do that with facility of dual booting to both xp and 8 ?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
If your system meets the Windows 8 System Requirement then you can install Windows 8 on separate driver.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with support for PAE, NX, and SSE2.<br />
RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit).<br />
Hard disk space: 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit).<br />
Graphics card: Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(3) If a clean install can be done, then how will I need to activate it, Will online activation be sufficient or I will
 need to call by phone ? (if need to reinstall due to HDD failure/corrupts in future I will have to call MS support every time ?)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
We can windows 8 using Online activation.</span></p>

            <p>There is another solution to buying the DVD. If you run the Windows 8 installer from a PC or laptop with a 64-bit operating system, you can save a 64-bit version of the ISO file. Double click on the ISO file to create a bootable install DVD. Insert the 64-bit
 Windows 8 install&nbsp;DVD in your 32-bit PC or laptop and then reboot the PC or laptop. Assuming your BIOS is set to boot from the DVD, the Windows 8 install should automatically. If not, you may need to go into your BIOS settings to change the boot sequence to
 your DVD first.</p>
<p>During the Windows 8 install, I recommend that you go to the advanced settings to remove all the partitions on the hard drive and then click on the New icon to create a single partition. This ensures that you don't have any unnecessary RESERVED partitions
 left over fron the previous&nbsp;operating system.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the elaborate reply, thats very helpful.</p>
<p>And I wanted to ask something again:</p>
<p>(1) Will MS provide the feature/link to choose between 64bit &amp; 32 bit&nbsp;upgrade installer download&nbsp;in future im MS Store ? So that I can download the 64 bit installer later ?</p>
<p>(2) Is it ok to get the 64 installer from others, as Martin says there&nbsp;..... I mean when Upgrade Assistant is giving me 32 bit installer, then does it not mean that I am buying 32 bit upgrade, not 64 bit upgrade ? Are the Installer .iso files&nbsp;freely distributable
 ? And my product key purchased in 32 bit system will work with that 64 bit installer ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry, I don't really prefer the DVD ordering option. It may take days, may be 1-2 weeks to reach me.</p>

Thanks Martin for your reply, thats good information to know. My system is very much 64 bit capable,&nbsp;though i don't have a 64 bit os. Windows 8 is what I am looking forward to for this. So, will have to get the .iso from others if thats ok with MS.</p>

            <p>Hi Vijin, it would be nice for Microsoft to give the option of downloading and installing a 64-bit or 32-bit version of the operating system. However when you think about it, most people don't even know what&nbsp;operating system version they are running or whether
 their machine is&nbsp;64-bit capable.&nbsp; If Microsoft gave people the option of choosing the operating system version, you'd have some peope selecting 64-bit when they only have a 32-bit capable processor. Microsoft errs on the side of caution by assuming that if
 you're running the Windows installer on a computer that has a 32-bit version of Windows, that you want to install the 32-bit version of Windows 8.</p>
<p>The ideal would be if Microsoft gave you the option of selecting 32-bit or 64-bit only in the scenario where&nbsp;you are running a 32-bit operating system on a 64-bit capable machine.</p>

If we do what is said above, do we have to buy separate key for&nbsp;64 bit&nbsp;or will Product Key be the same as 32 bit?</p>

<p>Olá henrikneves,</p>
<p>
</p><p>É comum isso acontecer na ausência de conexão com a internet, porém quando a conexão se restabelece, os saves ficam disponíveis novamente.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desligue o console, desconecte-o da tomada por 10 minutos, ligue-o novamente, acesse as configurações e teste sua conexão de rede. Se o teste apresentar resultado normal, tente acessar os saves do jogo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Espero que isso o ajude.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Hello Henrikneves,</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is common for this to happen in the absence of Internet connection, but when the connection is restored, the saves are available again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turn off the console, disconnect it from the socket for 10 minutes, reconnect it, access the settings, and test your network connection. If the test shows normal results, try to access the game saves.</strong></p>

<p>Hey Henrik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. Just as our great ambassador Italo mentioned, as long as you were connected online you should be able to access your saves. In case they don't immediately resync, you can try removing and re-adding your account by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;to open the guide. </li><li>
Select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Account </strong>
&gt;<strong> Remove accounts</strong>. </li><li>
Select the account that you want to remove, and then select <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm.
</li><li>
When you're finished, select <strong>Close</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps! :D</p>

<p>Hi Henrik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you are signed into the correct profile that has the data saved to it? Also as mentioned previously, were you at any point playing offline? If the data was corrupted and its not loading then playing offline will not save the data to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you haven't done so already go ahead and uninstall the game, restart your Xbox and power cycle it by removing the power cable, then re-install the game once the Xbox restarts.</p>

            Hi Medreda, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, sorry to hear about your problem. I've got Fortnite and I experienced the same problem.  It's a known fault by the Epic company with there latest 5.0 update.  They won't say what's wrong but have provided users with a solution.  It worked for me, fingers crossed it works for you too. 
<br />
<br />The fix to the error, for now, is as follows:
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\BattlEye
<br />Click the Uninstall_BattlEye.bat file (Windows Batch File)
<br />Click the Install_BattlEye.bat file (Windows Batch File)

    <title>Disable scroll feature on HP Pavilion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> princesspc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable scroll feature on HP Pavilion</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to disable the scroll feature on my touchpad. I have an HP Pavilion. There is a forum to disable the scroll feature, but it is for Dell computers. Does anyone know how to disable this on a HP Pavilion? This feature has really been slowing me
 down when I am trying to do my school work. I have been turning off my touchpad, but turining my touchpad on and off gets really annoying.</p>

<p><span>Hi deva_noah,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you updated the latest drivers for your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue screen errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues, and it can be difficult to troubleshoot the problem at times. Check to
 see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Run Memory Diagnostics test to check for any
 memory problems. Refer the below mentioned link for the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Diagnosing memory
 problems on your computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Update the chipset, video card, display and
 network adapter drivers to the latest by visiting the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver for hardware that

<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers: recommended links</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if the issue occurs in safe mode.
 To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 the arrow keys to choose Safe mode in the Windows Advanced Boot Menu Options and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 if you can open the desktop icons, if not, then it could be some third party application that is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Restart the computer in normal mode and follow
 the below mentioned article to find the cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup
 once you are done.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer the below mentioned link for more information.</span></strong></p>

            HI,  
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Clear browsing history.
<br />
<br />3. Run the SFC scan 
<br />Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how: 
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc /scannow and then press Enter.  
<br />3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk 
<br />    and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.  
<br />4. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair and reset the app: 
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, and select Settings. 
<br />Select App, click on Microsoft Edge from the list, and select Advanced options. 
<br />Select Repair. 
<br />If the issue persists, repeat the steps and select Reset. 
<br />
<br />If, all the procedures above didn't work, please try to reset  Edge manually:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Edge doesn’t open, try resetting the browser manually.
<br />Press Windows key + R and type: C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages.
<br />
<br />Open the folder labeled Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe and delete all of its content.
<br />
<br />Then, 
<br />1. click Start and type: power shell and right-click Power Shell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />2. Run this command will reinstall Microsoft Edge: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />The command result will appear in the PowerShell window. Exit PowerShell, then try launching Edge again.
<br />
<br />I hope it works,
<br />
<br />Regards. 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

            Hi,
<br />First step would be to try re-registering Edge:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/reinstall-Microsoft-edge-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/reinsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, Windows 10 version 1709(Build 16299) provides a repair option for Edge too:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Apps and Features&gt;Microsoft Edge and click Advanced
<br />Click on Repair button on the screen. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, try creating a new User account:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5464-delete-user-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5464-delete...</a>

<p>I explained on the phone exactly what I wanted to accomplish. I have had microsoft technical support access my pc. There was no discussion about host or client. The included picture is on Windows 10 home pc. Is this my imagination?</p>

<p>The snapshot you posted says nothing about Windows Home or Professional. The fact remains that only the host (= the machine that you wish to control remotely) needs Windows Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - using a digital camera to take screen shots is stone age technology. Why not use the inbuilt snippingtool.exe? It is much, much easier to use!</p>

            HI,<br />
<br />
You were told right.<br />
<br />
You can receive (be a client)&nbsp;or remotely access (&nbsp;with Windows 10 Pro.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Home you can only receive (be a client).<br />

<p>Thanks for all your help. The fact remains that :-</p>
<ol>
<li>i could not access my remote radio station server in the clouds.</li><li>I was told, by Microsoft, that i could only achieve this with windows 10 pro.</li><li>With the help of a friend I learned that i could do this with windows 10 home.</li></ol>
<p>Be as technical as you wish.</p>
<p>As stated above, Microsoft did not help me. They wanted me to spend unnecessarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no computer whiz. So suggesting that my photo is a fake, is on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now understand how things can be, so I will seek technical support elsewhere.</p>

<p>Please re-read my reply. I never wrote that your picture was fake. I wrote that it does not reveal anything about Windows Home or Professional. I also said that you used a stone-age tool to create this snapshot, thus making life
 hard for yourself. Why use nail scissors to cut the lawn when you have a lawnmower in the garage?</p>

<h2>            Gadgets won&#39;t display properly in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original title: Gadget Problem</strong></p>
<p>When I try to select gadgets certain ones won't display properly. For example, only the "close box" outside of the weather icon displays, and the calender only shows an orange outline. I think there is some sort of glitch, does anybody know how to fix this
 problem?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you use any third party gadgets?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try resetting the sidebar to default settings and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> By resetting to the default settings, you’ll have to add your gadgets
 back to the sidebar.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>First
 make sure that the sidebar process is completely closed</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
 on the Sidebar icon in the system tray, and then choose Exit.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Check
 in Task Manager to make sure that there are no sidebar.exe processes running. If there are, just right-click and use End Process on each of them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 up a windows explorer window and then paste the following into the location bar: %localappdata%\microsoft\Windows Sidebar</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>This
 will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Rename
 Settings.ini folder. This file contains your current sidebar configuration.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 start and open windows sidebar, you’ll notice that a new Settings.ini is created in the above mentioned folder immediately.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Windows
 side bar now should work with minimum gadgets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 may add the gadgets manually and check if it is working.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the link “Windows Sidebar and gadgets”</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to create a new user account and check whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below to create a new user account.</span></span></p>
