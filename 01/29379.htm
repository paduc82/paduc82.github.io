<h2>            Ethernet connection issues in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Unidentified Network - No Network / Ethernet - Limited</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built my computer about a year ago, and I've only ever used wifi with it. I finally got an ethernet cord connected, but it doesn't seem to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0631aca-54b6-4db5-b8d7-fcdc4051f276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0631aca-54b6-4db5-b8d7-fcdc4051f276" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>Resetting my IP via the Command Prompt 'netsh' reset.</p>
<p>Updating my network driver.</p>
<p>Resetting both my computer and my router (numerous times, trying different variations, like disconnecting the two, then resetting them, then reconnecting them).</p>
<p>And Network Troubleshoot, which provides me with an "Ethernet doesn't have a valid IP configuration -- Not fixed" message.</p>

Hi Arida,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I am following up with the manufacturer, but they are also not able to diagnoise the problem and rectify it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, checking out with the forum if someone has gone through&nbsp;this earlier and&nbsp;understand solutions for resolving the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot save downloads</h2>
                    I have not been able to save downloads in either windows explorer or firefox or even from a DVD that came with a computer magazine. Or maybe I have but can't access them. In firefox the file seems to download but when it is finished I can't open it from
 the download window. When I right click on the file the open option is greyed out. When I close the window I can't find the downloaded file again. Please help.<br />

            Hello napstar13,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.<br />
<br />
<p><span>If you don't specify where you want the file to be stored, Internet Explorer will normally try to put a file in the most appropriate place. For example, documents and webpages are normally saved
 to the Documents folder, music files to the Music folder, and images and graphics are saved to the Pictures folder.&nbsp;Files that may be considered harmful such as&nbsp;executable programs, are saved to the temporary Internet files folder first, then copied to the
 folder you've specified.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b><span>To find a file you have downloaded</span></b></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open your personal folder by clicking the Start button
, and then clicking your user name at the top of the Start menu's right pane.</span>
</li><li><span>Double-click one of the following folders:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Downloads</span>
</li><li><span>Documents 
</span></li><li><span>Pictures</span>
</li><li><span>Videos</span>
</li><li><span>Music</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If you do not see the file you are looking for, but know its file name, you can search for it by following these steps:</span></p>
<p><b><span>To search for a file you have downloaded</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the Start button
.</span> </li><li><span>Type all or part of the file name into the Search box. The file you are looking for should appear in the list of search results.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you are still having a problem, then try doing a clean boot and see if a third party program or software may be interfering with the downloads. In a&nbsp;clean boot the computer is booted with a
</span><span>minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following KB article for steps on clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Everytime I click on a link in an email I get the following message:</p>
<p>"This operation has been cancelled due to due to restriction in effect on this computer. pleas e contact your administrator"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only administrator is me as this is a home laptop.</p>
<p>I have tried evrything I can think of to fix this issue with no success.</p>
<p>I have looked in the registry and tried the <em>
gpedit.msc </em>none of which work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started after windows updated and I am sure there must be a corrupt file somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a fix for this issue I would be grateful if someone could point me in the right dirrection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Trish</p>

<p>Thank you for your response but I have already tried setting up a new account as administrator but still no joy. I'm sure this is something to do with a MS upgrade either for office or win 10. (Most likely office)</p>

    <title>IPV6 has internet while IPV4 says no internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valodyjean-baptiste  say:</h3>
<h2>            IPV6 has internet while IPV4 says no internet</h2>
                    <p>Ok to keep this short, my computer loses IPV4 connectivity every so often while my IPV6 stays intact.
</p>
<p>(Ipv4 : no internet access.&nbsp; *sometimes says "no network access"</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ipv6 : internet )</p>
<p>The only way I have found to temporarily fix this is by using cmd and doing a DNS flsuh.<br />
But like I said it is only temporary and the issue still comes back. <br />
I would like a more permanent solution.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to note, I have all my drivers updated, the issue happens on some modems but never on others (of the same brand) so Im not sure if its a modem config issue or an issue on my pc.
<br />
Im using the typical black (vertical) **** modem from comcast. ( I tried with 2 of the same modems (roommate had another from comcast) , same settings. Issue happens on 1 of them all the time and never on the other, which i think is weird)</p>

            <p>Hi ValodyJean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried connecting another computer to the same network or modem? Is it not allowing you to go online both wired and wireless?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to run Network Troubleshooter for Windows 7, see the screenshot below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Click on Start &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e51c25fa-136a-495b-853e-869e2f26f0a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e51c25fa-136a-495b-853e-869e2f26f0a0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, it might be the settings with your router/modem if that is the case you would need to get in touch with your Internet Service Provider.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly Mark as Answer if this post answers your query. Let us know how it goes.

            I have indeed tried connecting another computer to that same router and the other computer works just fine.<br />
I even tried copying all of the internet settings with the exception of the ip address and it still didn't work.<br />
I run the troubleshooter but all it says is the connection between you and your router is broken, please unplug your router etc...<br />
Even when I restart the router it does the same thing.<br />

            <p>It shows that there is no problem with the router or network since you can connect to the internet using other computer. We would suggest to contact your manufacturer to further check on this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, umberto1.<br />
<br />
When you put the SD card back into the camera, can you see the photos in the camera? Many cameras come with cables for a direct connection to a computer; does your camera have such a connection?<br />
<br />
If you give us some details, such as makes and models of camera and computer, we may be able to guide you.<br />
<br />

<p>RC, the camera is a Kodak P712.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I put the SD in the camera I can see the actual photos, all of them&nbsp;- so I know the jpegs are there and still intact.&nbsp; But after short while the camera-reviewing freezes and&nbsp;I have to remove the SD from the camera to
 get it unfrozen.&nbsp; I have to find the direct connect cable to see if I can copy them to Win 7 that way.&nbsp; More info on trying to open the files in Win 7 - When&nbsp;I put the SD into a reader slot in the computer Windows Explorer will give me a listing of the files
 with dates, etc.&nbsp; However, if I try doing anything with one of those files, like open or Properties, Windows Explorer freezes and will unfreeze only if I remove the SD.&nbsp; Same thing with Windows Live Photo Gallery.</p>

<p>Hi, umberto1.</p>
<p>We need to know about your camera AND your computer - especially the SD reader in your computer.&nbsp; Is the card reader built-in?&nbsp; Or connected by USB?&nbsp; Or what?</p>
<p>It sounds like you might have a hardware problem with the connection between your csrd reader and your motherboard.&nbsp; Since this is a new computer, you should take it back to where you bought it BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRES!</p>

<h2>            Need 25 character product key for Dungeon Siege game</h2>
                    I bought Dungeon Siege about 6 years ago. Since then I have lost the case and all info for loading the game. I also bought a new computer recently and when I try to load my game it asks for a 25 character product number. Does anyone know where I can get
 this info?<br />

<p>Just move at the fastest pace the game allows, meaning -- move at the character's pace -- and don't try to skip any sections by being fancy, like jumping a corner early and wall-running over wall mounts you should be connecting with.</p>
<p>Because if you skip a wall mount or platform, you'll skip the design and end up falling from a place you shouldn't have been.</p>
<p>When your only option is to drop down to a ledge, drop down, every single wall mount, ledge, grapple hook, and wall run is designed specifically to be recognised and used - if you use each and every one, you'll reach the top without incident.</p>
<p>Emphasis: There isn't a single part of that section that is there as an option to be ignored... it is all there to be used. {XD</p>

<p>thanks. I finally made it by quickly jumping to wall soon as possible and then not jumping till I reached end of runs, I hate this part more than any game I have ever played. very tedious and hate4d watching the cut screen over and over.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro 104Key PS2&#47;USB Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows pro 7 and it will not recognize this keyboard at all, also the Intellimouse explorer is not recognized either.&nbsp; I know both of these are older but they work just as well now as when I bought them.&nbsp; The reason I want to use the Keyboard
 is because it has the 2 USB ports built into it.&nbsp; In order to write this I am having to use the basic dell keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mouse is more responsive than the newer one I tried.&nbsp; When I click with it bang it goes just have no way to program it in Windows
 7 pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Ideas or help would be appreciated.&nbsp; I don't want to toss something that is still servicable.</p>

            <p>Ok before I even put this question out there I tried all of those possible solutions.&nbsp; All of the above solutions do not work for the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro.&nbsp; You connect it to your computer with the PS/2 Port and the USB port connection.&nbsp; This keyboard
 has 2 built in USB connections on the back of the keyboard too.&nbsp; Microsoft in windows 7 has no solution what so ever.&nbsp; It only needs the driver that is usable for windows 7 and x64 computers.&nbsp; It works just fine on any computer that has xp home, pro or any
 of the earlier windows programs.&nbsp; I have checked the PS/2 connector and it is fine it works for any plain keyboard and they system I have is a dell precision with 2 dual core 3 ghz processors.&nbsp; It has the intel chipsets and everything else does work and will
 recognize everything else as a server should.&nbsp; Those articles just don't go above 32bit to 64 bit for the keyboard.</p>

    <title>Cannot Access Network Folder Shortcuts - Windows 7 64Bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dam_89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Access Network Folder Shortcuts - Windows 7 64Bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my Network folder shortcuts under the Network location tab of My Computer refused me access. When i click on a network folder a messsage pops up saying "network error" " Windows cannot access \\Synology_nas\ ******" It is the same for all my network
 folders. " Error Code: 0x80070035, The network path was not found" The folders are shortcuts to two different NAS drives and have been working great for over three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the NAS drives via their IP address on the PC, through my ipad app, android app and can access the shares on my network tv's in my home etc, all give access except the PC. Usually under the network tab, the NAS would be displayed and if i were
 to create a new network folder it would display as usual. However not anymore, the network tab shows nothing underneath but if i click on it, devices are listed under, Media Devices, Network Infrastructure, Other Devices and Storage. The IP address's of the
 NAS drives are correct and all good on their end, as i said i can access them from any where except the PC. The PC is connected to the network via a switch as always. The workgroup names are the same. This is really doing my head in trying to figure this out
 and why the PC will not give access, network adapter is working great and running newest drivers etc but i cant find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded a short Video to make things more clear :&nbsp;https://youtu.be/Ye5VE1fyPQw</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help will be highly appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

THIS LINK</a>&nbsp;. I completely uninstalled my network adapter and downloaded again from intel's website. And thankfully it worked, i let out an almighty cheer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, thinking back over the last few days, i have come to the conclusion that the most likely reason for the problem in the first place was " Driver Detective " while usually good, in this case it must of installed the wrong driver for my adapter. Hope this
 helps someone in future.</p>

 one minute and find it a minute or less later?</p>
</div>
The logic that is being used in the geolocation process is flawed. I connect to 888NJPoker then login and if verified I can play online poker. The software rechecks with the initial geolocation routine. If that or a subsequent recheck is unable to verify I
 am in New Jersey it doesn't mean I am not in New Jersey. I have proven that many times by exiting and getting verified for cash play in less than a minute. As in a FALSE negative. The ONLY reason a player should be removed from play after an initial successful
 login, daily or for 24 hours, is if the geoloaction sofware detects the player's location is NOT IN NEW Jersey.</div>
I've emailed and spoken to&nbsp; 888support innumerable times and I haven't received a solution as to&nbsp; how to end the constant geolocation failure messages."

            <p>The only way they can get your location outside of a GPS reading from an app is to you use your ISP IP address. When you get&nbsp;removed look at a site like speedtest.net where it will look at your ISP&nbsp;IPs location. It is also sounds like it is using the near
 by wifi networks location which isn't a very good way to do it because it can easily show in a different state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember what the ipconfig command is to see all local wifi. But, you can use type in
<strong>tracert bing.com </strong>in a command prompt to see where you ip traffic is bouncing to see if it is get tossed out of state
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Top see local wifi use the command <strong>netsh wlan show networks mode=BSSID</strong></p>

    <title>External hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zacpeters1  say:</h3>
<h2>            External hard drive</h2>
                    I bought a Seagate external drive a few weeks ago, with 2tb storage, and got it formatted and downloaded several games and it worked just fine for a while. At one point it started giving me trouble where none of my games would start so I did a factory
 soft reset and that fixed it for a while. Now though when I try to download a new game it wants to download to my internal storage and it wants me to clear space. Also if I play a game that I have downloaded it plays just fine, but when im done and try to
 watch netflix or something its starts giving me the something went wrong error and I have to hard reset the console for anything after that to work. This happens every time. What should I do?

<p>Hello Zac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here on the Xbox forums. Easiest thing to resolve this issue is changing the USB cable to your External. This can fix a lot of weird, unexplainable issues that occur with hard drives on the Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that reformatting the hard drive is an option, but id recommend changing the cable first if possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do your games and apps (Internal) have any issues launching when your external is unplugged?</p>

<p>Hi ZacPeters1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any games on your internal storage?&nbsp; Because even though you have an external hard drive you have to have a certain amount of free space in your internal storage.&nbsp; If you do, I recommend transferring some of those games from your internal storage
 to your external drive.</p>

            Okay so Ive sort of tried doing that but instead of transferring games Ive just tried uninstalling a few but it doesnt seem to help. I guess my issue with that is that I dont know how to tell what games are installed to my internal and/or external
 drives since they all just show up in the games section on my xbox. How do I tell where theyre installed to?&nbsp;

<p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; Please try powercycling the console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds till it shuts down.&nbsp; While it's off you can unplug the external drive and plug it into a different USB port.&nbsp; Perhaps that will work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for seeing what's on the drive you can go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage.&nbsp; Choose the device you want to see and press the A button.&nbsp; Select the option to View Contents.&nbsp; You should be able to move them from there as well if need be.</p>

            Have you already tried going into your Storage settings to make your Seagate external HDD the default storage for when you download new games? You can set your internal or external to be the default, and it should download all new games etc straight to
 that. I would double check that, and that might be one reason why it keeps downloading to your internal.&nbsp;

</p><blockquote>Okay so Ive sort of tried doing that but instead of transferring games Ive just tried uninstalling a few but it doesnt seem to help. I guess my issue with that is that I dont know how to tell what games
 are installed to my internal and/or external drives since they all just show up in the games section on my xbox. How do I tell where theyre installed to?&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the game details it should tell you if it is stored to Internal or external media.&nbsp; Try unplugging the drive and using netflix and see if the error occurs.&nbsp; If it does without the external drive connected, you probably have an issue with either
 the app(s) itself or something internal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AS other said if it works fine unplugged, you may want to try another external USB cable, there can be ones that don't function properly with USB 3.0 which could cause potential issues.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 not recognizing NVIDIA graphics adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roygrubb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 not recognizing NVIDIA graphics adapter</h2>
                    <div>I just installed 64-bit Windows 8 Pro OEM (clean install) and it won't properly recognize my graphics adapter. &nbsp;When I installed Win8, it automatically installed the BasicDisplay.sys driver dated 6/21/2006! 6.2.9200.16384 (win8_rtm.120725-1247).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The graphics adapter is based on the GeForce 9400GT chipset, and worked fine in Windows XP. The motherboard is an MSI G41M-P33 Combo with Intel CoreDuo 6600 CPU. &nbsp;The PC is a generic box, bought locally and its mobo failed recently, so I replaced it with
 the G41M. &nbsp;As MS doesn't let you re-activate with a different mobo, I installed Win8, which works except for OpenGL, which happens to be needed by the software I want to test in Win 8. &nbsp;Other than that the graphics look OK.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Via the Control Panel, I can see that the Adapter is recognized as NVIDIA, but the driver remains stuck at Microsoft Basic Display Adapter no matter what I try.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Display &gt; Screen Resolution &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Adapter shows:</div>
<div>Adapter Type: Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</div>
<div>Chip Type: NVIDIA</div>
<div>DAC Type: NVIDIA Corporation</div>
<div>Bios Information: G27 Board - p381n17</div>
<div>Total Available Graphics Memory: 256 MB</div>
<div>Dedicated Video Memory: 0 MB &nbsp;(In fact the adapter has 512MB on-board video memory.)</div>
<div>System Video Memory: 0 MB</div>
<div>Shared System Memory: 256 MB</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have tried so far:</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;I have updated the BIOS and all mobo drivers, but that didn't solve the problem. &nbsp;Verified up to date with both Driver Reviver and MSI (mobo maker) Live Update 5. &nbsp;Both showed need to update several at start and none after updates made.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. At the NVIDIA site, the "Option 2: Automatically find drivers for my NVIDIA products." function said "The NVIDIA Smart Scan was unable to evaluate your system hardware. Please use Option 1 to manually find drivers for your NVIDIA products."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. So I downloaded 306.97-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-international-whql.exe, which lists 9400 GT under supported products, but when I run it, it says:</div>
<div>"NVIDIA Installer cannot continue</div>
<div>This graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried the following, with the same result:</div>
<div>306.97-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-english-whql.exe</div>
<div>304.79-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-english-beta.exe</div>
<div>296.17-desktop-win8-32bit-english-preview.exe</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. I connected the display to the on-board Intel graphics (G41), removed the NVIDIA card and rebooted. &nbsp;Again it installs the MS Basic Display Adapter, and can't properly run my s/w that needs OpenGL. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. Shut down PC and pulled out power cord.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Held start button to discharge all capacitors in power supply.</div>
<div>Removed and re-inserted NVIDIA adapter in PCI-E slot.</div>
<div>Made sure properly seated.</div>
<div>Connected the monitor to the card, screwed plug to socket.</div>
<div>Reconnected power cord. Started and checked in BIOS that Primary Graphics Adapter was set to PCI-E.</div>
<div>Started Windows.</div>
<div>Uninstalled MS Basic Display Adapter in Device Manager. &nbsp;Screen blanks, reappears. &nbsp;No Graphics adapter visible in Device Manager.</div>
<div>Restarted PC. &nbsp;MS Basic Display Adapter Visible again in Device Manager.</div>
<div>Clicked in Device Manager &gt; View &gt; Show hidden devices.</div>
<div>No other graphics adapter appears.</div>
<div>Rebooted.</div>
<div>Tried Scan for Hardware changes.</div>
<div>Tried right-click on MS Basic Display Adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Driver &gt; Update Driver... Search automatically. &nbsp;It replied that it had determined driver was up to date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. Checked that there were no graphic driver-related entries in Programs and Features that I could delete (none)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>7. Did a Windows Update.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>8. Ran GPU-Z which shows (main items):</div>
<div>Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</div>
<div>GPU G72</div>
<div>BIOS 5.72.22.76.88</div>
<div>Device ID 10DE - 01D5</div>
<div>DDR2 &nbsp;Bus Width 32 Bit</div>
<div>Memory size 64MB</div>
<div>Driver Version nvlddmkm 6.2.9200.16384 (ForceWare 0.00) / Win8 64</div>
<div>NVIDIA SLI Unknown</div>
<div>in the drop-down at the foot, "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" is the only option</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm out of ideas for new things to try and would be really grateful of suggestions.</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before going to the display driver issue, I want to tell you that you can activate Windows on different motherboards. All you need to do is to inform Microsoft that the MB needs a replacement and so request for a license transfer and you can&nbsp;activate Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming to the display driver issue, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>Go to start-&gt;type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press enter. In the Device Manager window, expand
<strong>Display Adaptors</strong>, you'll find <strong>NVIDIA GeForce 9400&nbsp;GT</strong>. Double click it, the propertoies window will open. In the properties window, go to Drivers tab and click
<strong>Uninstall. </strong>Click Yes if a warning pops and also check <strong>Also delete driver software for the device,
</strong>if prompted<strong>.</strong> Now the device will be uninstalled and the driver will also be removed. Now, open 306.97-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-international-whql.exe and proceed with the installation. It'll install the latest driver for the
 device. After installation, restart your PC. If it does not solve the issue, unistall the driver as mentioned above, restart the PC and then try installing the drivers, and againg restart the PC.</p>

Thanks for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>On the first point, I tried to reactivate online, but failed, and the activation process gave me a Microsoft phone number to call. &nbsp;When I called that, I was told by someone
<b><i>at Microsoft</i></b> that a mobo replacement prevented me from reactivating the XP license. &nbsp;I had never heard that before.
<div><br />
<div>On the second, no, NVIDIA GeForce 9400 GT never appears in Device Manager. <b>
Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</b>&nbsp;is the only entry under <b>Display Adapters</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In 5. above, I mentioned:</div>
<div>
<div>"Uninstalled MS Basic Display Adapter in Device Manager. &nbsp;Screen blanks, reappears. &nbsp;<i>No Graphics adapter visible in Device Manager.</i></div>
<div>Restarted PC. &nbsp;MS Basic Display Adapter Visible again in Device Manager.</div>
<div>Clicked in Device Manager &gt; View &gt; Show hidden devices.</div>
<div><i>No other graphics adapter appears</i>."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other suggestions, please?</div>

            <p>Does your motherboard has any other type of display adaptor like nVidia, on-board (of course, can be low performance adaptor&nbsp;than the card)? If so, you may have to try installing driver for that device first, and then try with nVidia drivers. It should detect
 the card in this case.</p>

            <div>Thanks Balaji.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is an on-board Intel Express graphics adapter, which I had previously disabled in the BIOS. &nbsp;On your suggestion, I enabled it again, so the PCI-e adapter (NVIDIA) adapter is disabled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After rebooting, Display &gt; Screen Resolution &gt; Advanced settings shows:</div>
<div>Adapter Type: Intel(R) G41 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1)</div>
<div>Chip type: Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family</div>
<div>DAC Type: Internal</div>
<div>Adapter String: Intel(R) GMA 4500</div>
<div>BIOS Information: Intel Video BIOS</div>
<div>Total Available Graphics Memory: 814MB</div>
<div>Dedicated Video Memory: 64MB</div>
<div>System Video Memory: 0MB</div>
<div>Shared System Memory: 750MB</div>
<div><br />
<div>And Display &gt; Screen Resolution &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Adapter Type &gt; Properties &gt; Driver shows:</div>
<div>Driver Provider: Intel Corporation</div>
<div>Driver Date: 3/24/2012</div>
<div>Driver Version: 8.15.10.2702</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Search Automatically for updated driver software" says "The best driver software for your device is already installed". &nbsp;I tried letting it search c: and subfolders as well, with the same result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After that, under Display adapters, Device Manager shows Intel(R) G41 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1) and Selecting View &gt; Show hidden devices shows Microsoft Basic Display Adapter as well, grayed out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are no other graphics adapters and no yellow question mark devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next, I rebooted and switched BIOS back to PCI-e. &nbsp;The result is as before:</div>
<div>Under Display adapters, Device Manager shows Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and trying to update it shows it's up to date (it's still the 2006 driver). &nbsp;Why is it using a 2006 driver on Windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then in Device Manager, I did Show hidden devices and this time Intel(R) G41 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1) is visible, grayed out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried Scan for hardware changes on the Display Adapter. No message appeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I right clicked on the Intel G41 adapter and the MS Basic Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and selected Uninstall for each. &nbsp;Display Adapters disappeared in Device Manager. &nbsp;I did Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes and Display Adapters plus MS Basic Microsoft
 Basic Display Adapter re-appeared in Device Manager, but not the Intel device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it's back to the original state.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I noticed that when using the on-board graphics, the exact model of the monitor (Philips 170S) is recognized. &nbsp;When using the NVIDIA card it just reports the monitor as a generic PnP monitor. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And the Intel graphics driver does not support OpenGL, either. &nbsp;Under WinXP and Win7, Intel Express on-board graphics usually supports OpenGL.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Something else: Just to eliminate one other possibility, I tested the NVIDIA graphics card in another PC - one running Win7 - and found it's working normally. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Roy</div>

            I have now looked for separate patches but cannot find any, so I have raised a technical support ticket with MSi to see if they can help. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've described the whole problem as above, and have asked about separate Windows 8 patches explicitly.
<div><br />
<div>Meanwhile, just for the record, I also tried clearing the CMOS and re-setting BIOS values to see if that made a difference, but it didn't.&nbsp;</div>

            At least yours appears to be able to see the graphics adapter! &nbsp;Mine doesn't recognize it as NVIDIA in Device Manager, and even NVIDIA's own driver installer can't see it.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>as far as I know the 2 player Split screen option in Forza Motorsport 6 is only available in the Free play option.</p>
<p>See this link for the steps mentioned in the forza forums: <a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postst94612_split-screen-with-forza-6.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable splitscreen on Forza 6 on Xbox. Go to the main menu. From the main menu go into Free Play.<span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>You'll then see an option for Player 2 to press the Menu button, which enables Split-Screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>

<h2>            The Better of the bike games</h2>
                    
<p>Which is the better bike game for a novice rider, MotoGP 10/11 or SBK 2011. I find it hard to stay on the track a lot of the time so if I purchase one of these I don't want one that will throw me off at every corner LOL.</p>

<p>I found the SBK X demo one, which I found the bikes easier to handle than on MOTOGP 11 So I assume the SBK 10/11 will be the better option for me.

<p>It's been out for ages, I've seen it in quite a few shops and for a good price, usually under 20. If you have an Asda try there my store always has a copy in.</p>
