<h2>            Recent Update Broke My PC&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a new poster and not particularly as well inclined to the workings of Microsoft as some of you are. I recently updated my Microsoft OS and selected shut down after update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon returning to my PC the following day I found that after I restarted the PC it took a few moments the finalize then took me to the, "select a keyboard" phase where I selected "UK".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am then presented with 4 options</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Continue</p>
<p>- Use another OS</p>
<p>- Troubleshoot</p>
<p>- Turn off your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Continue" Reboots my PC and sends me through the same process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use another OS" offers me a desktop that is completely inaccessible even on previous version saying something about a hard drive issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Troubleshoot" tells me to acquire the OS on a different PC then plug it back into my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone please shed some light on what may have happened and how to fix?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>
<p />

            Unfortunately, you will have to perform a new install. This appears to be a serious bug many are encountering with the new version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hey Mack.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please know that MVP's are pressing Microsoft harder now on these disastrous version Upgrades. After you're back up and running, you can also complain to developers in Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where they are tasked to process Consumer feedback, but they will not even see it here as this is a tech forums where volunteers try to solve your problems.
<br />
<br />In cases similar to yours which we're escalating right now, that Rollback screen you're getting doesn't seem to even apply here since nothing on it works, it may be a legacy screen interfering with the actual Go Back to old Version needed here.
<br />
<br />To test this create the bootable media which is always the most stable method for repairs anyway, to try to Go back to Old Version. If it fails then you can try the Reset or use the media to Clean Install with our help. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More Options, then Go back.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot options to try Reset. 
<br />
<br />At any time you can also access via Advanced Troubleshoot Options the Command Prompt to try to rescue any files you don't have backed up properly.  Look under C:\Users or C:\windows.old.  Here's how to copy them out:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If all else fails proceed with the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Close out repairs and try Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  AMack95, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, your best and probably only option is to roll back to version 1709
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

    <title>Unable to connect to XP workstation via Remote Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect to XP workstation via Remote Desktop</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot solve this issue for the life of me.</p>
<p>I am an experienced IT professional and need assistance in fixing this painful problem.</p>
<p>Windows XP Pro SP3, all of the latest windows updates installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one particular workstation that is incapable of being connected to via remote desktop.&nbsp; This happens when using the RDP client from any computer.&nbsp; After typing in the IP or hostname it immediately results in the error message " This
 computer can't connect to the remote computer.&nbsp; Try connecting again.&nbsp; If the problem continues, contact the owner of the remote computer or your network administrator."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after each time an attempted RDP connection is initiated and failed the following event ID posts in the source computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event ID 1036 </li><li>Description: Terminal Server session creation failed. The relevant status code was 0xC0000037.
</li></ul>
Please note that this user was able to connect to their workstation with no problems until a week or so ago.&nbsp;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked over the dozens of common causes.&nbsp; I've also searched the web endlessly with no successful fixes.&nbsp; I will not list everything I have tried but I will list a few</p>
<ul>
<li>Throw the workstation in an OU that blocks all group policy inheritance </li><li>Turn off Windows firewall and other security software </li><li>Verify all appropriate services are enabled to accept incoming connections </li><li>Verify DNS, network, and routing is working appropriately </li><li>Restarted the workstation multiple times </li><li>Update the video card drivers </li><li>Reviewing of any relevant event logs </li><li>Confirmed that TermService and DcomLaunch are sharing the 3389 port.&nbsp; But this seems to be common with all XP Pro installations.
</li></ul>
Any help would greatly be appreciated as I am feeling quite hopeless.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The error message you are getting is basically pointing towards Port 3389 not working on the XP Client machine.</p>
<p>Please check in Device Manager-&gt;Show Hidden Devices, where you've all the RDP Services started, if not then please start them.</p>
<p>You should also check if the port number 3389 is specified correctly in registry editor or not.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Wds\rdpwd\Tds\tcp</p>
<p>Also, you can try to merge these 3 keys from a healthy WinXP Sp3 machine:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\TermDD</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, please get Termdd.sys from a healthy machine and replace it on this machine in safe mode[WFP Disabled].</p>

            I know this is an old post but just wanted to say thanks.&nbsp; I 've been researching this on the net for a few days already with no results.&nbsp; Registry entries were configured with port 5555 for some reason.&nbsp; Changed back to 3389 and now works like a charm.<br />

    <title>Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Installation Keeps Failing&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Installation Keeps Failing&#33;</h2>
                    Paid for Windows 8 Pro Upgrade this morning, used the upgrade manager, tried a clean install through the installer  it failed. Tried again, but instead tried to keep files  settings. Failed again. I tried again  again probably 10 times,  it fails every time. Got to 70% at one point, got my hopes up, and failed again. No explaination, no error msg, just "Installation has failed". So i tried booting it from a DVD, tried many MANY times,  it just won't install. 



What the **** is going on? I paid for this ****  it won't even work. My laptop is definitely compatible, I have my product key, and i've spent LONG frustrating hours trying everything I could think of to get it working, but it just won't.  



What can I do? Can anyone help? If not, I want my money back.

            <p>Like you guys, I have spent hours on this since 8pm last night.</p>
<p>Purchased Win 8 Upg, toshiba laptop, Win 7 Pro.</p>
<p>Win 8 upgrade program would not remove all the incompatible products so I had to stop the isntallation and remove them manually.</p>
<p>Once that is done you cannot get the install to run again you have purchase the product.</p>
<p>I have receipt, order number and Product Key. Really, Really, Really annoyed.</p>
<p>I want my time back Microsoft. How do you restart the install program (2GB file) that was downloaded? I cannot find it anywhere.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me where the 2GB file is or where it went once decompressed so maybe I can still recover wtih the same key before.</p>
<p>I called the support number anyway and it was answered by Windows 8 Upgrade support team.</p>
<p>They lead me to this siite&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mswos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mswos.com/</a>&nbsp;where you will need to enter all of your order details. Once done you will sign in and have the option to download a setup installer file.</p>
<p>Done that and I am in the process of re-installing now at 9:22am. </p>
<p>Thank you Microsoft, I take back some of my comments.</p>

            I got this problem too. I ordered Windows 8 Pro. I have all the requirements in fact I have the Consumer preview already on board. I try to install this and then when it goes to the final step where it says install it doesn't even get to 1% before it tells
 me installation failed. Is it because I didn't uninstall the programs that were not compatible?

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I had been to Laptop Dealer shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him for MS Office 2019 Original License For Life Time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He showed me the following card of Microsoft. </p>
<p>Front &amp; Back side image of the card is embedded below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8df74f9e-c9a6-4656-98eb-227cb8fc7d9f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8df74f9e-c9a6-4656-98eb-227cb8fc7d9f?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/803ef69f-4ff2-4300-8e7b-43af178ef35b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/803ef69f-4ff2-4300-8e7b-43af178ef35b?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
I asked him for Box Pack CD. He said CD is not there. Further I asked then how do you get the Key. He said Key is below the silver tape. Scratch the silver tape &amp; Key will be visible.
</p>
<p>Silver tape is above the Bar code in the 2nd image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know whether it is valid Microsoft Product to buy.</p>
<p>If it is a valid product, then what is the right process to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please explain me the meaning of </p>
<p>"Once the source of the License is Legit" </p>
<p>&amp; how to ensure it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please let me know what is the right way to get the Product Key (Paper License) of Windows 10 Pro Full Pack Retail version from the 3rd Party Retailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested in buying Genuine Valid Windows 10 Pro &amp; MS Office Paper License.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the required guidelines for same.</p>

<br />
<br />That all looks to be perfect, that is the way Office . . . etc. now is delivered, there is no CD/DVD, the actual applications are downloaded as I explained above . .. 
<br />
<br />When I mentioned legit, what I meant by that is there are a lot of sellers online, selling volume licences, which are not the full legal licence . ..

When I mentioned legit, what I meant by that is there are a lot of sellers online, selling volume licences, which are not the full legal licence . ..
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noted the things in your message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been duped earlier by the seller in selling me the ingenuine volume license in place of original OEM license for Windows. I came to know after one year, when it got deactivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a couple of days, new seller is going to install new Windows 10 Pro Full Retail Version in my laptop.</p>
<p>I told him that after installation, I will check with Microsoft online chat to ensure it is a genuine Product. If Microsoft confirms it is genuine, only then I will make a payment for it.
</p>
<p>He agreed for same. Further he said, he will bring Box Pack CD, will open the box in front of me &amp; the key will be found inside the Box Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make sure that this time I get the genuine Windows Product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With best regards</p>
<p>Raju&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for posting your query&nbsp;in Microsoft Community. We understand the inconvenience caused and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>On a working PC, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft software download website</span></a> and&nbsp;create Windows&nbsp;10 installation media.</span></li><li><span>Insert the installation media you created, and then&nbsp;restart your PC.</span></li><li><span>On the Install Windows screen, select
<strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.&nbsp;(If youâ€™re not seeing this screen, your PC might not be set up to boot&nbsp;from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to boot&nbsp;from media, and then try
 again.) </span></li><li><span>On the Choose an option screen, select
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>. From&nbsp;there, you can use Safe Mode. Select
<strong><span>Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, select 5 or F5 to restart you&nbsp;PC in
<strong><span>Safe Mode with&nbsp;Networking</span></strong>. If your PC wonâ€™t start in Safe Mode with Networking,&nbsp;try steps 2-4 again, and then, after your PC restarts, select 3 or F3 to
<strong><span>Enable low-resolution video</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once your PC is in Safe Mode, open Device Manager by&nbsp;typing device manager in the search box on the taskbar, select Device&nbsp;Manager, and select the arrow
 to expand Display&nbsp;adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>If you see two items under Display adapters:</span></li><li><span>Right-click the added display adapter (for example,&nbsp;Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200), and then select Disable &gt; Yes. To&nbsp;see if that worked, shut down
 your PC, disconnect your installation media,&nbsp;and then turn your PC back on.</span></li><li><span>If that doesnâ€™t work, restart your PC in Safe Mode (see&nbsp;steps 2-5), return to the Display adapter section in Device Manager,&nbsp;enable the display adapter,
 and then disable the other display adapter.</span></li><li><span>If you see one item under Display adapters, roll back&nbsp;the driver or uninstall the display adapter.
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To roll back the driver, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand Display adapters. Under Display adapters, right-click the
 item and select Properties. Select the Driver tab, and then select Roll Back Driver &gt; Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To uninstall the display adapter, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand Display adapters. Under Display adapters, right-click
 the item and select Properties. Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt;OK.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - AppV application</h2>
                    <p>I've made a couple of AppV applications using InstallShield 2018 build.&nbsp; I tried both repackaging and using an ISM and using just a straight MSI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks ok and I get to fully publish but when I run the Icon I get the same message (on both an vanilla Win 10 PC and on SOE'd machine from our environment);</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142). Click OK to close the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Event viewer under Microsoft -&gt; AppV -&gt;Client -&gt; virtual Applications I get the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The virtual application 'C:\ProgramData\App-V\9FEC58F4......\A1729DBF...\Root\VFS\AppVPackageDrive\Program Files\APP....\....APP.EXE' could not be started because the App-V Subsystem 'Virtual Filesystem' could not be initialized. {error: 0x74300E0A-0x20006}</p>

    <title>&#36;WINDOWS.&#126;BT folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> promil kumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#36;WINDOWS.&#126;BT folder</h2>
                    <p>We all know MS launched Win X on 29th July, 15 &amp; updates would be rolling out further in batches, yet I have queries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After I downloaded the ISO/Bootable creator tool from MS's website it says, "Couldn't launch setup, Please Reboot." Although after reboot too I faced the same problem. What should be done ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Recently after launching that media creation tool for Win X, a folder named $WINDOWS.~BT has been created in my C partition.</p>
<p>What should I do with this folder ?<br />
Does it has anything to do with the update to be rolled out or the failed Win X setup Launch ?<br />
</p>
<p>(I am currently running Win 8.1 on my Toshiba Satelite Pro Machine which is fully compatible with Win X)</p>

            <p><span>Hi Promil,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Issues with installation are being resolved by<strong><span>disabling the Antivirus software</span></strong> and also by unplugging
 the <strong><span>external devices (Hardware Clean boot</span></strong>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to disable antivirus and test the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your
 antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Before updating, make sure you have installed all available updates to your PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also run a system file checker scan and check if there are any corrupt system files.
</span></p>
<p><span>SFC (<strong><span>System File Checker)
</span></strong>is a tool which scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>

<strong><br />
3. </strong>Check with the game maker's and forums to see if their known issues. Games can really stress a system and cause BSOD.<br />
<br />
4. Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>As needed use <strong>ALL</strong> the methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. </strong>After <strong>ALL </strong>the above if needed run DriverVerifier to&nbsp;see if it can indicate a<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
<strong>Run DriverView</strong> -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update <strong>BIOS and chipset</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do&nbsp;a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect
 as&nbsp;the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with
 these to an extreme overkill point.<br />
<br />
How do I find and remove a virus?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus</a><br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN&nbsp;it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not
 does not mean you should not check with the other methods below.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you referring to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/microsoft-phone-companion/9wzdncrfj3pm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">app</a></strong>? If yes, what exactly is happening when you tap the "Import photos
 and videos" option? Have you checked if there's an option to select the photos you just wanted to import? By the way, you may also try using the Microsoft OneDrive app and see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />

            <p>Yes, that is the app (Microsoft Phone Companion).&nbsp; When I tap the "import photos and videos into the Photos app", the default Photos app opens, and a dialogue box pops up that says "looking for new photos and videos".&nbsp; After all(?) of the images on my phone
 have been discovered, another dialogue box opens "Select items to import from", and I have the option to check, or uncheck any of the photo thumbnails to download.&nbsp; I have 1000+ images to sort through, many of them are unwanted junk that seem to be associated
 with the podcasts that I listen to.&nbsp; I wish the app would just look in my photos folder, rather than scour my entire phone for images.&nbsp; I would prefer to stay away from OneDrive, and cloud storage if possible.&nbsp; I did attempt to use the google photo cloud service
 as a work around, but when downloading them all back to my PC the day/month folder structures were lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>I deleted the contents of a folder on my phone which was filled with podcast images (I'm using podcast addict).&nbsp; I then manually deselected the remaining unwanted images (mostly app icons) during import using the 'phone companion'.&nbsp; I was able to import
 all my photos with a folder structure to my Windows 10 PC cloud free.</p>

<p>I found a SOLUTION, but it requires a USB thumb drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Plug your android phone into your computer, turn it on, unlock it..</p>
<p>-with Windows File Explorer, find your 'Camera' folder within the 'DCIM' folder on your phone and copy it to your thumb drive</p>
<p>-within the Windows Photos app, find the option to import the photos from your thumb drive, this will give you the option to keep a dated file structure, and keep unwanted images from other folders on your phone from being imported</p>

<h2>            How to get Downloads to open immediately on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I inadvertently changed a setting on Windows 10. Initially, when I received downloads with my emails or from a website I could simply open them from the bottom task bar. But I changed something and now the downloads are directed into the last folder that
 I had opened and want to be opened and saved in that location. How do I revert back to the original setting of opening from the task bar?</p>

            <p><strong>Can I uninstall Windows 10 if I do not like it or something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can see the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back t

</p><p>Remember to always backup:</p>
<p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

    <title>Games no longer work on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anokneemous  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games no longer work on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have roughly 10 PC games that are older, heck some used DirectX 8 :-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, they all worked perfectly on Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10 here is what happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First attempt to run, it tells me I need to run it as administrator (they all do this)</p>
<p>2. I set it to run as administrator and then, nothing happens. Well I double click, I get the "app starting cursor" then nothing..</p>
<p>3. I set it to Windows 8 compatibility + run as administrator, nothing</p>
<p>4. I set it to run at 640x480, no DPI, run as admin, Windows XP / 8 / Vista oh.. the screen blinks, as if it is creating a DirectX window to actually play the game, but then it just goes back to the desktop and no errors, nothing in the event logs... Nadda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really sucks, these are some of my favorite games :-( and I was so thrilled they worked on Windows 8....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also add, just for a note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That my daughter has a copy of the games and when we would try to start them on hers (same issues) on Windows 10, except that she has PowerDVD and it's suite installed. When we set it to 640 bla bla, same as above it would give us an error saying PowerXXXX
 couldn't run in this DPI / Resolution setting.. which I tried to resolve, but realized... (or guessing) that is only does this because instead of Macro Media running the game, PowerXXX was attempting to do it (probably a mime type)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhoo. I am not even sure what to collect or how so that I can try to debug this. I guess I could run it under a debugger but I have no symbols or I guess maybe filemon / etc to see what it tries to access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I tried all the different options under troubleshooting compatibility, let it do its thing and nothing worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really a let down as I have to back out of Windows 10 now unless I can resolve this. Since they ran on Windows 8.1 Pro, just fine... I don't expect them to not work on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I even downloaded the NVIDIA Windows 10 video drivers and still the same problem. Installed DirectX 9C (because I play everquest) and so that was there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Without knowing what games you're referring to, it's impossible for anybody to help you out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suggestion I can give is to make sure you have .Net framework 2.0 and 3.0 installed.&nbsp; Windows 8 had 3.0 installed by default IIRC, but not 10.&nbsp; You can look under Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off.&nbsp; The applications
 may need some of the associated files that come with the frameworks, if not the whole frameworks themselves.&nbsp; Otherwise, that's all I can suggest, and even my suggestion is purely a shot-in-the-dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fighting my own game compatibility issues, mainly with x360ce.exe.&nbsp; It's a program that lets me use my old USB controller with games.&nbsp; It works fine under 7, but it had problems under 8 and I haven't had luck getting it to work under 10 yet.</p>

            <p>The games are actually from originally different vendors, but were sold (I bought them in Europe LOL), by Sold Out Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games like SpellForce, Might and Magic 4, Sonic etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually didn't realize that in fact the event log was giving me an error (because of the spam of some other things).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I see</p>

<p>This driver has been blocked from loading</p>

</p><p>I know in some cases this can happen with 32 bit drivers on 64 bit machines etc... However I was specifically running Windows 8.1 Pro 64-Bit Edition and Upgraded to Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, not sure why this only happens on Windows 10 (aside I know from some stricture security), but other than turning off signing validation... I have no idea how to get around this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort of dumb that it works on 8.1 Pro 64 bit but not Windows pro 10 64 bit, so clearly something changed because the game is exactly the same game.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I have roughly 10 PC games that are older, heck some used DirectX 8 :-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, they all worked perfectly on Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10 here is what happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First attempt to run, it tells me I need to run it as administrator (they all do this)</p>
<p>2. I set it to run as administrator and then, nothing happens. Well I double click, I get the "app starting cursor" then nothing..</p>
<p>3. I set it to Windows 8 compatibility + run as administrator, nothing</p>
<p>4. I set it to run at 640x480, no DPI, run as admin, Windows XP / 8 / Vista oh.. the screen blinks, as if it is creating a DirectX window to actually play the game, but then it just goes back to the desktop and no errors, nothing in the event logs... Nadda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really sucks, these are some of my favorite games :-( and I was so thrilled they worked on Windows 8....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also add, just for a note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That my daughter has a copy of the games and when we would try to start them on hers (same issues) on Windows 10, except that she has PowerDVD and it's suite installed. When we set it to 640 bla bla, same as above it would give us an error saying PowerXXXX
 couldn't run in this DPI / Resolution setting.. which I tried to resolve, but realized... (or guessing) that is only does this because instead of Macro Media running the game, PowerXXX was attempting to do it (probably a mime type)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhoo. I am not even sure what to collect or how so that I can try to debug this. I guess I could run it under a debugger but I have no symbols or I guess maybe filemon / etc to see what it tries to access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I tried all the different options under troubleshooting compatibility, let it do its thing and nothing worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really a let down as I have to back out of Windows 10 now unless I can resolve this. Since they ran on Windows 8.1 Pro, just fine... I don't expect them to not work on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I even downloaded the NVIDIA Windows 10 video drivers and still the same problem. Installed DirectX 9C (because I play everquest) and so that was there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I have the same problem as well ! All my old games like Microsoft Flight Simulator X and EA Sports does not work !</p>
<p>I hate Windows 10 - If they don't come up with a patch for this problem I am going back to windows 7 or 8 and also my printer does not work too! You think they would have had some people try this out before sending out to the public to&nbsp; buy or upgrade ?
 I though Apple was bad but I thinking of maybe going to the other side ?</p>
<p>GOOD JOB WINDOWS 10 </p>

            It's because Windows 10 no longer allows the installation of dodgy DRMs like older versions of SecuROM. So if you have older games, in a non digital format (like CDs or DVDs) with some form of DRM like SecuRom or SafeDisk, they will likely not work.

<p>The reality is that NOTHING is "Hacker Proof", fortunately Microsoft is better fortified than others to combat this ongoing nuisance, there are many preventative measures that you can take, NEVER accept 'Party Invites' from unknown gamers, this is a popular
 avenue Hackers exploit to extract an IP Address, when in a 'Party' adjust your settings to 'Invite Only', get to know people a little more in 'Game Chat' before getting too friendly with them, you really never know just who exactly is on the other end, be
 a little more careful...:-)</p>

<p>^^ Ambassadors don't have the power to delete posts/replies, only moderators do. And the comment was most likely deleted due to the fact that it was going against the Terms of Use by giving explanatory hacking suggestions, which is not permitted on the forums.</p>

<p>umm. a person with common knowledge can hack . i never actually gave a suggestion of how to hack or even a place to go to hack?. a gave a website suggestion so some people could READ UP on computers and how they work. &nbsp;and ok the moderator does not deserve
 to have that power clearly if he removed a g tag that was caught hacking. with PROOF why are we protecting him? &nbsp;next reply will be Microsoft does not protect hackers. well sorry sir but by removing his gtag you actually are. weather you think it or not.

<p>They (moderators) have no choice but to remove those said gamertags as Canadian laws states that an individual is considered innocent until proven guilty. And, "naming and shaming" other members is also considered a legal offense in the sense of profiling.
 It is simply the way law works in this country. Suspission is also not considered proof legally.</p>
<p>As for moderators not deserving such power to remove names is a non sense as it is in their job mandate to do so. They are just following directives given by their superiors.</p>

<p>Hi Raul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the package you're trying to install does not match the processor architecture of the Windows version that you are using.&nbsp;<span>For example, an x86-based update cannot be installed on x64-based installations
 of Windows. Did you check if you are installing the right architecture? To check, go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About</strong>. Also, may I know the download link to the Media Feature Pack that you are trying to install?</span></p>

<h2>            Configuring the Microsoft eHome Infrared Transceiver buttons.</h2>
                    I would like to use the Microsoft eHome Infrared Transceiver for programs other than media center, like my audacity audio editor. Is there a way to configure the buttons to do keyboard shortcuts?

<p><strong><span>Hi Philrob22,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I am afraid that the transreceiver is configured to work only with Windows Media Center and cannot be configured to work with any other non-Microsoft
 application. Also the device is configured to work according to a particular range of frequencies which cannot be changed or adjusted to meet different requirements.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

    <title>Skyrim freezing a lot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> striny258  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skyrim freezing a lot</h2>
                    
<p>My Skyrim game is freezing constantly. &nbsp;I will turn on my xbox put in skyrim, load my main character and start to play. &nbsp;After about 5 minutes of walking around or I go into a loading screen my game will freeze and it completely locks me out of my xbox.
 &nbsp;I have to turn the entire xbox off and then reset. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My xbox is not overheating which i know for a fact ( i leave it for a day, turn it on and immediately start playing skyrim then it freezes). &nbsp;I have 4 saves at the moment with autosaves turned off on my hard drive. &nbsp;I have used a completely fresh memory
 device to try and stop it if there is lag from saves. &nbsp;I have cleared my cache on my normal hard drive. &nbsp;My disk is scratch free BUT My disk had a full circle scratch after i moved the console when the disk was inside but I had it PROFESSIONALLY cleaned (
 not sure if this affects the disk). &nbsp;I have run 3 other games on my xbox perfectly normal. &nbsp;I have wiped the disk with a cloth. &nbsp;Nothing seems to work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem and how can i fix it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>well even though it was professionally cleaned, with the circle of death on the disc there's no way they can gurantee it can still read the data.</p>
<p>try installing the game to the hard drive, if it fails out wihle installing you might need to get a replacement disc.</p>

<p>Installing the game is the best option, once the Xbox has verified that the game is in the disk tray, it will just run it off of the hard drive, hopefully bypassing your issues. To do so with the game in the disc tray press Y for "game info" and select "install

<p>My Skyrim disc was damaged as well. &nbsp;Installing might help but it might not. In my case the game was able to be fully installed and it would get to the loading screen and allow me to load my save but it would also freeze at about 90% loading and I could
 never actually get into the game.</p>
<p>Installing can help but if certain areas of the disc are damaged its not a fix all as the game could fail the security checks that happen every time something loads. &nbsp;Ultimo your suggestion is somewhat correct but it does as I stated above perform the security
 check more than once, it is not just on the games first loading.</p>
<p>I suggest calling 18004myxbox and taking advantage of the disc replacement program. &nbsp;For $20 you can get a new disc sent to you in the mail after you send your damaged disc in. &nbsp;You could also try to find the game at retail and if you see a copy for less
 than $20 go that route.</p>

<p>Install the game to HDD, this should allow the disc to only be read when the game is loading. &nbsp;Failing this you will need to get a replacement disc, details of how to arrange this should be in the instruction manual that came with the game. &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

<p>i Forgot to mention that I tried to instal the game and it didn't work. &nbsp;At 14% install it said that the disk was damaged, this was after it was professionally cleaned. &nbsp;I guess that it must be the disk that is mucking up even though it has no sign of scratches
 or marks. </p>

<p>I have heard people with this issue. It has alot of things it could be though. Maybe it was Laser Burned but you cannot see it. Maybe the professional clean failed. And Or you just need to buy another game. I suggest getting insurance for better playtime.
 Thank You.</p>

<p>Hey XxSKipyxX,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let's try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing your console's cache</a>, then restart the console and try again. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you do that, start a new thread of your own here in this forum, so that we can give you individual attention. &nbsp;And this forum is fairly old.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Running a System Restore generally puts the Registry back into working order:
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
