<h2>            Speaker Shortcut Icon Won&#39;t Adjust Volume</h2>
                    <p>The speaker shortcut icon was working fine yesterday, today if you click on the icon nothing happens. The picture doesn't change to give you options of sliding&nbsp; to adjust your volume. All the other icons seem to be working just fine. I didn't purposely make
 any changes to any program or my computer that I am aware of. Now the only way to adjust the volume is to adjust from the control panel volume mixer Speaker/Headphone Realtek High Definition Audio which is more cumbersome.</p>

    <title>Disable the Bar in lower right corner that slides in and out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable the Bar in lower right corner that slides in and out</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Home Premium. There is a small bar in the lower right corner of my screen that slides in and out if my cursor touches that area. It is very annoying because I can't resize windows because the trigger tab is over the corner of the window.
 I have never seen this before this new copy of Win 7. It has choices - Auto, and then some icons of an airplane, with rollover text that says High Performance Mode, a walking figure with rollover Power Saving Mode, and a running figure that says Away Mode.
 I want to disable it and I cannot find anything on this. I have attached a screenshot. Obviously it's to do with power settings but I cannot find anything in the control panel to toggle this off. It's extremely annoying and totally useless.

<h2>            Halo&#58; Reach keeps crashing on my Xbox One S</h2>
                    
<p>I installed Halo: Reach on my Xbox One S from the Store. It will show the Xbox 360 startup animation, then the Reach loading animation, then the game crashes and kicks me to the Xbox one Home menu. I have reinstalled (both on the internal hard drive and
 on an external SSD) the game but I have the same results. The game worked fine on my original Xbox One before I got rid of it. Other 360 backwards compatible games work fine as well, only Reach is crashing. Any help is appreciated.</p>

            Today, after restarting my computer, it failed to boot so an option came up to repair disk drive or something similar to that. I did that and after about an hour the computer booted up and since then the Search Index has been working normally, among other
 small issues my computer had. Not sure what the issue was but it is resolved now. I appreciate the help.

<h2>            AMD Radeon Display following April 2018 Wondows update</h2>
                    <p>Following each major Windows update, my display driver returns to 'Microsoft Basic Display Driver', despite Devise Manager seeing my AMD Radeon HD 5700 graphics card. Following this, the image doesn't fill the whole of my screen, losing more than 1cm top
 and bottom and 2cm on each side of the screen, also the screen resolution is greatly reduced to somewhere in the 1990's, maybe even the 1980's</p>
<p>I usually lose my PC for a few days and get charged ¬£65 to have this fixed by a local company, but this is inconvenient and costly and I would like to know how to fix this myself.</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            <p>Hi, Tanel P√§m,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most OEM recovery systems for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows</a> based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
operating systems</a> involve booting from a separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CD-ROM</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DVD</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard drive</a> partition, which in turn launches the recovery environment. After accepting the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
license agreements</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
software</a> and operating system in some cases, the recovery program will usually reformat the hard drive and then begin copying operating system and software files
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution:<b> </b>Manually mount the basic volumes by assigning drive letters, or by creating mount points using Disk Management or the

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yesterday I run sfc /scannow after all Metro Tiles were gone away. As a result I could find out, that there were a lot of System files in corrupted state. Most of them I could fix. But two entries are still logged:</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could find the mentioned files&nbsp;within RSAT for Win 8&nbsp;update Windows6.2-KB2693643-x64. There are included those two manifest files. Re-installing the update didn't work for me as the corrupted files didn't get replaced correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>I took ownership for these files and granted full permission. After file replacement I removed additional permissions and gave ownership back to TrustedInstaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sfc /scannow reports now "<strong>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</strong>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for spending your time&nbsp;on trying to help me.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Basic Display Adapter doesn&#39;t go away.</h2>
                    So i have been having a problem with the microsoft basic display adapter for a while now. I do have my drivers updated for my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphic card but the microsoft basic display adapter is still there with the error code 31. I don't
 know if it is the reason that my screen freezes every once in a while, and especially when i am playing games. I am not sure how to fix it, i have updated, deleted and re-updated it so many times but it will still have an exclamation mark next to it.

            Hi FrustratedPerson_01 
<br />
<br />Is the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter listed alongside your NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti card in the Display Adapters section?
<br />
<br />If so, that would mean you also have on-board graphics as well as your Nvidia card and there is no driver loaded for that device
<br />
<br />In Device Manager, expand out the Processors section, what is the exact model of Processor listed there?       
        </p>

            The basic display adapter is a temporary driver in place so that you can still see the display after uninstalling the graphics driver.
<br />You may have two graphics card one from nVidia which you‚Äôve already updated &amp; another by either Intel or AMD, what is the make &amp; model of the PC? Is it an Intel or AMD?
<br />If intel then you can download the Intel driver updater here:
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>
<br />If AMD then please visit the device manufacturer &amp; find the graphics card driver download.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Hi FrustratedPerson_01
<br />
<br />When this happens, sometimes it is better to uninstall that driver and try an older version of the driver, which may be more compatible with your system . ..

<p>I have had contact with the makers of the pc, and so i will be sending it in for repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however tried to use an older driver, but that one also didn't work. Seemed to revert the graphic card name back to microsoft basic display adapter. So not sure what happend there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks for the help, i'll will keep it in mind if i ever have problems in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Keyboard, mouse, touchpad doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10 a few weeks ago and the backlighting for the keyboard has not worked since. I therefore updated the keyboard drivers, and then it stopped working completely.<br />
The built-in keyboard and touchpad doesn't work and it doesn't work with USB keyboard or USB mouse (except for certain macro keys, sush as volume control on the external keyboard).<br />
<br />
I don't know how to solve it since I can't enter safe mode when I start the computer and&nbsp;I can't backup my files ...<br />

I have an ASUS G75VW-T1392H notebook.<br />

    <title>Unable to switch to a Microsoft Account from a Local Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank castro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to switch to a Microsoft Account from a Local Account</h2>
                    <p>Scenario: I have a machine with a local account - the local account works fine, but I want to get some added&nbsp;features that the Microsoft Account can provide.&nbsp; When I try to make the switch, I get the security verification, get prompted for Skydrive connection,
 then receive the following error:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"We couldn't change your account because there's already an account on this PC with this email address".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Steps Performed:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bing search.&nbsp; Two hits - one unanswered and one where the person providing the answer didn't read the question.</li><li>Checked to see if any applications were associated with my Microsoft Account (store, skydrive, etc.) - I couldn't find any (they are all awaiting login)</li><li>Created a second local account on the machine, promoted it to&nbsp;an&nbsp;Administrator, logged in&nbsp;to the new account and&nbsp;attempted to switch to a Microsoft Account through it.&nbsp; Same error.</li><li>Deleted the original account, rebooted.&nbsp; Logged in&nbsp;with the second account (now the only account on the system).&nbsp; Tried to switch - same error.</li><li>Deleted all the profiles in the \Users directory except \Public, UpdatusUser, and the one belonging to the newly created account.&nbsp; Tried to switch - same error.</li><li>Opened up Regedit and performed a search for the e-mail account I'm trying to switch it to (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).&nbsp; Found x entries:</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IdentityStore\Cache\GlobalStore\IdentityCache\ - sounded like a good candidate, exported and deleted</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\RegisteredOwner - iffy about clearing this one</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Enum\SWD\DAFUPnPProvider - this is for media stuff, can't see this being it</p>
<p>HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\StoredIdentities - I think CRL is legacy support stuff.&nbsp; Exported it and tried to wipe it... no go (denied).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Rebooted after the registry changes.&nbsp; Same results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There must be some cached data from when I installed this some time ago, but I can't find it.&nbsp; I've got another machine I want to do the same thing with and I'm guessing I'll hit the same issue.&nbsp; I'd like to avoid reinstalls if I can help it but more importantly
 I'd like to know where its&nbsp;storing this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p><span>Hi postmanpot,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall your existing sound drivers completely and then install the latest drivers for your sound card by downloading
 it from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Steps to re-install the audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Note: Download the sound drivers from manufacturer and save it on to the desktop before you uninstall the existing sound drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the audio component and click on uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Also
 make sure to uninstall the audio software that came along with your Audio card.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you completely uninstall the audio component from your computer, double click on the downloaded audio driver file and then follow the instructions to complete the installation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer once the driver is completely installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Test the issue with a new user account</span></strong></p>

                    <span>
<p><em>Original Title:&nbsp; <span>Windows 7 No Sound Problem</span> </em></p>
<p>After I updated my computer on sunday September 12, 2010, my audio or sounds does not work anymore. Since then I have been looking everywhere from google, youtube, Microsoft Solution, Windows 7 forums, and even RealTek's download site, I somehow cannot find
 any solution to my problem. My sound icon displays "No Speakers or headphones are plugged in" even though I have my speakers plugged in the Line-In. Everytime I try System Restore, I get an error message number 8007013 and it keeps saying turn off my firewall
 so it can restore properly but my firewall is off and it keeps saying the same thing. Please I need help!</p>
<p>System specs:</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 545s</p>
<p>Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU E7500 @ 2.93GHz</p>
<p>Installed Memory (RAM): 6.00 GB</p>

<p><span>Hi Jay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>For Sound Issue:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your computer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dfh/desktops/desktop-inspiron-545s/pd.aspx?refid=desktop-inspiron-545s&amp;cs=22&amp;s=dfh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Dell
 545s</span></a> is totally compatible with Windows 7 and should work without a hitch if proper drivers are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have a look at some of the suggestions for sound problems in Dell website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?docid=723E16D6D39F3C29E040AE0AB6E11FE9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Troubleshooting
 Sound Issues in Microsoft Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also see:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tips for fixing common sound problems</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the suggestions work, you may want to test with another sound card and see if sound works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>System Restore issue:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there any particular reason why you're trying to perform System Restore?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes disabling a firewall isn't sufficient. Also, some anti-virus programs come bundled with firewall software. These programs can interfere
 with system restore. As such, uninstall all the third party antivirus/firewall before performing system restore.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span> Running the computer
 without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software or install the same after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</span></em></p>

<p>Thanks I went to dell website, downloaded the recommended driver, but now my problem is that the troubleshoot keeps failing to download a device driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message is always:</p>
<p>Device Driver software was not successfully installed</p>
<p>Please Consult with your device manufacturer for assistance getting this device installed.</p>
<p>High Definition Audio Device<span> </span>Failed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: I went to Tips for fixing common sound problems and I went to my device manager, sounds, properties, then I saw the device status on general tab it said "This device cannot start. (Code 10)"</p>
<p>What can I do to fix this?</p>

    <title>Xbox Slim goes NUTS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fembot xbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Slim goes NUTS&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My Slim's fan and disc tray go NUTS everytime I launch the avatar editor. Anyone else get this?!?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's so bizzare, the xbox slim sounds like a jet taking off every time I launch the avatar editor, and I have to quickly return to the dashboard for fear of the slim dying from this rather unnatural occurrence.</p>
<p>Any ideas?! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-18.gif" /></p>

<p>Don't get it fixed for something like that. You'll have to wait atleast 3 weeks and then you might get a re-furbished xbox or something instead. Just stay away from the avatar editor.</p>

    <title>Figuring out why I do not have some KBs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Figuring out why I do not have some KBs</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all of you reading this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm doing a little experiment using <strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong>, the full&nbsp;<strong>BulletinSearch.xlsx</strong> file and a list of all KB's I have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to see if I can get the same result as Baseline (seeing if I have any KB's missing) by comparing which KB's I have to what the BulletinSearch says I should have according to the search parameter "%Office%2013%32%" (using SQL) so basically searching
 for all KB's for the Office 2013 32 bit.</p>
<p>My query found all the same KB's as Baseline plus a few others. Some of which were explained by being "Not applicable" or by referring to something within Office I didn't have installed. But a few of the KB's my query returned that I do not have installed
 and Baseline does not say I am missing I should have. Or at least I find no reason for why they should not be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB2810009<br />
KB2880502</p>
<p>KB2768017</p>
<p>KB2837618</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit</p>
<p>I have Office 2013 Professional Plus 32-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked if these KB's are superseded by any and they are not.</p>
<p>They all apply to Office 2013 in one way or another so I do not see why I should not have them installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in understanding this appreciated!</p>
<p />

    <title>How do you import the pictures from a folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you import the pictures from a folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Window 7 and Windows Photo Gallery 2012 (Build 16.4.3503.728).&nbsp; I had the same problem using Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to import the pictures/videos I have taken with my phone into my computer by importing them using WPG so the they will be sorted into folders by date.&nbsp; When I connect my phone to the computer, the entire sd card is mounted as an external drive.&nbsp;
 The problem is the photos/videos I want to import are in the DCIM folder, but WPG tries to import all pictures/videos including those being stored by phone apps and downloaded movies.&nbsp; WPG gives&nbsp;me the option to not import&nbsp;everything, but the only way to sort
 and select is by date taken, not by&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would really like to be able to do it&nbsp;to select a folder on my computer and have WPG&nbsp;do an&nbsp;import operation on the images in that folder.&nbsp; In the past, I have&nbsp;cleaned a USB flash drive,&nbsp;copied the&nbsp;photos/vidoes onto it, then imported from the USB
 drive, which seems&nbsp;more than a little silly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that I can't just copy the files over using File Explorer because I want them to be sorted into folders by date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We currently don't have the option to import by folder in Photo Gallery 2012.&nbsp; Your workaround to use a USB flash drive is a good option for now,
<span>I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts about the look and features of Windows Photo Gallery, and for your suggestions of new features you think are important to add to the product.</span></span></p>
