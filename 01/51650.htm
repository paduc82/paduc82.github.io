<h2>            Windows Update in Windows 10 stuck at 59&#37; downloaded</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Windows 10.&nbsp; I went into settings to see how Windows Updates were installed and it said it was downloading updates.&nbsp; It said it was at 59% downloaded.&nbsp; I checked again many hours later and still 59%.&nbsp; Same thing the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooting program for Windows Update and it said there were no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get this update completed?&nbsp; Is there a way that I can have it notify me when there are updates so I can run them myself?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically my computer is not on all day.&nbsp; It's a laptop which I close when I'm not using&nbsp; it.&nbsp; If I knew update was running I'd leave it until it was completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating.&nbsp; I want to protect my computer and have always been very careful to do so.&nbsp; Now I feel helpless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last successful update was KB3116869.&nbsp; I don't know what it's trying to download now.</p>

            <p>Do you have 3rd party AV installed?&nbsp; If so remove it completely. </p>
<p>Do you have enough free space on your C:\ drive?&nbsp;&nbsp; 16GB+ is needed, more is lots of programs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why would suddenly NIS be a problem?&nbsp; I sure can't disable my anti-virus software permanently</p>

            <p>The problem seem to be that if you just disable it the code is still in he computer and Windows 10 installation program does not like it.&nbsp; I am only using Windows Defender and MalwareBytes.&nbsp; Biggest problem of security is the clicking on the links in bogus
 emails and going to sites that are not known to be trusted.&nbsp; I reported 2 phishing emails to Suddenlink today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really think you need Norton, reinstall after updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't paid for Security programs for years.&nbsp; There are a number of good free ones out there if you do not think Windows Defender can't do the job.</p>

<h2>            My laptop beeps and then shuts down</h2>
                    I played with the power settings. And then when i restarted windows, my laptop started beeping. And after so much beeping&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;shut down. I tried everything. I did a system restore. But nothing helped. So i reinstalled windows. But still happening.
 I finally understood that windows messed up some bios settings. So i&nbsp;found 4 programs to reset the bios. One didnt work, because my system doesnt support full screen. Second didnt work because NT doesnt allow direct hardware access. Third didnt even reset
 CMOS checksum. And the final program visually reset bios, but it didnt reset it really. Because just before using this final program to make sure i changed the bios setting to enable beep at computer start. And after using this program named CMOS De-Animator
 3, it visually showed in bios settings that beeping at computer start is disabled. But my&nbsp;laptop kept on beeping at start. So it visually changed the settings, but didnt change them in reality. So i need a progra

            <p>A consistent beeping with no boot means you have a bad CMOS (RAM) chip and need to have it replaced. &nbsp;If it starts to boot and runs for several minutes, then the beeping starts and the machine shuts down it's most likely a failed cooling fan. &nbsp;Either way
 this is most likely a hardware issue and the machine will require physical repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mention being able to access BIOS settings that means it's less likely to be the RAM (unless you have two chips with one good and one bad) and the cooling fan solution is most likely. &nbsp;You'll probably need a technician who can open the case and
 replace the case cooling fan. &nbsp;The case cooling fan is the one located closer to your vents. &nbsp;The CPU cooling fan is located immediately adjacent to the main processor. &nbsp;The reason I say the case cooling fan is more likely to be the one that's failed, is that
 if your CPU cooling fan was failing your machine would likely shut down within 30 seconds of boot, and your mention of BIOS settings suggests you're getting a bit more time than that. &nbsp;Make sure that you get an exact replacement on the part number for the
 fan or you'll have additional problems in the future. &nbsp;You cannot swap out parts on a laptop like you can on a desktop.&nbsp;</p>

            I found out what's happening and got my laptop fixed. My usb flash stick was too hot so i thought that cpu fan stopped working. I took my laptop to the store. They told me that my fan was working but the fan place at the motherboard was not working. So
 they fixed my motherboard. And everything is alright now.

<h2>            Default Mail Images</h2>
                    For the default mail background images, there is one that is a large mountain with forest and a lake. Just out of curiosity, is this Mount Elbert in Colorado? It looks familiar but of course I cant find any information.

            Thats a good question. I think the best folks to ask are the developers. If you use Twitter, you can ask them directly at <a href="https://twitter.com/outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://twitter.com/outlook</a>

<br />They are always responsive. It kinda looks like Mt. St. Helen to me though.

    <title>Getting Blue Screen of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adeeshjain01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    I am getting the blue screen of death from 2-3 days.&nbsp; On an online crash analysis site http://www.osronline.com, I uploaded the dump file whose analysis screenshot is attached, since I am new to these things I can't make much of what it says. A process
 name TiWorker.exe is mentioned in the report which is related to windows update service and also I am getting a message "An update is being prepared for your device, but it's not quite ready yet. We'll keep trying or you can try again now." from 2-3 days.
 So, I guessed due to update problem&nbsp; Blue screen is appearing. But when I downloaded the update manually and tried to install it, it says this update is already installed. I don't know what to do. Can somebody suggest how can I get rid of blue screens?&nbsp;Thank
 You.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fe4f7f2-62b8-4337-aafb-637969a8ab79?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fe4f7f2-62b8-4337-aafb-637969a8ab79?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/274b3824-eee6-4265-8c5c-4c1bfe1bf38e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/274b3824-eee6-4265-8c5c-4c1bfe1bf38e?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7d255ea-9111-4900-b639-e2fd8f923196?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7d255ea-9111-4900-b639-e2fd8f923196?upload=true" /></a>

<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

            If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the cause.
<br />
<br />No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an extreme overkill point.

<p>Hello Rob, Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that I&nbsp; have Malwarebytes installed and have run the scan, It removed some PUP files but It didn't help with the BSOD problem. I also ran the memory test as suggested by you but it didn't show any error.</p>
<p>Here is the link to dump files folder I uploaded on Onedrive.</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!Amej2ky6mLtlgzUj6SijBu20x7dy&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also I would like to ask could it be a problem with the latest update by Microsoft as I mentioned in my question post that when searched for an update&nbsp; a message appears&nbsp;<span>"An update is being prepared for your device,
 but it's not quite ready yet. We'll keep trying or you can try again now." While trying to install the update manually says this update is already installed.&nbsp;</span></p>

            MBAM is the industry nickname for Malwarebytes.
<br />
<br />The issue is between Net Protector and the Windows Update and it is really a problem with Net Protector. So if updated I would uninstall it. The odds are very high it will interfere with other updates down the road unless its developers correct the problem. Hundreds of millions of users do not have that problem with updates so it has to be Net Protector.
<br />
<br />You can also try removing the update though I would not unless there were no other options to try.
<br />
<br />If you really want to do this.

<p>Thank you for your much-needed help. I have uninstalled Net protector as you suggested. Hope the problem will be resolved and I will not get any blue screens in future. But, if the problem persists I will get back to you on this thread. Thanks again.</p>

            <p>When the computer was purchased what version of windows was preinstalled?</p>
<p>Can we please check that your computer is free of malware.</p>
<p>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.
</p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions
 and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

            <p>Hello ifd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stop 0x9C blue screen indicates that a hardware error was reported to the processor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be best to contact your computer's manufacturer to run hardware diagnostics on the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also be able to provide the generated dump files to them in order to help determine which component has failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<em>reformat and resintall</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>What COA sticker came with it?</p>
<p>Is there a COA sticker on the machine itself?</p>

<p><span><span>Hello pcj903,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To add to what Placouk says, when you get that message, check in Task Manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) to see if you have "WinMail.exe" (no quotes)listed
 under the Processes tab. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do, click on each one listed to highlight it and click the "End Process" button. This will get close all instances if Windows Mail that may
 be running. It can still be listed eventhough you close Window Mail if it is still trying to finish a process.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try to set your computer to clean boot to check if any service running the background could be causing this issue.

<h2>            Pairing a Microsoft Surface Keyboard with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Just bought one of these but the company I am working for uses Windows 7 rather than Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noting that the keyboard works with Windows 10, is there any way to get it to pair with Windows 7 or do I need to send it back for a refund?</p>

    <title>Customer Support at Microsoft is appalling. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> konnor13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customer Support at Microsoft is appalling.</h2>
                    
<p>So, because of the new terms and conditions update, I can no longer access my gamertag, or infact anything on my xbl profile. When I try to accept the terms and conditions, it just tells me that there is an error with my profile and that I should use the
 error code to find solutions online.</p>
<p>As it stands i've been unable to access my gt for 3 days now, and am starting to expect some form of compensation for the 3 days of xbl that i've not been able to access as i've paid for a year of it. I got on chat to microsoft and after putting me through
 a completely pointless (and irritating) account recovery form, which had many fields that I was not able to fill out, such as emails that had been sent on this account, and previous passwords, the problem was no further along to being solved and the technician
 on chat basically told me there was nothing he could do and that he may have to notify a different team of the problem, not only this but it could take TWO WEEKS TO BE SOLVED.</p>
<p>How the hell am I supposed to fill out fields for emails when I have never sent any on this account?How am I supposed to fill out previous passwords when I have only had ONE. The recovery forms are 100% completely flawed and even though I had the card numbers
 of two cards on the account, and the email addresses, pretty much all the information that was available to me, there was still not enough to recover my account. Eventually microsoft managed to recover the account, but this changed absolutely nothing so was
 completely pointless and an utter waste of 2 hours of my time. They then wasted another 3 hours of my time the following day and my account is still in exactly the same position it was when the problem was first noticed.</p>
<p>At the moment it looks like i'm going to lose my gamertag which has well over 6 years of game saves on it, including around 2 months of d3 progress.</p>

<p>Hey there Konnor,<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry to hear you've been having issues with your account.<br />
<br />
I really wish I had a better answer for you and I know it's not what you want to hear, but if you've already contacted our Phone Support and been passed to an Advocacy team to investigate, then that team will be best equipped moving forward to look into your
 account with you and get things sorted out. <br />
<br />
Once they contact you, I would definitely reach out to them with further questions or concerns. Any questions about compensation would also need to be directed to that team as they now own your case.</p>

<p>Xbox probably has a million people calling them about this very issue right now. &nbsp;That is why there is a wait. &nbsp;The best way to avoid a long wait to fix your account is to not forget your information. &nbsp;I would suggest following that course in the future.</p>

<p>I didn't 'forget' the information, I know every single piece of information associated with the account. The problem is that none of it was created in the first place, I never sent emails or messages with the account on this site as I only use it for xbl.
 I filled out all of the fields I could but the rest of the fields I was unable to fill as the information was never available to me in the first place. so no , I didn't 'forget' the information, and I never implied that I did in the first place.</p>

<p>Sorry, I missed something out in the original answer.</p>
<p>For some reason I am still considered a minor (i'm an adult now), but I can't accept the terms because apparently there is a parental account associated with mine, however there is none, the account that was associated isn't now and so there is no way for
 me to be able to accept the terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>            Connect to live on xbox 360 emulator</h2>
                    
<p>Thanks for your answer again, MilesPrower96. But the thing is I can't connect to my webpage using the IP address in the network settings. It's 192.168.1.112. My problem is when I first launch an xbox 360 game, the ''Getting your Xbox 360 info" message appeard
 and it actually filled the white bar. But since I did a reset factory like TheycallmeBlitz told me to, now every time I start a 360 game, that message appears but nothing fills the gauge and I can't even connect to live to download my profile. Plus, I even
 lost my right to own Dead Space anymore even I downloaded when it was April free game. Now when I try to launch the game, it said "Do you own this game or app?"</p>

            <p>Hey LuBulegend92!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're having trouble connecting to Xbox Live. Sounds like you're experiencing a few different issues. For the missing Dead Space game, is possible you were signed in with a different account when you made the "purchase"?</p>
<p>For the trouble you're having with connecting to Xbox Live, please check out this Backward Compatibility Troubleshooter and run through the steps there. It may be worth <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing your Xbox One profile</a> and adding it back to see if there's any change.</p>

            <p>Hey LuBulegend92!</p>
<p>What's the specific error you're running into after signing, and which region are you physically located in? </p>
<p>In regards to the Dead Space license issue, could the game have been redeemed on a different Xbox Live account that's stored on your Xbox One console? Licenses are not stored locally, so a factory reset shouldn't have affected the content that's stored on your Xbox Live account.</p>

<p>My error is that whenever I start a 360 game, I always have to wait the "Getting your xbox 360 info" message to load, after that, I can't download my profile because it says I cant connect live to xbox live. I live in Asia but I set my console in US.</p>
<p>FYI: after the 1st factory reset, I can still launch Dead Space, just not able to download my profile. But after the 2nd factory reset, after I cleared my xbox 360 storage like TheytoldmeBlitz told me, I had my current Dead Space issue.</p>
<p>Now, I try a lot of different ways but I can't connect live on my xbox 360 emulator.</p>

<p>Cross-region accounts aren't supported I am afraid. In order to get the intended experience you would want your account set to the correct region of your physical locale. Unfortunately Vietnam is not a supported Xbox Live region which may be contributing to your trouble connecting. </p>

<p>Okay, I managed to solve the problem connecting to xbox live on 360 BC games. I did what Monkiedude22 said and it worked. I clear the Reverse Space of the game (Alan Wake this case) and all of my problems were gone. But still, I guess that I can never play
 Dead Space again.</p>

            Hi Barb,I have changed the battery as I wondered if that migt have been the problem but it hasn't fixed the issue. It works finr for a while then plays up. I alsontried re pairing it, but that didn't help either.<br />

            Is it the double click<strong> the top to send to one note</strong> or the <strong>
pen writing </strong>or both that stop working? The AAAA battery powers the pen/writing and does not have to be paired to function. If you unpair the pen and have changed the AAAA battery, and can't write with it, sounds like it may be defective.

            Hi Barb, most times the pen won't write but the top button works fine. Some of the time clicking the top button revives it, mostly not. Occasionally both stop working, but that's been rare.<br />

<p>OK, the next step is to see if you can try another Stylus somewhere and compare performance. If you are near a Microsoft Store (no matter where you purchased your Surface), bring your Surface there and ask them to help you test with one of their display
 pens. If you bought from a different retailer and don't have a nearby Microsoft store, visit them.

            Thanks Barb. No microsoft stores nearby. Will take it into the retailer and see if the stylus can be swapped under warranty.<br />
