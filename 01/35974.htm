<h3> joel kva  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 anniversary update 1607 stalls at 96&#37;</h2>
                    I've tried this several times, all with the same result. It hangs at 96% and installation will not complete. The update itself is downloaded on my PC, and my preference, for now, would be to delete the downloaded update. This is due to all the problems
 I've seen discussed on the web, with the 1607 update. I have, for now, disabled further automatic Windows updates and have set the update not to restart the computer automatically. I gather others are running into similar problems. Thanks for any advice (that
 doesn't get too complicated)

            <p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying. Not sure if anything works yet. The new 1607 version had downloaded previously-- the problem was not with the file download. When attempting to install it things repetitively froze at 96% and would never finish installing (not downloading).
 With respect to the Media Creation Tool, I am attempting that now, but it is very slow. I'll get back if it works. It looks like it could take an hour or more to complete its initial stages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping this works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel</p>

            <p>For I moment I thought the Media Creation Tool would work, but now it's stuck at 82%--for about 45 min. now. I'll wait another 45 min. or so, and then just quit. I've seen reports where other people were able to get this to work by unplugging all devices
 attached to the PC tower and running a clean install, but I'm worried that something else will happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to pull the plug this time I'll live with the existing, older version of Windows 10 from 2015 (assuming it still works).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre, although I appreciate your attempt to help, Microsoft should be ashamed. I am 69 years old and in all my years of using Windows platforms, I've never encountered a mess like this. Good thing I also at least have a Macbook Air laptop. Maybe the MS
 folks can eventually send another update that isn't such a monstrous misstep.</p>

            <p>I gave up and was (fortunately) able to restore Windows 10 to an earlier version (2015), so I can function. Twenty four hours of playing with this is enough. I have a Macbook Air, so was able to manage other things while trying to wade through this mess.
 Given the limited explanations for all the problems, and reading various invectives online, I will wait and hope that Microsoft can figure out another update that normal people can use easily.
<br />
</p>
<p>I am 69 years old and have been through numerous Windows platform upgrades over the years--none this bad. Microsoft should do much better, and it is a wonder that more did not surface during beta testing. I could get a new PC tower with the 2016 version
 already loaded, but if I'm going to go through that expense, it may be that an Apple product would make more sense (forgetting about partitioning the hard drive to handle Windows, in that event).</p>

            I had the same problem anniversery update was stuck at 96% after trying several times I called microsoft the agent tried for at least one hour to install the update. Eventually he gave up telling me that probably my CPUneeds an upgrade or I need a new
 computer. SinceI am not planing to do either he disabled automatic update and I am stuck with the older version for now. So much for the hype about the update. Too many problems. Thanks Microsoft.

            As I follow this saga, it does not appear that Microsoft is much closer to a fix: http://wccftech.com/windows-10-installation-woes-continue/ . It appears that they are not saying much, at least not in terms of broad public comment at this moment.<br />

            <p>My Windows 10 Pro upgrade took nearly two weeks to succeed in early August because I have an SSD boot plus a standard data disk with applications. &nbsp;Once that installation succeeded, it has never been reliable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failures happen about 42% of the&nbsp;time. &nbsp;The most common failure is a desktop where all the shortcuts&nbsp;appear as black squares. &nbsp;Less often is a desktop without any network connections. &nbsp;Getting the network working again only happens as several Safe Mode boots
 where the network shows the network tray icon in a disabled state, but in Safe Mode it displays MS help page and the browser is accessing the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time a reboot into safe mode will fix one or both issues, but the built-in diagnostic boot selection for repairing the Startup Settings never works. &nbsp;Instead, it begins with an attempt to run but quickly reports that it can't fix the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since another post showed us how to block the anniversary update, I've had those updates blocked from being downloaded. &nbsp;Still, I would like to get to WinVer: 1607, but the risk of losing another two weeks to get the OS working again is more than I can afford
 right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to stop the uncertainty Windows 10 Pro displays many mornings&nbsp;at startup. &nbsp;If MS could tell us the problem with the Anniversary updates not working with a disk installation I show above is resolved, I would take the chance later in November when the
 holiday period has less time pressure to have a computer available&nbsp;to perform.<br />

            <p>I had set the updates to notify me to time installation. This AM that did not happen and I had to spend about an hour getting back to my 2015 version. The small business I run online uses a database that functions only in windows. Also my accounting software
 is windows dependent. I can get around all of it, and will shut down the small business (which gets me by the accounting program problem--but my accountant also uses that program) if that is what it takes. Windows 10 is (slowly?) breaking my PC computer--in
 steps. This is not a novel complaint, and I gather there has been some clamor for Microsoft to replace computers, which of course they will not do. The expectation that all users should wade through pages of hypothetical fixes is not a good sign for Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now budgeting for a new computer based on Apple's OSX. I may lose some functionality, and would not trust partitioning it for Windows until it was clearer the product works. Microsoft's silence and apparent inability to stabilize this situation is striking.<br />

    <title>Pictures Disappearing in Windows Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pictures Disappearing in Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    I'm working with Windows Movie Maker/Windows 7, which I've done before. For some reason, images will disappear within the video itself but not in my working panel where I'm moving slides around and giving each frame its settings. I can go back into my
 pictures folder within my Pictures and reinsert the image, but this keeps happening. It's kind of useless. There is no red 'X' or any markings over the frame where the image vanished. It's simply blank and then scrolls to the next frame, showing that image.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

    <title>Screen blinks on and off, then the option to sleep is grayed out and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew.boe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen blinks on and off, then the option to sleep is grayed out and it seems to disconnect from my graphics card. Can anybody help&#63;</h2>
                    I'm not sure what exactly is going on. I wish I had more info to give. This is all I know:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After using the computer for some time, the screen will blink on and off. When back on, the computer will not sleep, and if I try to sleep it by tapping the power button, it shuts down (not a safe shut down). After this blink, the graphics card doesn't
 seem to be recognized. I have a gadget that tells me the activity of my graphics card and it tells me that it isn't doing anything after the blink. That's the only reason I think it has an effect on the graphics card. I have also checked the devices section
 for graphics cards after the blink, and it doesn't show up there. This is about all I know. The only other information that I have is that when I shut down or restart, the problem appears to be gone but will show up again after using it for a while.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an HP Pavilion dv6-7014nr Entertainment Notebook PC running Windows 7 Home Premium. I have had this computer for about a year and a half and this problem just started showing up about a week ago. I haven't made any dramatic changes in the past couple
 months, so I'm confused as to why this is happening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure if it's a device/driver problem, but that's where I tagged it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not the best with computers, but I know my way around. Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: It has also been getting abnormally hot.</div>

            So when I ran the troubleshooter like you said, it said that my CD-ROM Drive has a driver problem and couldn't automatically fix it. Not sure if this is a separate issue from my other problem, but it's probably something I should fix. How would I go about
 doing this?

            It's not actually related to the printer. I've printed many times since then with no problems. Must have been a coincidence the first time. Still encountering the main problem though.

            I've uninstalled my nvidia geforce GT 650M driver and the laptop doesn't seem to be recognizing it for reinstall.
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: When I uninstalled the driver, I removed the package as well. I'm guessing that's why it didn't recognize it. I got the package from the website he gave me. It is now up and running again. Not sure if I should reinstall the CPU integrated graphics
 card driver as well. What do you think? (I'm not even sure if that's possible. Don't know much about the behind the scenes of a computer). I'm pretty sure the driver it installed isn't the latest nvidia driver. Going to try to update to latest driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: Updated to latest driver. So, if this was the problem, it should be fixed. The fact that the computer has been abnormally warm has me worried that it's a hardware issue. What do you think?</div>

            Well, that driver was not the fix, as I encountered the problem again today. It there any should I try another driver, or is it likely something that I will have to contact HP about?

            <p>Hi Melissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, t<span><span><span>he terms</span><span> <em>32-bit</em> and
<em>64-bit</em> refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a <em>CPU</em>), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;64-bit system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently<span>&nbsp;because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating
 system, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To find out if your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, press Windows key + R, type msinfo32 and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this answers your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance. &nbsp;</span><span><br />

<p>I know this is gonna sound stupid but I had accidentally dropped a quarter inside of my xbox 360 in the back near the A / V cable. My xbox got a RROD immediately. I managed to get the quarter out but the sound on my xbox has stopped working. The cable is
 in just fine and everything else works including my headset to chat with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it busted for good?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Alright guys, I got mine fixed, hope it helps some of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start up WITHOUT having it plugged in.&nbsp;The first time I did this, it died right around the login screen.</p>
<p>Second time, still unplugged, it showed the battery at 33% or something. Did some software updates, plugged it back in, it was charging. Unplugged it, replugged it, everything seemed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck guys </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 GPO Templates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend installing Windows 10 in our organisation. I am still running Active Directory on Windows Server 2003. I would like to use GPOs to administer Windows 10. Where can I get a .adm template so that I can install it in Active Directory Group Policy Objects
 for Windows Server 2003?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It obviously needs to be a .adm file, not .admx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Here is some help upgrade your OS from 2003 to 2012 R2. I mean seriously your asking a question that you already know the answer too Server 2003 is out of support. The fix is get your OS upgraded and considering 2016 is around the corner your more than a
 decade behind. Plus how unsecure is your network leaving your DC's on 2003, seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes the ADM is done, finished, out of support. Its been a good long run with 2003, but time to move on that is the fix to your problem.</p>

            <p>You won't like this answer, but in order to take advantage of Windows 10 group policy you need a minimum version of Active Directory 2008 as well as the group policy central store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Server 2003 is no longer supported by Microsoft as of July 14, 2015 (when extended support ended).</p>

            <p><span><span>The Windows 10 Upgrade procedure using Windows Update consists of distinct stages namely:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Start Download.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Preparing for installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Accept Upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Start the Upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Configure Update for windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Computer automatically restarts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Upgrading Windows â€“ the Windows overall completion to date (0% to 100%) with progress % of sub-stages at foot of Window.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Sub-stage Copying files â€“Overall completion 0% to 30%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Computer automatically restarts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. Sub-stage Installing features and drivers. â€“Overall completion 30% to 75%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. Computer automatically restarts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>12. Sub-stage Configuring settings. â€“Overall completion 75% to 100%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>13. Customise options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>14. Welcome screen and series of messages (these are slow to move on to the next message).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>15. Arrive at Desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the upgrade process sticks or is not responding at 99% it is best to wait and do nothing for 5 to 6 hours. If there is still no progress close the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant, restart
 the computer and try upgrading following the advice detailed below. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you using an ethernet cable or wireless to connect your computer to the router? An ethernet cable connection is faster and more reliable for large downloads. An ethernet cable is
 an inexpensive purchase.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Connect to a mains electricity supply if your computer is a laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disable your anti-virus whilst upgrading.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you download the Windows 10 Media creation tool ISO and do an In-place upgrade.</span></span></p>

<p>I have this same problem now. I called MS support and they walked me through the in place upgrade and that did not work either. The support person said that the problem should be fixed in a few weeks through the automated process and to hang tight. It's
 been about one month and it still hasn't fixed itself. I'm tiring of the error message continually popping on my screen. How do I disable the error message?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 loses connection to ACER Aspire Timeline X Win7 Home Premium 64 Bit</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>after beiing connected my Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 stops working after a couple of minutes. The device is found and connected, installed propeery but is not reacting anymore. When I switch off and on the Bluetooth adapter of the Notebook it&nbsp;updates&nbsp;the
 software each time. The Mouse is being found under devices and all settings look ok. It is just not reacting anymore.</p>
<p>Switching on and off the adapter doesn't help, also to switch on the search mode of the Mouse. Batteries are new, all looks good but the connection just does not seem to work properly. Already downloaded the intellipoint 7.1 driver but that didn't help.</p>
<p>The only thing that comes to my mind&nbsp;that was different with the Dell is that the Bluetooth connection was automatically set up and connected with the mouse as soon as I switched it on. With the Acer I have to switch on the Bluetooth adapter first, then
 the mouse&nbsp;updates the software and starts working until it stops after 15 mins or so.</p>
<p>Any idea? Thanks in advance</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Alschn</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To troubleshoot these issues follow the steps given in order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Resynchronize your device with the receiver.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resynchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, follow these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>When you synchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, put the device near the receiver and put any other wireless keyboards and mouse at least 6 feet away.<br />
Press the button on the receiver, and then verify that the light on the receiver starts to blink.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Some newer Microsoft devices are permanently bound to their receiver and cannot be reset. If your device does not have a button, skip to Method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a dialog box appears on the screen in several seconds, follow the instructions that appear on the screen. Otherwise, go to the next step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press and release the Connect Channel button on the bottom of the mouse or the keyboard.</div>
<div>b. Check the green light on the receiver. A steady green light means the synchronization was successful. If the problem persists, try steps 1 through 4 again.</div>
<div>c. For the Wireless Notebook mouse: This issue can occur if the micro-switch on the bottom of the mouse is not released. Use a pin or a pen to try to release the button if it is depressed.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2: Try different ports</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To determine whether the problem is related to the ports on the computer, use only the two cables that are included with the wireless desktop receiver, or the single cable that is included with a mouse.</div>
<div><br />
Also follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Troubleshoot response failures in wireless keyboard or mouse</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3: Configure the Bluetooth Device on the Computer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to do this, make sure that the Bluetooth service is started.</div>
<div><br />
Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in for Services. To do this, follow these steps.</div>
<div><br />
Windows Vista or Windows 7</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp; Click Start, copy and then paste (or type) the following command in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER:<br />
services.msc<br />
b.&nbsp; In the Programs list, click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; Double-click the Bluetooth Support service.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; If the Bluetooth Support service is stopped, click Start.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; On the Startup type list, click Automatic.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; Click the Log On tab.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; Click Local System account.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp; If you prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: How to connect the Bluetooth device to the computer</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press and hold the Connect button on the bottom of the mouse. If your device has a battery indication light, it will blink and alternate between red and green to indicate that the device is discoverable.</div>
<div>b. On the computer, open the Bluetooth software. The Bluetooth software is typically located in Control Panel. For more information about opening the Bluetooth software, see the "How to open the Bluetooth software" section.</div>
<div>c. Click the Devices tab, and then click Add.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.</strong></div>
<div><br />
A Microsoft Bluetooth mouse does not require a passkey to connect to the computer. If you are prompted for a passkey, select No passkey. If you do not get the No Passkey option, try to enter 0000 as a passkey by using your keyboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Sorry to hear your having trouble. The enforcement team issues the suspensions and can answer why a suspension was issued. It only takes one complaint for them to take action. Filing mulpiple complaints against the same player for the same innocdent, will
 only get the filer in trouble. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Each time the Enforcement team takes action against a player, the punishment gets longer.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Your welcome to post in the suspension forum to find out the reason for your two suspensions. &nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a></p>
