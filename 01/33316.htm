<h2>            Carnival Games will not play if not hooked to internet</h2>
                    
<p>I designed a whole carnival booth around this game for a non profit PTA event and CARNIVAL GAMES would not load because it could not connect to XBOX live. It has always worked perfectly at home and the only time it ever goes on LIVE is for updates. This
 was a total bust the whole day. luckily I had Joy Ride which also wanted to go online but I just said no and the game loaded and worked fine.&nbsp;What is up with this game needing to log onto XBOX Live. When you decline to go online it goes back to the original
 screen. &nbsp;All my other kinect and non kinect&nbsp;games may try to log on but you just say no to going on line and the game boots and you are off and running. I spent a week making leaderboards, signs and picking just the right games&nbsp;for all the little kids visiting
 the booth&nbsp;only to have it not work.</p>

<p>You should really do test-runs before an event such as that. I'm not sure what the problem is exactly, as I don't personally own the game for Xbox360, I would assume it would work though. What was the exact message it gave you? It shouldn't kick you out
 of the game for not being able to connect online, in most cases it will just notify you.</p>

<p>Greetings! Very sorry to hear about your situation. Glad you had a copy of Joy Ride on hand! Did you use Kinect ID to sign in to Carnival Games? It should work if you use Kinect ID to sign in rather than a controller.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<p>1. Restart your console</p>
<p>2. Sign into your profile</p>
<p>3. Go to Settings</p>
<p>4. Select Kinect</p>
<p>5. Select Kinect ID Setup</p>
<p>6. Follow the instructions to setup Kinect ID for your profile</p>
<p>7. <strong>Launch the game using Kinect gestures rather than though your controller.</strong> If you still use your controller in the game you may still experience the same issue.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this helps log you in while offline. Again, sorry for the inconvenience this has caused!</p>
        </p>

            This error can usually be fixed by following the steps below. Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of
 place) is the better solution for you.<br />
<br />
1. Log into another user account with administrative privileges. If you neglected to make an extra administrative account do Steps 2-3. Otherwise continue at Step 4. Also see the general information about setting up user accounts in Vista at the end of this
 post.<br />
<br />
2. Boot into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right menu where you can use your arrow key to select Safe Mode [enter]. The built-in Administrator account is disabled by default in Vista.
 However, if no other administrative accounts exist on the system it may be enabled. If it is, you will see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen in Safe Mode. Log into Administrator.<br />
<br />
3. If If you don't see the icon for the Administrator account in Safe Mode, then the built-in Administrator account is still disabled<span> and you'll need to do some more work. If you have a Vista installation DVD (not a recovery DVD)
 you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Vista installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Vista System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe Mode.&nbsp;
 Or you can&nbsp;make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. You will need third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.imgburn.com</a>
 ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data.<br />
<br />
</span>Now remove the rescue CD/DVD you made, reboot the system into Windows, and log into the built-in Administrator account you enabled.<br />
<br />
4. Try a System Restore to when things were working. If you can log into your own user account, you're finished. Otherwise continue at Step 5.<br />
<br />
5. The critical files are under %systemdrive%\users\user-account\ntuser. The ntuser.dat file is actually a registry hive. Run Regedit elevated and select HKEY_USERS and "load hive" from the menu. Now navigate to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList<br />
<br />
There is one line for each profile. If a profile is bad, check:<br />
<br />
a) That the key name doesn't end in ".bak" (remove .bak if there)<br />
b) That the RefCount value is 0 (change it if different)<br />
c) That the State value is 0 (change if different)<br />
<br />
Make any necessary changes, close Regedit and try to log in as that user.<br />
<br />
6. If that doesn't fix your profile, it is corrupted. At that point you should make a new Standard user account and copy your data to it. Do not delete the old account until you have retrieved the data you need!<br />
<br />
Once everything is working, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left alone as
 they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).

    <title>Windows 10 keep update drivers automacially - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 keep update drivers automacially</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G480 notebook and upgraded to Windows 10. It keeps updating my drivers, especially touchpad, and makes it not working all the time with error code 10. Even worse sometimes it will cause BSOD to my notebook. I tried to roll back to a previous
 version, which is worked for few hours but later the driver updated itself automatically after log out, put in sleep mode or shut down. At the end, it failed to worked and sometimes it will show the phrase" the device cannot start, error code 10". I have&nbsp;
 turned off the driver automatically update feature but no use. Please provide an update for this issue. Its a huge mistake for me to upgrade to windows 10 and I start to regret because Windows 10 is causing too much trouble for my drivers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It's a glitched quest that does not supposed to be active ever, but thanks to people modding the game this sprung out and spread like a virus. Nothing harmful comes from it, just you can NEVER complete it. If you host a game and someone joins your game they
 get that quest right away and now they are stuck with it. You got it by joining a random or a friends game whom had it. Personally i don't want the glitch so I only play with friends, avoid random people, host myself if they do have it.</p>

<p>the way Borderlands works in Co-Op is the player that Host will give their unfinished missions to the player that joins.
</p>
<p>This way the host and other players can do the missions together. </p>
<p>If the player that joins the host has already done the mission then the host has to be there to do the missions work.
</p>
<p>So if the host has a mission that can't be done that mission ends up being shared to others who don't have that quest thus that mission is spread like a virus.</p>
<p>To prevent that spread use the same character to always Host a game and never join strangers games, or friends who have that undoable mission.</p>
<p>If you have a character that has it, then never host a game with that character you can safely join others but if you host it will spread. The other thing to do is delete that character, or if you know how there is another way that you will have to find
 on the gearbox forums.</p>
<p>How to find out if you have this ... play Borderlands do a mission when you turn in your mission the default quest aka the next main quest to do will show listed... it is says "Buy Shield" even if you have done the quest Fix'er Upper when Zed tells you to
 fix the machine and get a shield, you could get the shield but you can't turn in the quest. And when you do other quests it will default back to that one to be turned in.</p>
<p>There is a lot of stuff that Gearbox planned for borderlands and not fully removed before it was released, some of those things are still hidden in the game, thanks to the PC version of the game and customizing of it that Gearbox welcomes (see their forum
 called off world creations). Some of these things have found their way in to the console version of the game.</p>
<p>I really feel that these unable to turn in quests have caused an embarrassing problem for Gearbox, and the fact that they have failed to patch this. I wonder if they will or just let Borderlands 1 become abandoned with this problem.</p>

            Hi Mack,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing with your Control Panel and File Manager might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to corrupted system files.<br />
<br />
That being said, we wanted to confirm if the File Manager you're referring to is the app downloadable from the Store or the File Explorer?<br />
<br />
Are you receiving an error message when trying to save a file? If yes, what is the exact error message?<br />
<br />
Can you also provide us a screenshot of these small windows appearing when trying to view your file? Make sure that you cover the personal information that might be visible on your screenshot.<br />
<br />
About the issue you're encountering when trying to access the Control Panel, what exactly is happening when trying to launch it?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Answer to Michelle,</p>
<p>When I try to open File Explorer or Control Panel on my Windows 10 desktop this Happens: A File Explorer blank window opens and several drop in boxes with Smart Web Printing cycle thru, ending with a box inside with Windows Installer preparing to install.
 there is a CANCEL button in this box. the computer locks up and the cursor is a "wait" hourglass, the cursor moves but doesn't work. Then after you click and nothing happens in a few minutes the computer goes into restart and comes back on</p>

I ran my security apps and both of the files you listed, no change. This happened after Windows upgraded Windows 10.<br />

<p>Speaking of upgrade, do you mean your Windows might be a 7 or an 8.1 before, and you upgraded it recently to 10? If yes, can you tell us how did you manage to do this? Did you use the media creation tool for the upgrade?<br />
<br />
You've also mentioned that the several small windows are about installing "Smart Web printing". Do you have a printer connected to your PC? If there is, have you tried un-plugging it, rebooting your PC, then re-plug it? Did the same issue occur?<br />
<br />
If you don't have any printer connected to your PC, can you think of a reason why this "Smart Web printing" keeps on appearing? Is there a possibility that an app is connected to it?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, let's see if doing this from a new administrator account will make a difference. If yes, then your current account might be corrupted.

<p>Thank you for the update. In this case, let us try clearing and resetting Windows Store cache.<strong> WSReset</strong> is a built-in program present in Windows which can be used to clear and reset Windows Store cache. This utility
 will clear Windows Store and app cache files. Since it deletes all cache files of Windows Store, there are chances that it'll fix your Windows Store related problems. You may follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>cmd </strong>in the search box, then select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type: <strong>WSReset.exe</strong></li><li>Allow the process to complete, then restart your computer.</li></ol>

</p><p>l when I shut down last night (april 13th 2016) Windows 10 64 bit had an update so I chose the update and shutdown option and now windows will not boot up. I downloaded recovery tools from a 32 bit install on the same computer and tried to restore to an
 earlier point and that failed tried to recover twice more to different earlier points and those failed as well. Tried to refresh from a new media creation 64 bit on a USB but that failed to work as well. I get the error operating system could not be loaded.

    <title>Preview Pane not functioning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neofundy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview Pane not functioning</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 x64 installed on a Dell Studio 15. The preview pane has never functioned properly in Windows Explorer. Image files appear properly (jpg, gif, etc.), however no other type of file previews at all. No error appears. The screen is simply
 blank. I attempted to get help from Dell since this was an OEM installation, however the techs at Dell did not seem to have a significant working knowledge of the operating system. I am assuming this is a registry issue, I just have no idea how to fix it.
 Thanks for your help.

<p>The preview pane can only show previews for files for which a preview handler has been installed. &nbsp;For example, to preview a PDF file, Adobe Reader must be installed (and must have included the preview handler shell&nbsp;extension&nbsp;as part of its setup install
 process).</p>

            Are these handlers not part of a normal installation? How would I check to make sure these handlers have been installed? I have Office 2010 (also OEM from Dell) installed, but still cannot preview any office files. The same is true for PDF files and Adobe
 Reader.

<p>They should be part of a normal install of those programs. &nbsp;I'm afraid, however, that I'm not sure exactly where to look. &nbsp;While&nbsp;admittedly&nbsp;a shotgun approach, you might try creating a new user account just to test for that scenario.</p>

<p>So I created a new user account, but when I had initially installed Office 2010 (and all other programs, I guess), I installed them for use on all users. So when I created the new account,
 I did not need to install any new programs. Anyway, the preview pane was not functioning in the new account either. Don't know if this helps any, but I found out that the preview handlers are all located in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt;
 Windows -&gt; CurrentVersion -&gt; PreviewHandlers. In this location there are a dozen entries for the different needed previewers: Excel, media, txt, powerpoint, word, etc. They all have values assigned to them (except for the Default entry), and yet they are not
 functioning. Any other thoughts? Does this help? Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Might be a silly question, but you do have&nbsp; <em>Show preview handlers in preview pane &nbsp;</em>selected at Folder Options &gt; View, don't you?

<p>OK. Next suggestion would be to&nbsp;try <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/toub/archive/2006/12/14/preview-handler-association-editor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Stephen Toub's PreviewHandlerEditor</a>. It's a tiny standalone utility that shows you which handlers are associated with which extensions and enables you to&nbsp;associate extensions with handlers. I find it invaluable;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quickly&nbsp;scan a log file or a tmp file
 in the preview pane, just by associating .log and .tmp with the TXT preview handler.<br />
<br />
There is a 32/64 bit version available for download <a href="http://www.windows-now.com/media/p/36488.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I just tried it and it's clean according to MBAM.</p>

            I downloaded and ran the utility. It is showing a dozen or so registered handlers, all of which seem to have the proper associated classes/extensions. I presume this is a GUI of the registry location noted above. Still nothing in the panes themselves,
 though. Any other thoughts?

            <p>You need a compatible PDF preview handler, check your registry key to see who is the registerd PDF preview handler in your system,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need a ready-to-go PDF preview handler, try &lt;Removed Link&gt;</p>

                    I am connected to intenet via ADSL. My network seems to be working fine but sometimes it starts showing no connectivity. During this time if i ping to my router, I get error message "PING: transmit failed. General failure.". Within sometime, it gets up
 and running again. Any suggestion what can be causing this issue?
<div>The Ping to Localhost responds normally.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS: While I face this issue, other computers can continue working without any issue while they are connected to the same router. Seems like a local problem in my machine

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - I cannot delete messages</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new computer with windows 8.1 &nbsp;I installed Windows Essentials and am trying to use Windows Live Mail 2012. I would like to know how I can delete messages. On my last computer (using Windows 7) I was able to delete individual messages by clicking
 "delete"&nbsp;I could also delete multiple messages by using the shift key and the down arrow. Now nothing happens when I hit the delete button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow up note: I actually have two email addresses that I use. My "@msn.com" address won't let me delete email, however, I am able to delete messages from my "@comcast.net" email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>A common reason for this fault is this chain of events:</p>
<ol>
<li>A DeltaSync account&nbsp;@msn.com will not synchronize and&nbsp;displays server error 0x800488EB</li><li>The user learns that setting up the account to use IMAP instead may solve the problem, and does so with default settings.</li><li>The fault that caused the error is corrected at the server. </li><li>The user reverts to using DeltaSync. The user finds that he cannot delete messages on this account in Windows Live Mail.</li></ol>
<p>Is this at all familiar? If so, please log in to your inbox at <a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Sent items, Deleted items </em>or <em>Junk email</em>? If so, move any of the messages in them that you want to keep into the 'proper' folder, i.e.
<em>Sent</em>, <em>Deleted </em>and <em>Junk </em>respectively. Then right-click on each of the two-word folder names&nbsp;and select
<em>Delete</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in Windows Live Mail, do <em>Send/receive</em> for your&nbsp;MSN account. This should refresh the folder list; if it doesn't, wait a few minutes and do it again. Then try using the
<em>Delete </em>and <em>Junk </em>buttons.</p>

<br />
<br />2. Enter the command below into the elevated command prompt, and press Enter. (see screenshot below)
<br />
<br />user "user name" /active=yes
<br />
<br />Substitute user name in the command above with the actual user name (ex: "User2019") of the locked out local account you want to unlock.
<br />
<br />let me know if it helps solve

<h2>            Getting hung at &#34;Getting devices ready 100&#37;&#34; When installing Windows 8.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently built a system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AMD FX8120</div>
<div>ASUS Sabertooth 990FX R2.0</div>
<div>Radeon HD 5750</div>
<div>Crucial Ballstix 2x 4gb 1600 MHz</div>
<div>MSI Disk drive</div>
<div>Seagate 1Tb HDD</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I go to instal windows 8 onto my system it keeps getting hung at "Getting devices ready 100%". I can't comprehend what may be the cause of this. The main issue is that I see the video card is normally the issue and all you have to do is remove it
 however I am unable as my motherboard has no onboard video capabilities I need help so I can finally get this done.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to install Windows 8 on a custom built computer as it hangs at the message "Getting devices ready"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this the first installation of Operating system on the computer? Or is there a previous version of Windows present on the computer?</li><li>Have you checked if the computer meets the minimum requirement for Windows 8?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with the information and we will research and suggest steps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The HDD, vid card, disk drive and psu are from my old build with windows xp when I went to install I made sure I formatted the drive first before I installed.
<div><br />
<div>What I've started to notice is that the system freezes right after the resolution changes which would mean it it is trying to prepare the vid card while it freezes.</div>

            I solved the problem. I swapped the power supply from a 500W with a P4 atx connection to a epsu-12 and it seemed to have solved the problem.

    <title>surface rt volume down button not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            surface rt volume down button not working</h2>
                    Hi, the volume down button on my surface rt has stopped working for some unknown reason. This is actually my second surface rt because the first one had the same issue and I had to get it replaced. Apparently that doesn't help as this replacement is also
 having this issue. It just stopped working after a few months. <br />
<br />
I do realize that a few weeks before it completely stops working, the volume button gets a little buggy, where after being in standby (sleep) mode for a long time, pressing the volume down button for the first few times will not work. I would need to continuously
 press the button repeatedly until it starts working again. When it does start to work, it works perfectly, until i leave it idle for a long time again. This continues on until it totally does not work anymore no matter how many times I press it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is this a software issue or a bug? It probably may not be hardware because when it did work after pressing it the first few times it continues to work for a long time.

            <p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have isolated this behavior to the physical button not working, meaning you can adjust the volume from the desktop or Touch/Type Cover, And volume button does Not initiate another action such as Narrator or Screenshot, try tapping the physical button
 to see if it frees the button.&nbsp; You can do a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-do-i-restore-refresh-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Necessary Drivers to be installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently reset my computer, which is windows 8.1, to it's factory settings. When I started up the computer I noticed it was not detecting my Ethernet cable. I searched online and figured out that when I reset my computer I didnt back up any of the
 drivers, so what I am asking for is the drivers that I need for my computer to detect my ethernet connection. I already downloaded the chipset driver, but when trying to install the Intel MEI driver it gave me an error, I also tried to install Intel(R) Network
 Connections and Advanced Networking Services drivers but it gave me the error, "Cannot install drivers. No Intel(R) Adapters are present in this computer." My computer is a prebuilt desktop so I do not have a make or model to look up for the drivers, all I
 am asking for is any opinions, or the exact drivers that are necessary to 1. make my computer work or 2. just make the computer recognize the ethernet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Scroll down a little bit, select "Support", then underneath it, select "Download"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the driver you are looking for is called "Atheros Killer Lan Driver ver:1.1.52.1451 (Supports Wake-on-WAN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install that one and that should take care of it.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion would be that if you have a non genuine windows / custom installation on your system you should do a clean install.<br />
It is not wise to keep a compromised pre-installed system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot upgrade a pro to a home system. You will need the full installation package for home edition and a full reinstall, clean install is needed then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
