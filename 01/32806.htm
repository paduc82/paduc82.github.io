<p>Skype has gone downhill the last year. They removed useful features and added bloated features instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too used to use Skype with credit, to make calls to landlines and mobiles. I've been a Skype user on iOS for years and the current version is as counter intuitive as they come. SnapChat is too, but at least you do get to learn your way around the app.
 The current Skype app? It's been months and it's still as alien as it was the first day. It's unlearnable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should just put it out of its misery and build it again from the ground up correctly. What they do now is not working.</p>

            Any timeline for getting the Siri integration back? Its crucial for our skype bots to work with voice initiation from various platforms. Seems strange that such and integration would be removed after the hype surrounding its setup last autum 😩

</p><p>I find it astounding Microsoft is adding pink and blue animations that dance around the screen and other non-value adding functionality to the iOS client and at the same time has taken away a function that is important.&nbsp; I rely on making calls via Siri when
 driving.&nbsp; I can no longer do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Seems like MS is trying to push Cortana over Siri but it is not healthy competiton from customer point of view. Why two competitors products can not work on same platform when their userbase is same. Let the customer decide who they want to use. By the
 way Siri integrated with Skype was a win-win for both MS as well as Apple, so i would wait untill this feature come back again otherwise you will lose a good customer. Negative Competion sucks. Sic

            This does not make any sense. Why would you take away such an important feature? My Mother is blind. She relies on Siri to help her make calls. She can now no longer use Skype, which was her main form of communication and her life line to the outside world.
 Very disappointing! I sincerely hope you consider bringing back that feature. In the meantime I'm moving her over to WhatsApp. You've just lost a customer

                    <p>I have searched for answers and can't seem to find the right one. I just installed Movie Maker for Windows 10 but I can't access the menu bar. Ads take up almost half the screen at top and right. I click on ads free and for a moment the ads are gone but
 they come back. I want to trim and split. I have watched tutorials but they all seem to assume I have a menu bar.

            <p>Windows Update will constantly download updates in the background, whether its system updates, driver updates or even Windows Defender definitions. So its nothing out of the ordinary. If you would like manage your updates, review the following:</p>

            <p>The reason why your computer is still updating from Windows update system is due to the fact it's caught in a debug loop to break this loop cycle disconnect from the internet manual restart your computer then reconnect and click the Windows update again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work check to see what was installed before the update or if their a third party tool to scan for junkware, spyware, adware etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still not able to correct it time to get right into the heart of the registry and disable Windows update altogether and do a research on the issue until you find the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you may find the update itself incorrectly reported that everything was installed and infact incorrectly configured the update itself or you have a slight power surge interrupting the cycle rare but it happens especially if power tools, are plugged into
 the same power socket, storm or maintenance on lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not panic too much at this stage but to keep your data usage down disable windows update it wont affect your ability to use the internet and download other software.</p>

<h2>            How can I get through &#34;Access is denied&#34; errors in Command Prompt in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I've upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I'm installing a text-to-speech voice using Command Prompt, but I keep getting Access is denied messages within the Command Prompt. (Not in Error Message form.) I've tried the Run under Administrator feature,
 I've disabled UAC, and I've even used the hidden Built-in Administrator account, but nothing seems to be working. Am I overlooking a step of any kind?

            <p>Hi Nachappa C K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Command Prompt under administrator, and when I was running a .bat file to install Microsoft Anna on Windows 10, it was giving me "Access is denied." quotes in the Command Prompt; even when I used the hidden Built-in Administrator. I've actually
 solved my problem now. I went to the folder my .bat file was trying to copy files to (C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SpeechEngines\Microsoft\TTS20), then I changed the owner from SYSTEM to my user account. After trying restlessly to give CREATOR OWNER
 privileges, I decided to Update and Restart. After the computer did so, I went to the .bat file and ran it under administrator again. It showed way less "Access is denied." quotes, then I checked to see if Microsoft Anna was working, and as it turned out,
 she did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>

<br />
<p><span>Hello Oakvalley9,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check whether it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To find out which startup application is causing the issue, try to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program or any of the third party
 service is interfering with your program. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly
 recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
</span></p>
<p><span>To perform clean boot, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility, if
 you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini
 check box is unavailable.) </span></p>
<p><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click “Disable all”.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking,<span>&nbsp;
</span>Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points. Click
 OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>After doing these steps, follow the second step from the KB article mentioned below:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: After finishing all the steps in the KB article, restart your computer in normal mode. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER, you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Continue. </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. </span>
</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on backup procedures, you may visit the following KB article:<br />

<p><span><span>I hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Sync files have suddenly stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave leather  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Sync files have suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p><span>I have been using windows offline files for many years now, ever since it was first released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have had a windows 7 Professional (service pack 1) laptop for the last 2 years which has been using offline files via sync center since the day I got it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am currently away from home and my Windows Home Server, which hosts most of my files (including my Explorer favourites as this helps me have the same favourites on all my PC’s) but am unable
 to see any offline files!</span></p>

<p><span>This was working online yesterday morning, I shut down my PC and restarted it today to find that I have no offline files.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I go to sync center and click manage offline files the resulting popup says that Offline Files is enabled but not yet active.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Restart this computer to activate offline files.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have done this but get exactly the same results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’ve checked the location that the files are stored on my laptop (D:\Offline\v2.0.6\namespace\DLHOMESERVER01) and they appear to be there, but on clicking on any of the folders, I am told I don’t
 currently have permission to access this folder! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am now struggling to work whilst away but also very concerned about what might happen when I return home and reconnect the laptop to my network</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As far as I can tell there have been no sync errors (none shown when I open the sync center)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On clicking through the security tab on the folders I am told explorer is “Unable to display current owner.” For the folders, but not sure if that’s an issue as I would expect them to be owned
 by the system rather than an individual!?<span>&nbsp; </span>I have therefore not attempted to change this as it may cause further issues!?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please can someone advise how I might resolve this and if there are any likely issues when I reconnect to the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Many Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Dave</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the Windows Server on TechNet forum<br />

            Why the Windows Server forum?&nbsp; this is an issue with Windows 7 and offline files, sure they are stored on a Windows Home Server PC but accessing them when online works fine!

<h3> reginators  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rocksmith &#43; Delay</h2>
                    
<p>O que fazer?</p>

<p>Estou usando o cabo HDMI direto na tv ( philips 40 3000series ) que não possui "game mode" , onde li comentários que este modo reduzia os delays.</p>
<p>Testei o cabo composto direto na tv (com audio e video) , mas o delay diminuiu muito pouco. E continua.</p>
<p>Atrás da minha TV, possui uma tal de saída digital de audio, que é uma entrada tipo rca, não sei ao certo. Ali eu ligo um cabo rca e jogo para o meu som? Aqueles cabos que tem uma entrada&nbsp; em uma ponta e duas na outra ponta?Daria certo?</p>
<p>E tb pensei na possibilidade de tirar a "trava" e a capa do cabo composto pra ligar o cabo hdmi na tv pro video, e o composto no som pro audio , mas na tv eu escolhendo o modo hdmi, o audio do cabo composto sairia no som?</p>

<p>Quem puder ajudar , desde já agradeço.</p>

<p>Olá hélio.</p>
<p>O problema do lag é na parte do audio mesmo.</p>
<p>Quando executei o jogo pela primeira vez ele fez uma atualização , deve ter sido essa.</p>
<p>Mas mesmo assim o lag continua. </p>
<p>Fiquei em dúvida nas possíveis soluções, de no caso usar a saída de audio digital da tv , para um microsystem , ou conectar direto o cabo componente do xbox no microsystem para audio , e deixar o hdmi na tv para o video , mas nesse caso eu teria que cortar
 o cabo componente , pois ele e o hdmi juntos não entram no slim.</p>
<p>Vou pesquisar mais soluções</p>
<p>De qualquer forma , obrigado pela ajuda, </p>

<p>Liguei o cabo hdmi na tv , e o cabo av direto no meu microsystem. Sem delay algum , agora sim o jogo ficou interessante.</p>
<p>Ah , pra ligar os dois cabos juntos , tive q remover a proteção de plástico do cabo composto</p>

<h2>            There was a problem checking for updates - Code 800B0101</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm currently in the process of setting up 32 Surface RT tablets for my school and I've been successful with 31 of them. However, with one device, I'm having an error in WIndows Update that is preventing me from updating my device and therefore preventing
 me from installing Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I choose to do a manual update, the message I get is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"There was a problem checking for updates:</div>
<div>Error(s) found:</div>
<div>Code 800B0101"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried refreshing and resetting Windows and have had the same issues over and over again. I've tried troubleshooting from a number of websites with no luck. This is a last resort for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A bit of history:</div>
<div>The tablet has had nothing changed or installed on it - it is a fresh device. However, it had an activation issue where I was unable to activate the device online. To get around this, I ended up having to activate it manually by phone. All other devices
 were activated automatically via the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any assistance solving this issue would be much appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div>Steve</div>
                </div>

            Solved the issue. It seems that by not having set the correct date, Microsoft did not allow updates to be made. Solution: Set calendar to correct date and time and it should work. :)

<p>Hi Stephani,</p>
<p><span>You may use the Windows Live mail which is compatible with Windows 7 operating system. You may try to import the address book saved on the Parsons address book to Windows
 Live Mail, however we are not sure if the address book saved in the Parsons can be imported to the Windows Live mail as we do not know the format of the address book of the Parsons address book.</span></p>

            Run diskmgmt.msc, right-click the partition you wish to hide then remove its drive letter. This action is reversible and will not delete any data.

            Hi Cid, you can rest assured, the Update assistant will not delete your personal data, it will simply update your system. 
<br />
<br />What may happen in certain circumstances, is that it may uninstall a 3rd party application it deems to be incompatible with the update being installed, but you can re-install that once the update is complete . . .

            Hi,
<br />No everything would be kept if you are using the upgrade assistant-however, it is a good practice to backup data before.

<h2>            Can&#39;t get into my profile</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p><p><br /></p><p>I recently purchased Fifa 18 Legacy Edition on Xbox 360 and began a Career Mode on the game this morning. When I went to log back in this evening on my Xbox account it said I needed to login so it could check security. However, my account was created with an old email address which now doesn't exist. There is no way of me logging in to the account. It also won't let me log in to other Gamer Profiles as it needs to run security checks. I have no interest in playing online&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p><p>George</p>

            <p>You will need to do the&nbsp;account recovery form. So Microsoft and make sure that your are who you say you are. If&nbsp;they approve you they will then send you a link&nbsp;to reset your password. They will send this link to a contact email address that you provide while doing the account recovery.</p><p><br /></p><p> If they can verify its you, and get you the password reset make sure to change the email on the account.

I just got a BSOD with the message DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE. It happened the first time. I've recently updated to Windows 8.1 from 8.<br />

<p>Hello Rajendran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Boot manager</strong> is a small program that helps your operating system to start, or an application that initiates the boot process, while the
<strong>Boot application</strong> is a boot entry that represents a boot environment application, such as
<strong>Windows Boot Manager</strong>, <strong>Windows boot loader</strong>, or <strong>
Windows resume-from-hibernate application</strong>. There's no specific version since it came with Windows, and it's not a type of application that's being updated from time to time. To know more about the
<strong>Windows Boot Manager</strong>, see <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/boot-and-uefi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Boot and UEFI</a></strong>. If you need further assistance regarding this, we suggest
 that you post your query in our <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a></strong> forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Skype - Cannot see my own video or other person&#39;s video</h2>
                    <p>Recently when I have noticed three video related problems in Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1)&nbsp; It isn't showing me my own video - even though it is visible to the person I am calling.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; I cannot see the video of the person I am calling.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; In "Settings" when I switch on "Test Video" - it creates a white space where the video should appear - but stays blank - even though I can see the webcam is active (the webcam light comes on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio is fine throughout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The webcam works fine in other software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

</p><p>Version of Skype is 12.1807.264.0 - recently updated and I think the problem only started fairly recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be happening with all contacts.&nbsp; The fact that the my "Test Video" isn't appearing seems to indicate that it isn't contact related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated most drivers but not my camera drivers - though I've tried two different webcams ... and the video is being transmitted to my contact - they can see it fine - I just cannot see my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no error message - just "blank" ... and appears fine at the other end for my contact,</p>

<li>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do you have application named "reader_sl.exe" installed in your system?<br />

            Hi TrevorWorrall
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Selecting system install location from a Recover Image drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> majestykfive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Selecting system install location from a Recover Image drive</h2>
                    I'm planning on performing a factory reset on my PC after installing a SSD. I would like to know whether I will have to copy the Windows Setup onto an external storage device USB/DVD in order to then be able to install in on that SSD or will I be able
 to select the install location before or after performing the reset. As mentioned in the title I have the windows setup on a Recover Drive and this is how it was when I first purchased the PC. I have performed a factory reset in the past however do not remember
 if there was an option to select the installation location.

            Hi DraskoSFRY, if you intended using the factory image to install Windows 10 onto the new SSD, that won't work . . 
<br />
<br />You can clean install Windows 10 onto that new SSD, you will not need a Product Key, activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything , you will just need an 8GB flash drive !
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues       
        </p>

<p><em>There is an open tray and disc unreadable sticky at the top of this forum OP. There are several steps in there to try.<br />
<br />
However if none of the steps help I would suggest phoning support for your region. Be sure to&nbsp;explain to them this happened immediately after installing the new update.</em></p>
