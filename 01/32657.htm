<h2>            Document library doesn&#39;t respond in Windows 10</h2>
                    I loaded windows 10 now whenever I try to retrieve a saved document or save a document, documents doesn't respond. not sure how to fix this, even took my computer in the shop, they said everything was fine with the hard drive and no viruses or bugs. Then
 I uninstalled office, reinstalled office. I have a lot of documents I work on in my library and it's annoying. I can work in word or excel or other office programs and save them, but when I go to the document library it doesn't respond, I just get a whirling
 circle. &nbsp;Not a happy camper! Is this because of Windows 10 or Microsoft Office 365, ugh

            File explorer does the same thing. The files are there, but it just get the whirling circle and the not responding message like in my documents. I can see the files just not click on them to open. It's very annoying. I need to work and this is a huge hinderance!

I can't remember exactly but I believe I saw a message with the American Nightmare code in my inbox back in February shortly after preordering QB, but haven't seen it since, so I'm not sure if I imagined it or not. Can you please help me retrieve it if it had
 expired? Thanks!</ul>

<pre>Okay, I know what you are thinking, so this guy doesn't know how to taunt gangs?<br /><br />Well I know this much, I press left or right on my d pad, next to any gang member, be it friend or foe, I have tried in missions, in the little side quest fist take over thing, yet not once has any taunt been credited to my stats. <br /><br />Has anyone one else had issues with this, or is my game just ridiculously glitched? Thanks in advance.</pre>

<p>I don't have cheats enabled. Everything else is unlocking apart from this, for example I just finished the grenade challenge. Also its not that like someone joined my game and infected the game with a cheat (like what annoyed me so much about the last one)
 as I unlocked an achievement earlier. </p>

<p>I know I had some issues with this. It isn't always giving the taunt. I found it best to find a gang member walking around freely, and taunt them while I had no stars. Most of the other times it won't give me the taunt. Very slow process.</p>

<p>Do what DarkHalf5 said but try to taunt a group sometimes two or three guy will walk together and if u r close enough to them u will be credited with 2 or 3 taunts for your stats.
</p>
<p>All of the stats are gliched so time they don't pop up showing u u have completed them or they don't count. Carsurfing,Emus,Car torpedo and many other hace been known to not add up correctly everytime.

<p>Taunting always works better for me when I have my weapon drawn, am facing the rival gang member and the crosshairs are centered on them. &nbsp;My game will go through spells, however, where the taunt button just won't work and my character will compliment the
 gang members instead (even though I am pushing the correct button). &nbsp;Luckily, this usually fixes itself after I play a mission.</p>

<p>If you're going for the in-game challenge of taunting 50 gang members, the best way I've found to do it is to go to the (Easy) Mayhem activity in the upper left part of the world on the map (I forget the name of the neighborhood, but it's easy enough to
 find...there's a Friendly Fire right across the street).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Start up the activity, and a bunch of Deckers will show up. &nbsp;Blow up their car(s) so they can't get away quickly, being careful not to actually kill them in the process. &nbsp;The trick now is to duck inside the Friendly Fire to make your wanted level disappear.
 &nbsp;Just step foot inside and then walk right back out. &nbsp;The Deckers will be left wandering around, and you can taunt one. &nbsp;(If you didn't blow up their cars before doing this, they'll just hop in and drive away once you remove your wanted level). &nbsp;Once you taunt
 one, this will cause them to get angry and start firing at you. One thing to keep in mind is that taunting does NOT work if the gang member is doing anything other than walking around casually. If they're "creeping" around, or if they're actively attacking
 you, the taunt won't register.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So...taunt the guy, kill him, and when more show up, repeat the process of ducking back inside Friendly Fire and coming back out. &nbsp;If time runs out on the activity, just exit it and go back to the icon on the map to start it again. &nbsp;It can be a little tedious
 to get 50, but each run should net you 5 or 6 pretty easily, so with a little bit of patience you can get it done.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Obviously if you go for this challenge early on in the game when all the gangs are still walking around everywhere, it'll be easier and you may not need to resort to this tactic...but if you're like me and played through the storyline and then went back
 to mop up achievements, this is the best way that I know of doing it, other than joining someone else's game who still has gangs around.</p>

<p>Actually, the best way is to walk around the 3 count crib. The Luchadores ALWAYS walk around the building and this was when I completed the entire story, 100% city takeover, and all the other challenges. I needed the 50 taunts and this is the best way to
 get it. </p>

<p>I found the same as xF3NDER B3NDERx, if you have completed the game and don't have a co-op friend who still has gang members in their game this seems to be one of the only reliable areas to find gang members walking around casually.</p>
<p>One other area where I occasionally found some gang members walking around was in the 'Downtown' district.</p>

                    <p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; For some crazy reason, my Microsoft "People" Account name has a Suffix that I need to remove.&nbsp; To be clear, when in Windows 8, if you go to the "People" app and look at my own profile, it shows my First Name and Last Name (which
 are both correct), but then it shows a "Suffix" which I need to remove.&nbsp; This information propagates to my Hotmail/Outlook.com, for example, when I need to choose my own email address to send-to.&nbsp; In other words, I see my name plus this stupid meaningless
 suffix which is very confusing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how the heck can I edit/remove this suffix from my Microsoft profile?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. On the next screen, <strong>right click</strong> an empty spot and select the
<strong>Edit</strong> Icon on the bottom toolbar. This will open the <strong>Profile Editor</strong> in your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. At the <strong>top/left</strong> corner of the screen, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. In the <strong>Edit Name</strong> window, make the changes and click the <strong>
Save</strong> Button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this works for you.</p>

Hi Scott</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that this suffix might be coming from a signature that you have set for your email account. However I tried to recreate this in the Windows 8 default Mail App and was unable to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any other ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Clearly there is a disconnect between the EDIT function and the data that already resides in one's profile.&nbsp; As you can see, there are clearly 3 data fields (first, last, suffix) contained in the profile; yet when you are taken to the edit page, it only
 allows you to edit 2 of the 3 fields, leaving the suffix off for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's just hope someone from Microsoft is actually reading this and puts in a fix into windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just poor design and/or an oversight in the design of the edit function in my opinion.&nbsp; either way, it is enormously frustrating.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how the suffix actually got there, it is clearly shown in my profile and is propagated in other functions (for example, when I type an email and bcc or cc myself, I will see my name with this stupid suffix which is just annoying and wrong).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 So, if the field is shown and populated you would think there should be a way to edit it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to get a response from a real Microsoft engineer here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You never mentioned which email provider you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Hotmail, Outlook.com or any of the other Microsoft live providers, try using your browser to access your account online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might find a profile editing&nbsp;option there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mean time, I will escalate this thread to get more attention.</p>
<p><br />
Let us know what you find.</p>

            I use Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, when you go to the "edit profile" function in Outlook.com, it only gives you the option to edit your first name and last name.&nbsp; There is no option for "suffix".&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is clearly an oversight.&nbsp; Either Microsoft
 has to allow for the editing of the suffix field within the edit function.&nbsp; Or, they need to get rid of the suffix field entirely.&nbsp; Either way, I would like an engineer from Microsoft to at least agree there is a problem here and let us know what the fix is
 and when it will be implemented. thanks.

Hi Scott</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Outlook.com website, look at the top/right section of the window and click the 'Gear' icon, next to your profile name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will display a page full of settings that can be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know what you find.</p>

            <p>Ronnie, with all due respect, if you are supposed to be a "MVP - Community Moderator and Community Star", I think you should either offer the exact solution or not bother wasting my time.&nbsp; The problem is quite clear and has been spelled out.&nbsp; There is absolutely
 no place to change or delete this Suffix field.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your suggestion to check the "gear" icon on the outlook.com website is not specific and certainly does not offer the specific solution.&nbsp; Certainly, as an MVP moderator here, you could have drilled one step further to determine and identify if in fact there
 is a solution to my problem or not.&nbsp; Well, I just went to where you suggested and could NOT find anything that would allow me to change/delete the suffix field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, either offer a specific solution here that you KNOW will fix it; otherwise please don't waste my time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a better suggestion:&nbsp; why don't you do some investigation and "let us know what you find".</p>

<h2>            Changing CMD&#47;BAT icons on task bar</h2>
                    <p>I have placed a link to a bat file on the taskbar, using a shortcut with the target set&nbsp; to "cmd /c &lt;path to bat file&gt;" and it works as intended when clicked.&nbsp; Unfortunately&nbsp; the icon only displays the cmd icon (black box with a c:&gt;).&nbsp; When changing the
 icon in (shift +) properties, it&nbsp; lets me choose a custom icon, but&nbsp; when I&nbsp; apply&nbsp; the change it&nbsp; still shows the cmd icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I&nbsp; right click the taskbar icon, the custom icon will be displayed in the popup menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to customize this icon on the taskbar? </p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a solution to this problem using option 1 (<span>Rebuild_Icon_Cache.bat)
</span>from :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/49819-icon-cache-rebuild.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/49819-icon-cache-rebuild.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This essentially stops windows explorer and deletes the icon cache and db. Windows then rebuilds the icons using the correct files. I&nbsp; had tried this manually&nbsp; without&nbsp; success, but the&nbsp;<span>Rebuild_Icon_Cache.bat</span>
 file has worked for me.</p>

            Hi Russell,
<br />
<br />Supremo does not have an installer . . .
<br />
<br />When you get the popup, press Ctrl + Shift + Exc
<br />
<br />Right click the Supremo process and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />
<br />Delete Supremo.exe form that file location

<h2>            New Skype version issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In new updated version of Skype (8.15) we are having some issue while copy &amp; paste the Chat history. In older classic versions (7.40), when we copy the Chat and paste it into Word document it displayed as&nbsp;<strong>[Date-Mon-Year HH:MM:SS] Name: Chat
</strong>format. But in newer version it displayed as completely different &amp; also it looks not good when we see the document and it not showing the Date-Mon-Year format, it shows only receiver name not showing Sender name and pasted chats are highlighted with
 blue and gray color it looks awkward. How to copy the chat history as older version in the New Skype version ? Is there any option to do this ?</p>

<p>Hello Karen_E<span>,</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply. If we export the chat history it takes chats of all contacts from beginning day of chat to last day of chat (with .htm extension not in .txt or word format). But its not required for us because we want only particular contact chat
 history (not for all contacts into single file) and only for some particular days not from beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, unfortunately, that would be the case. The exported chat history includes the conversations of all your contacts and its format is HTML file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, if you have previously installed the classic Skype, you can copy the chat history there and paste it on word. Do not worry, I'll take note of this and rest assured that I'll forward this to our development team as feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            every morning when I turn on computer the microsoft support screen comes up</h2>
                    <p>Every moning, when I turn on the computer, my previous days tabs all open up as usual.&nbsp; Within the last few days however an additional tab continues to open up</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the microsoft suppport tab is opening up but I would like to stop it from opening up every morning.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is it might be the feature update 1903 that is waiting for me to install.&nbsp; Do I have to install the update
 to get rid of the support screen every morning?&nbsp; I am not thrilled about installing feature updates, they always mess up my computer for days and I have to reset a whole bunch of things back to the way I like them afterwards, so I am waiting til the very last
 minute to do the stupid update.</p>

<h2>            Clicking &#47; Grinding Sound -- Related to &#34;Best Performance&#34; Battery Mode&#63; &#40;Edit&#58; Potentially Coil Whine&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I noticed a quite audible clicking / grinding / processing noise coming from my Surface Book i7 16gb 512gb dGPU machine recently. It sounded like a dial-up connection coming from inside my laptop. Its most audible if you take the tablet off and listen near
 the bottom of the screen (but without doing that, it's still easy to hear).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought may be there was something in my fan or some mechanical failure. But my Surface Book is only 5 months old and I treat it with obsessive care...it doesn't leave my desk and I use a wireless keyboard and mouse, so it actually rarely gets
 touched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also recently I noticed that the Surface Book was slower than I thought it should be for the relative power it packs, and then I discovered you could toggle between 'best battery' and 'best performance' by clicking on the battery icon. I moved it to best
 performance because most of my tasks require it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I noticed that this noise seems to only come on when toggled to best performance. Even more so, it almost syncs perfectly with doing tasks like browsing a google map...as I move the map, the loud clicking / grinding sound becomes even louder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't seem normal...it's pretty loud, annoyingly so. It's also new. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft staff clarify if this is likely related to my machine, the power settings, or a recent update? And yes, I've tried everything from numerous shutdowns and resets, to running the Surface diagnostic, to updating everything that can be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player stops at 67&#37; when trying to sync.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: I really need windows media player help!</p>
<p>I'll try to explain with as much detail as possible, Though my uncontrollable rage may get the better of me at any moment.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My dad gave me his old NWZ-A818&nbsp;Walkman, I was over the moon. I couldn't wait to get home and sync it up with windows media player. If i was to know that the program would stab me in the back, i would have thought twice about accepting my fathers ever
 so generous offer. So, any way, I was sat there at my recently built computer transferring my music from iTunes to Windows Media Player (While laughing at the apple corporation, of course), and I finally put all my files to .wma and they were all on my WMP.
 Ready to sync up i guess! So i dragged all my desired music over to the sync bar and hit go, and by this point my joy was exceeding me, I was ever so happy to have a trusty&nbsp;Walkman&nbsp;by my side, when SUDDENLY, the unexpected happens.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One song, Two songs, Thre... Wait! Why has it stopped? It stayed on 67% synced for around 20 minutes before giving up with the whole sync. "How odd..." I thought to myself. Regardless, I tried it again. But WAIT (again), the same thing happened. I only
 Managed to get only one song on before it stopped. So I pondered for a good 7 minutes before deciding to disable my antivirus and other various applications before it slowed down. But the same thing happened. Then, I went into a deep and dark state of&nbsp;depression,
 knowing that I would become very lonely on my paper round.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its been two weeks since that fatal happening&nbsp;occurred. I've tried every day to make it work, but it just wont. I went from a state of depression to a state of uncontrollable rage and anger to the point where my parent had to stop me from ripping up the
 floor boards. After 3 shots of Jack Daniels later, I was calm again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next day I got to a point where I lost all hope. I felt like when&nbsp;Forrest&nbsp;Gump couldn't catch any shrimp. And here I am. Asking for guidance on what to do. I don't know how many more lonely free periods at school or paper rounds I can survive with
 my sweet music.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please. Can anyone help me? This is all I ask.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Windows 7 - 8 - 8.1 Registry Edits to prevent Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwyzagain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - 8 - 8.1 Registry Edits to prevent Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Note: If your computer has (likely) already downloaded the GWX file, you should first uninstall it, then edit the Task Scheduler to remove the GWX task.&nbsp; Also, if your computer has already downloaded the Windows 10 update itself (but you have not yet run
 it), you should first uninstall ("remove") it from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The following information comes from an article originally published at "AskVG.com" and authored by Vishal Gupta, but it is no longer available.&nbsp; I had printed the instructions in PDF format, which is why I still have the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the actual Registry Edits that will prevent GWX from being downloaded and will (forever) prevent Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 from upgrading to any version of Windows; (they _can_ be "undone"):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit #1):</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX]</p>
<p>"DisableGWX"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]</p>
<p>"DisableOSUpgrade"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade]</p>
<p>"AllowOSUpgrade"=dword:00000000</p>
<p>"ReservationsAllowed"=dword:00000000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit #2):</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX]</p>
<p>"DisableGWX"=-<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]</p>
<p>"DisableOSUpgrade"=-<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade]</p>
<p>"AllowOSUpgrade"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>"ReservationsAllowed"=dword:00000002</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detailed Instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>METHOD 1): Hide "Get Windows 10" Icon in Taskbar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the easiest way to get rid of the icon. You can right-click on the date/time in Taskbar system tray and select "Customize notification icons" option. It'll open a new window. Now look for GWX (Get Windows 10) entry in the list and change its value
 to "Hide icon and notifications" using the drop-down box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apply the changes and it'll hide the White Windows flag icon in Taskbar notification area.</p>
<p>PS: If the options (drop-down boxes) to change behaviors are grayed out or disabled, then uncheck "Always show all icons and notifications on the taskbar" checkbox and it'll allow you to customize icons behaviors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>METHOD 2) Kill "Get Windows 10 (GWX)" Process Using Task Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on Taskbar and select Task Manager option. It'll open Task Manager. You can also directly launch Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc keys together.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Now go to Processes or Details tab and select GWX process and then click on "End Process" button. You can also right-click on GWX process and select "End Process" or "End Task" option. Or you can simply select GWX process and press Delete key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll kill GWX process and will also remove its icon from Taskbar notification area. If the icon is still visible, just hover mouse cursor over it and it'll magically disappear.&nbsp; If you follow above mentioned method, it'll remove the app and its icon temporarily.
 After some time or next logon, the app and its icon might come back. The following will disable "Get Windows 10" app and its Taskbar icon permanently:</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEXT) Disable "Get Windows 10" Using Registry Editor:</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Registry Tweak 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type regedit in RUN or Start search box and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.</p>
<p>2. Now go to following key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Create a new key under Windows key and set its name as GWX</p>
<p>So the final key path would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Now select GWX key and in right-side pane create a new DWORD DisableGWX and set its value to 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Registry Tweak 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Again in Registry Editor, go to following key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Create a new key under Windows key and set its name as WindowsUpdate</p>
<p>So the final key path would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now select WindowsUpdate key and in right-side pane create a new DWORD DisableOSUpgrade and set its value to 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Registry Tweak 3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Again in Registry Editor, go to following key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In right-side pane, look for two DWORDs AllowOSUpgrade and ReservationsAllowed and change their values to 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>After applying all these tweaks, close Registry Editor and restart your computer to take effect. It'll permanently disable "Get Windows 10" app and will also remove its icon from Taskbar. In future, if you decide to re-enable the app and its icon, simply
 delete the DWORDs created in above steps.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this solution you posted before. It didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our local support tested account on new workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They installed new S4B, and log in for user account (skype version <span>

            Hi DamianWodziński,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. However, based on description issue most likely lie with the user client side. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please try to check this issue via creating a new Windows user account and performing a clean install the latest version Skype for Business to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            Hi DamianWodziński,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. However, I notice that you have said “<em>Our local support tested account on new workstation. They installed new S4B, and log in for user account (skype version 16.0.2126.2152). Everything worked well, when desktop was shared from skype
 version 16.0.2126.2152</em>,” may I double confirm with you whether the problematic user Skype for Business account working properly on the new workstation or not? If it is working fine then it should not be account side issue.<br />
<br />
Which kind of environment do you have set up? Is it Skype for Business Hybrid/Server deployment or purely Skype for Business Online?<br />
<br />
Moreover, please provide us with the detailed screenshot about the problematic user

<p>Hello there,</p>

    <title>How to Install Windows 7 WITHOUT EFI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donoxley  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Install Windows 7 WITHOUT EFI</h2>
                    <p>Question first, complete (long) story below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to recover a complete image of a Windows 7 operating system I have backed up to my other server. But I am getting the error "<strong>Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer with different firmware. The System Image was created by a computer
 using BIOS and this computer is using EF</strong>I"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image was definitely taken from this machine - the firmware has not changed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to restore the image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background Story ..</p>
<p>
I bought a new HP 255 laptop per-installed with Windows 7 without Operating Systems instal disks (I will NEVER be stupid enough to do that again!).
</p><p>
</p><p>I took a complete image of the systems, as suggested so that I was well backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my machine corrupted its operating systems with a few weeks. The boot recovery CD did not work (would not boot). So in desperation, and because time was short I went out and bought another, legitimate copy of Windows 7 DVD with a license key (So
 now I have 2, legitimate copies of the operating system!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the new copy of Windows 7 - but it was dreadful, because many drivers were missing. Mostly the missing drivers were not available on the HP support site for this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created a new boot recovery disk from the new version of Windows, and tried to restore using that. New boot disk loads ok, I can find the old image on my network (after loading a few network drivers). But I won't instal the image - giving the above
 error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the EFI partition from the disk (using GPARTED to reformat that partition). That killed the Windows 7 on the machine - but still gives the same error message when I try to re-image the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going into the BIOS settings .. HP 255 has a "Legacy Mode" - which I have enabled, but this makes no difference at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the kind of solutions I am looking for might be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is a clever way of disabling EFI on my 255 so that it looks like a legacy BIOS machine, or</p>
<p>2. This EFI this is wired into my new boot recovery disk - and there is a way of creating a boot recovery disk that does not use EFI</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has taken me about 2 weeks so far, and I am at the point of just junking this machine and installing Ubuntu!</p>

            Hi ARSENALTASTIC ... it varies.
<br />Microsoft releases updates in waves so that they don't crash all the machines at once :)
<br />Personally I would also recommend pausing it... I have my 1803 machine paused for 200 days.  So won't get the 1809 update till next year.
<br />To do that go to start - settings -update and security - advanced.
<br />From there you can pause the feature updates up to 365 days.  That's the one that changes your version and recommend to everyone to pause.
<br />And then there are the quality updates which i pause for 30 days so the max.

<p>There's no set schedule for delivering updates. There are more than 700 million Windows 10 devices that need updating, so delivery is staggered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing wrong with checking for updates manually. The point is: Unless an update has a new feature that you
<em>must have now</em>, or fixes a problem that you <em>must fix now</em>, the conventional wisdom has always been to wait at least 2 or 3 months before installing a new version of Windows (now known as a 'feature update.') This is to let early adopters, professional
 testers and corporate IT departments discover the bugs that are virtually guaranteed in a project as huge and complicated as Windows, and to give Microsoft time to fix them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easy to decide whether a feature update has a new feature that you&nbsp;must have now, or fixes a problem that you&nbsp;must fix now, because Microsoft publishes this information in advance, as well as any bugs that have already been discovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No software is 100% bug free. However, the most obvious bugs usually show up within the first few months after release. Thus the conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The October 2018 Update (v.1809) continues to be plagued with bugs - most recently by a bug that can affect Windows Media Player playlists - so no one knows when it will finally be released for good. Personally, I deferred this update for 120 days.</p>

<h2>            Syswow64&#47;svchost.exe going online and writing gb&#39;s of data to  Windows&#47;...&#47; iecontent folder</h2>
                    <p>I have an i5 running win 7 ultimate. &nbsp;The problem I have started several weeks ago and I cannot identify how it started. &nbsp;These are the symptoms I see:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In task mgr there is a svchost.exe(located in Windows/Syswow64 that shows cpu usage spiking up to 100%, memory usage climbing until shutdown occurs and gigabites of data are being written to the&nbsp;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
 Internet Files. The thread count gets up around 300. &nbsp;Also when I end the process it immediately restarts with a new PID. &nbsp; If I take the box offline the cpu usage drops, the service shuts down and restarts when the memory usage gets to around 10mb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Process Explorer I have identified the process tree and the immediate parent is a svchost.exe located in Windows/System32 and its parent is Wininit.exe.</p>
<p>The properties/tcpip tab tells me that it is reading and writing mass times to sites that are adware, google, spyware, content gathering corporations and others, each open and on their own port and running concurrently- a real mess of sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; So, I have run Defender, &nbsp;Spybot, Malwarebytes &nbsp;and they found a list of infections. &nbsp;In fact I kept getting immediately re-infected due to the loading into the content.ie5 folder. &nbsp;After starting spybot this stopped, but the svchost keeps on running and
 loading. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did a kernel trace and this showed me the tcpip read /writes to and from the websites mentioned before. &nbsp;Interesting enough one of the main ones was the Net Access Corporation which a a pretty large communications business. &nbsp;I also ran OTL and Scannow(which
 failed at 8%). &nbsp;I &nbsp;am not knowledgeable enough to fully interpret the logs from these three. &nbsp;I dis see in Scannow that there was a problem with the updates and that sent me on a side trip trying to install failed updates. &nbsp;FixIt did not work and that is the
 place I find myself today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this problem on the web, but the answer usually is clean install, but this is a bad option for me, I hate to give up on a challenge. &nbsp;I know it might be a hidden infection and I want to kill it. &nbsp;I need some advice here on how determine what
 is giving the call on startup to wininit.exe that makes this svchost go and what to do to determine what restarts it. &nbsp;Many thanks in advance...</p>

<h2>            Skype credit rip-off</h2>
                    I haven't used skype much in the past few years. I go in to my account and see "no credit, pay or subscribe" so I pay for credit only to find I already had plenty but its hidden as inactive! I go in a few months later knowing I've got enough credit for
 a year and it still says "no credit, pay or subscribe" Does anyone else think this a really suspicious system? A very underhanded way of scamming $ out of the unwary?!

<p>This is a mail that I just sent customer service… I hope at least that it is customer service because WHO KNOWS.&nbsp; I am completely frustrated with this deal can anybody help AT ALL?</p>
<p>This is the letter I have just sent to customer service</p>
<p>
</p><p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br />
For&nbsp; the last year to one year and a half, I have been trying to find somebody or at Microsoft or at Skype that can tell me how to recuperate my $43.46 that is next to my Skype name.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not received any answers all found the help that I needed anywhere.&nbsp;
 I want my $43.46 refund ASAP or credit my world account with this money.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't care I just don't want to see it for another year and a half on top of my Skype.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I don't have a reply within seven days, I will go to Small Claims Court and ask for damages.
 This has been too frustrating I have spoken to Microsoft nobody knows how to reach Skype or how to find a phone number for Skype. I have been trying for one year and have now you think that's enough?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Win 10 Wifi is very unstable</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using this computer for one year and this problem is still bothering me even after I moved to my new apartment with a new gateway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I can successfully connect to the network and it shows connected for all the time. However, the connection is actually&nbsp;unstable and I will lose the access sometimes. I have already reinstall the network adapter and driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my phone can connect to the wifi with a stable access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any other method I can try? Or I may need to have new&nbsp;hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Keyboard Messing Up At Random Times</h2>
                    <span><span>Hello, my name is Abhay Sanil Lohith and I have a laptop called HP Elitebook Folio 9470m.
                    <span><span>Hello, my name is Abhay Sanil Lohith and I have a laptop called HP Elitebook Folio 9470m.
 When I first used it there were no problems whatsoever and it worked perfectly fine. After a few months of use I realised that whenever I pressed the “i” key it would type things such as qwepruio or * . Before I used to be able to fix the problem by pressing
 the right shift key. However now that doesn't usually work and i searched many websites for why this is happening. None of these seemed to help and I ended up resetting my PC three times and saw no change at all. Later, the ‘k” key started to mess up as well.
 It would type “asd” and then open the Microsoft calculator app. The problem got really annoying and I have no idea what to do. Resetting the PC and removing all the files on it did no help at all. Now I don’t know what to do and I really hope it gets fixed
 somehow. I know that it is a hardware issue because it works fine on the on - screen keyboard. What should I do? I have tried updating the drivers and fixing all language settings. The issue only occurs with the built - in keyboard and I really want this fixed.</span></span>

            You probably need to replace the keyboard. You can watch instruction clips on YouTube about how to do this.

            Have you tried isolating the problem by trying another keyboard? You could connect a USB keyboard to see if that works.

            The other fixes do not work, I recommend you reset the computer:
<br />
<br />Log out to the sign in screen.
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
