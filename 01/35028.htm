<p>Did you try a new battery?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If not, this should resolve the problem of the computer falling behind when the power is off or it is not in use.</p>

            I ordered a new battery the other day and it should be coming this week. Was just wondering if that was the reason. I will post when I put the new battery in.<br />

Thank you for the response.<br />

            <p>Losing time is not entirely a battery problem; it's&nbsp;can be a&nbsp;crystal oscillator problem, too.&nbsp; Depending on the crystal, your computer may lose or gain time over the couse of the day.&nbsp; This may even vary as the temperature in you case varies.</p>
<p>If your RTC&nbsp;(Real Time Clock)&nbsp;battery is dead, your system will not "remember" the time nor will it keep time when the system is off.&nbsp; As suggested, replace the battery if the system can't "remember" the time.&nbsp; BTW, I've seen these batteries in grocery stores
 (Kroger)!</p>
<p>However, if your system is connected to the Internet, you can set your system to get the time via SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol).</p>
<p>This functionality is provided through the "Date and Time" Control Panel.&nbsp; This can be opened in the normal manner or by right-clicking on the time-of-day display in the task bar and selecting "Adjust. Date/Time".&nbsp; Once it has opened, select the "Internet
 Time" tab.&nbsp; In the upper left corner, there is an "Automatically synchronize with an Internet time server" check box.&nbsp; Select it.&nbsp; By default, the timeserver selected is "time.windows.com" and there is an alternative site, time.nist.gov.&nbsp; Time.Windows.Com
 is in Redmond, WA (big brother is watching?) and Time.NIST.Gov is at NCAR (National Center for Atomsphiric Research) in Bolder, CO.&nbsp; It as also *VERY* busy.&nbsp; There is yet another alternative, use the one of the
<a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NTP Pool Project Servers</a>.&nbsp; In the US, the choices are {0,1,2,3}.us.pool.ntp.org.&nbsp; These four sites have a list of ~75 servers per site presented three at a time in round-robin fashion (for load balancing).&nbsp;
 Windows will use the first one that answers.&nbsp; So, type in 0.us.pool.ntp.org (1.us..., 2.us..., or 3.us...) and click "Update".&nbsp; If all is well with your Internet connection, your computer will synchronize with a time server.&nbsp; BTW, the country code doesn't
 have to be US.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try your two-digit&nbsp;county code (CA,UK, MX, ...)&nbsp;or a region (europe, africa, oceania,asia).</p>
<p>The system will set it's clock via the Internet every time it boots and, if you leave your computer on, WindowsXP will, by default, next re-synchronize in 604800 seconds (1 week!).&nbsp; This can be adjust by modifiying "<span>SpecialPollInterval" in the
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient key.&nbsp; I've set mine to re-synchronize three time a day (i,e, 8 hours, 0x7080 or 28800 seconds).&nbsp; Also. there is some code in the operating system which, given a reasonable
 polling interval (not a week!), will "skew" the time so the your computer RTC will keep better time.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Must disconnect then reconnect WiFi to load pages.</h2>
                    <p>Dell Inspiron 15 Laptop; Frontier Communications NETGEAR wireless router connected to phone line. Windows 10 MS Edge.</p>
<p>My signal strength is excellent according to Dell&nbsp;"SupportAssist" but pages won't usually&nbsp;load at all unless I disconnect then reconnect WiFi.&nbsp; It becomes a real&nbsp;frustrating procedure with the disconnecting/reconnecting then often refreshing pages.&nbsp; At various
 times the troubleshooter will say "IP Address not configured properly", "DNS gateway not available", but I think I have the problems connecting to the internet fixed, but this problem remains. Often the tab will show the name of the page as if the page was
 loaded, but there will just be a blank screen, or it will say can't reach this page, or it times out.&nbsp; It always says I am connected but acts as if it isn't, then as I described I go through the procedure and the page usually loads immediately.&nbsp; I don't know
 what further information you might need, but I'll be happy to provide it.</p>

            I have had this problem to some extent for months, but now it has made my new laptop almost unusable. I have run the WiFi connection troubleshooter, Dell Support Assist, downloaded Reimage, Microsoft Help, searched Google, McAfee support and visited many
 forums such as Netgear and Frontier. I have narrowed it to my new laptop, my old Dell Inspiron 14 works fine, and my WiFi is good enough to use Netflix, Amazon, Youtube on my TVs. I do not get error codes only "cannot reach this page" or "connection timed
 out" or "server not found".&nbsp; As an example, here is how a connection usually works: I logon to my home page msn.com, cannot connect to page displays, I refresh page, same message, I disconnect then reconnect, msn.com loads (sometimes must refresh again). Then
 I select a link, cannot connect displays, disconnect reconnect, the page displays. And on and on, this is how a session goes usually. At times it works for awhile when I first start, then gets worse and worse, but usually it is how I

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First get rid of ReImage which is like snake-oil and likely to cause more issues than it fixes. Same advice goes for all Registry Cleaner and System Optimizers. Fully uninstall it.<br />
<br />
McAfee may be involved so uninstall it and then run the McAfee Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus.<br />

<strong>After the above </strong>install or re-install the latest WiFi driver - check both Dell and the actual device maker's sites for the latest (such as Intel, RealTek, Marvel, or whoever made the WiFi device).<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even if other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

<br />
Check with your family or friends as some are likely to be able to help follow those methods.<br />
<br />
And you really can't hurt the system except to lose data which should be backed up anyway. An a Clean Install or Reset would resolve possible OS issues.<br />

Don't be afraid to try.<br />

Well you could try a complete clean install and if that does not help it would have to be hardware (likely the WiFi device or computer at this point).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>And you could try disabling the on-board WiFi and using an add-on USB WiFi device to see if that helps. Those are not expensive. If that does then again it is likely the hardware. If it doesn't it is the system hardware and not the WiFi hardware.<br />
<br />
If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement created by Windows 10.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello Knapie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to provide some input!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the new update separated the new Xbox Avatar Editor App and there is also the Xbox Original Avatar App where you can edit your original avatar and select it to use from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into the Original Avatar App and see if you can set your original avatar to display from there.</p>

<p>Hello Knapie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to provide some input!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the new update separated the new Xbox Avatar Editor App and there is also the Xbox Original Avatar App where you can edit your original avatar and select it to use from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into the Original Avatar App and see if you can set your original avatar to display from there.</p>

<p>That seemed to work. Thanks</p>

<p>Hey Knapie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe you're importing it, it's more or less simply just setting which one you want to display. Is there an option that says to "Use Original Avatar"?</p>

<p>Hello Diego,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I use "xbox original avatars" app I can see my old avatar and can make changes to his appearances and save them.</p>
<p>The option you mentioned "use original avatar" is in the "xbox avatar editor" app but when I choose this option it just keeps trying to load my original avatar. It's like the program just won't recognize it. The circle is just keep spinnning around where
 it is supposed to display my original avatar.</p>
<p>I know it's not a big problem. I'm just disappointed that I can't use the items that I purchased for my avatar in the 360 era :-)</p>

<p>I had this issue too. Here's what I did to fix it: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure that neither avatar app is running in the background. One way to do this is to cold boot/reboot your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Launch the Xbox Original Avatars app, make a change to your old avatar and save it. All I did is change a piece of clothing. I'm not sure if this step is 100% required, but I'm including it here cos it's part of what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Force close the Xbox Original Avatars app. To do this, open the guide, highlight the app, press the menu button, then choose "Quit" from the little menu that pops up. You should notice that next to the avatar's main tile at the top of your home screen
 it now says "Launch" next to the app instead of "Resume", which denotes that it's no longer running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Launch the new Xbox Avatars app and go to the section where you can choose to use your old avatar. It should now load in OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this issue occurs because you're using the new Xbox Avatars app while the Xbox Original Avatars app is still running in the background, and that stops the old avatar from loading into the new app for some reason, so all you see is your new avatar
 standing next to a spinning loading circle that never goes away.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To add to Bigteddy's good tip : <br />
<br />
Also check these :<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer&nbsp; (Vista and Windows 7).<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
TIP - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file.</strong><br />

Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community forum. I understand that you are facing issue with connecting to internet and receiving error message
 “the ftp session was terminated”. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What are the troubleshooting steps have you tried to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any change son the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m glad to provide you with these methods which will help you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run the network troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>Note:
</b>After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 3</b> from the KB article mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> I would also suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and update the network drivers to the latest version available
 for Windows 7 and check if that fixes the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated. To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following question:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which web browser are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if the following conditions exist:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You try to access the FTP site from behind a Web proxy firewall such as the Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server firewall.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Folder view for FTP sites is enabled in the Internet Explorer versions that are listed in the "Applies to" section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you turn on folder view for FTP sites, the Internet Explorer client bypasses the Web Proxy and tries to send FTP connection requests directly to the Internet.
 This operation is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer then follow these methods and check if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> You may try these steps as a work around.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start <b>Internet Explorer</b>.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click
<b>Internet Options</b>. 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under <b>Browsing</b>, Click to select the
<b>Enable FTP folder view</b> (outside of Internet Explorer) check box, and then click
<b>OK</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In Windows Explorer, enter the URL of the FTP site, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Turn off proxy settings and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start <b>Internet Explorer</b>.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click
<b>Internet Options</b>. 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Connections</b> and select
<b>LAN settings</b> </p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Uncheck</b> the box under
<b>Proxy server</b> and click <b>OK</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer the following article for more information:</p>

<p><b>You cannot log on to an FTP site or you are redirected to the root folder of the FTP site in Internet Explorer 7</b></p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />To turn on hotspot using Command Prompt, run this command:
<br />
<br />netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid="HotspotName" key="password"
<br />
<br />Here, you need to replace HotspotName with the any name of your choice. Other devices will be able to observe your created so called WiFi network with this name. Replace password with minimum 8-digit passcode.
<br />
<br />Then run following command:
<br />
<br />netsh wlan start hostednetwork
<br />
<br />After executing this command, you’ll simply receive ‘The hosted network started‘ message. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<h3> ejmw  say:</h3>
<h2>            ReFS.sys error</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently restarted Windows 10 in order that my PC could carry out a update. However, after many hours and several attempts at rebooting, the computer was stuck on a black screen with a spinning spiral at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a third party software to troubleshoot, and it told me that Windows had failed because a "critical driver is missing or contains errors" (ReFS.sys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying a Windows 10 repair disc to restore to a system image from the 5th resulted in an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I turn on my computer, it says "Missing operating system".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do next? (Thanks).</p>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>I tried rebooting it as you suggested, but I do not get the Safe Mode screen. This may have worked as expected before I started getting the "Missing operating system" mesage (immediately after the manufacturer screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using my Windows repair disc, the Troubleshoot-&gt;Advanced options section has: System Restore, Command Prompt, System Image Recovery, Go back to the previous version, and Start-up Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up my PC once a week, but it seems as though only the last System Image is available to me (unless I am missing something). I previously tried restoring this, but it failed. I will try it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Start-up Repair, but I believe it said it was unable to fix my problem.</p>

CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)<br />
This bugcheck is generated when the kernel detects that critical kernel code or<br />
data have been corrupted. There are generally three causes for a corruption:<br />
1) A driver has inadvertently or deliberately modified critical kernel code<br />
or data. See http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/64bitPatching.mspx<br />
2) A developer attempted to set a normal kernel breakpoint using a kernel<br />
debugger that was not attached when the system was booted. Normal breakpoints,<br />
"bp", can only be set if the debugger is attached at boot time. Hardware<br />
breakpoints, "ba", can be set at any time.<br />
3) A hardware corruption occurred, e.g. failing RAM holding kernel code or data.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue because of a hardware problem since inserting an open paper clip in the small hole to eject the DVD tray did not work. To troubleshoot this issue, let's open the DVD drive from within Windows. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start, </strong>and select <strong>Computer</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your DVD drive, and select <strong>eject </strong>from the drop down menu.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15054/windows-7-automatically-get-recommended-drivers-updates-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your device drivers</a> especially the DVD drive driver. <span><span>While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble with a device, you can try fixing it by&nbsp;updating&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or
</span></span>reinstalling the driver.<br />
<br />
To further troubleshoot hardware-related issues, we highly recommend that you reach out to your computer manufacturer for further assistance. For more information on how to contact your computer manufacturer, you may refer to the following article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>After installing my 64-bit Windows 7 RC on my laptop, why does System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallred  say:</h3>
<h2>            After installing my 64-bit Windows 7 RC on my laptop, why does System Properties show 32-bit&#63;</h2>
                    I&nbsp;did a clean install of the 64-bit Windows 7 RC on my HP Pavilion 9260US and it went extremely well, but System Properties reports the version as being 32-bit. Why is this (and yes I did download the 64-bit)? The laptop originally had Windows Vista Ultimate
 64-bit installed on it.<br />
<br />
Does the 64-bit version automatically downgrade to the 32-bit version if it detects incompatible hardware?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Sorry, but the only possibility is that you got the 32bit version when you downloaded it.&nbsp; They are, in essence, completely separate OS's and it is impossible for the 64bit version to install a 32bit OS.&nbsp; If you try to install a 64bit OS on an incompatible
 system, the install will simply fail.<br />
<br />
You can still download a new copy, but it will require another clean install, as it's also not possible to upgrade 32bit to 64bit.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t play Microsoft online games</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
I have a really weird problem, my latency is more than 1000 ms and my packet loss is usually about 50-70 % and I can't play Sea of Thieves, but everything changes at midnight,&nbsp;my Latency comes down to about 200 ms and my packet loss becomes 0% which is very
 nice for playing, my NAT type is open and I use BWmeter to have a better online playing experience (I've tried not using it to check if my latency and packet loss becomes lower or not but didn't work) and by the way my other online games such as world of tanks
 have NO problem playing at any time.</p>

<p>If everything comes down at midnight then that suggests that you have a bit of a bottleneck going on at your end.&nbsp; Try connecting directly to your modem/router if possible.&nbsp; Power cycle the console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds till it
 shuts down.&nbsp; While it's off you can power cycle the modem/router by unplugging for 60 seconds.</p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
It sounds like there's a routing issue on your ISPs side causing certain connections to have a problem at a certain time.&nbsp; Since it's not an issue that occurs all the time, it's likely not going to be as easy of an issue to have them correct.&nbsp; One quick solution
 you could try is, if you have the know how, is to change the DNS servers in your router to public ones (such as Googles) instead of the default ones.&nbsp; That may help with the issue.

<p>I am having the same issues. Nothing is working for me online. I have fallout 4 and xbox I cant even get it to connect to Bethesda servers... So if I want to install mods I can't and this has been going on for a few days now. It is not Bethesda, it is Microsoft's
 xbox live issues, and they are not even reporting to us on these other issues, while others are having the same issues as we are! On xbox.com/status says the social and gaming is having issues, but in their explanation update says it's only chat? I keep having
 issues during this xbox live down issue. The issues include all online gaming, not just social. I would hope they would FIX IT ALREADY. this makes day 4 for me with issues going online with all games! Including fallout 4. Microsoft updated the xbox ones on
 the 8th of march 2019, and that's when I noticed the issues began after their update as always. They shouldn't update us til they know the update works. At least let us go back to previous version if things go we wrong after a update until the problems are
 resolved. But No, they force broken updates on us after we have spent good money on games and their systems. SMH&nbsp; this is getting really old xbox, get your crap together already. Seesh...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Tiara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are playing sea of thieves you are not connecting to Microsoft server. You are connecting directly to the game server. As stated sounds like you are bottlenecked during the day, which means there is many devices or households pulling on your internet.
 You can try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
port forwarding</a>. To do this get with your ISP to assist you. With 200 ms that is still really high. You want latency to be around 30-80 ms for best gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi Tiara,</p>

</p><p>Then you will want to try the port forwarding as I mentioned before. This will help in connecting to the game server for Sea of Thieves.</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of a local downlevel document that is holding up my printing queue in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Have been running Windows 10 for years now without a hitch right up until <strong>
this morning (5/11/17)</strong>.&nbsp; Three MS updates were installed overnight.&nbsp; I logged in
<strong>this morning (5/11/17) </strong>and tried to print a document to a networked printer (same way I have for years)&nbsp;and nothing happened.&nbsp; Checked the queue and a file called "local downlevel document" shows up before the document I printed.&nbsp; I cannot
 delete the document.&nbsp;&nbsp;I logged off, logged on as Administrator, stopped the spooler, emptied the c:\windows\system32\spool=printers folder then restarted the spooler.&nbsp; I then printed a test document with no problem.&nbsp; But when I logged in as a user (with administrative
 powers), and tried to print, the local downlevel document showed up again.&nbsp; I have researched this and see a solution for Windows 7 and Vista and earlier versions of Windows but no solution for Windows 10.&nbsp; Since I first posted this I am now unable to connect
 to the network printers.&nbsp; I am unable to print from any application that I have tried, including MS Office products and Adobe Acrobat Pro. No error messages of any kind are given.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I got this error message when I turned on my computer after being off all night.&nbsp;
<br />
I did not make any changes to my computer. <br />
&nbsp;It only happens when I turn on my computer.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes it goes away.&nbsp; This went on for about 2 or 3 weeks and suddenly went away.&nbsp; I have not had it since I wrote for help.&nbsp; Very curious as to why this happened and what to do if it should happen again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me.<br />
<br />

            Reset does stuck at various levels and it may take even 3 to 4 hours to complete it. Hence, I would recommend that simply wait for sometime. If even after few hours, this doesn't move, let us know.

            As per posts of various people on this forum, it does get stuck at various percentage level. If after many hours, you are still stuck
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />B. If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />If Safe mode doesn't work,  next option could be a clean Install. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<h2>            KB3147458</h2>
                    <p>When is Microsoft going to fix this&nbsp; KB3147458 problem? This "update" is interesting, in a forensic sense, because of the variety of different problems it has caused&nbsp; to hundreds of users. I can uninstall it, go back to a restore point etc. but I should
 not need to do this. Has Microsoft thought about taking responsibility for its actions?</p>

            <p>Numerous problems. In particular half my, legitimate programs such as MS Office were no longer activated. I did not wait to see how many other programs had been vandalised by Microsoft. I went to a restore point, which made life OK again but now can't stop
 MS from wanting to install this useless update. Pro tem I am going into sleep mode rather than shutting down as I have better things to do with my PC than waste time correcting MS rubbish. This is the second time I have had a PC crashed by MS. Never had a
 virus problem because I have software to block them.</p>

            <p>I am having problems with this as well. For me, it just won't install. Rebooting is now a 30 minute ordeal, as it spends time installing, rebooting, failing to complete the update, rebooting, removing the update, then getting me to a login prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculously bad, because I can't even see what's failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer? <strong>2014</strong></p>
<p>1b. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)? <strong>
Self-built, AMD A10-7850k APU with Radeon R7 graphics.</strong></p>
<strong>October 30, 2015, I believe.</strong><br />
2b. Did you upgrade a Win7 SP1 computer&nbsp;or a Win8.1 computer [PICK ONE] to Win10?
<strong>Win8.1</strong><br />
3. Was the upgrade offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you use the Media Creation Tool&nbsp;to upgrade manually?
<strong>Done from DVD.</strong><br />
4. What is the&nbsp;full name&nbsp;of your currently-installed&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;anti-virus application or security suite -&nbsp;i.e.,&nbsp;not&nbsp;Windows Defender!&nbsp;- (if any), and&nbsp;when (approx. date) does your current subscription&nbsp;(if any)&nbsp;expire?
<strong>Currently Comodo. I also tried this upgrade with it entirely disabled.</strong><br />
5. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e.,&nbsp;not&nbsp;Windows Defender!) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?
<strong>None.</strong><br />
6. Has a(nother) Norton application&nbsp;or a McAfee application&nbsp;EVER been installed on the computer&nbsp;since you bought it?
<strong>No, thankfully.</strong><br />
7. Did a Norton free-trial&nbsp;or a McAfee free-trial&nbsp;[pick one] come preinstalled on the computer&nbsp;<span>when</span>&nbsp;you bought it?(Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)
<strong>No.</strong><br />
8a.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;KB3140768&nbsp;listed in&nbsp;Installed Updates&nbsp;(not&nbsp;Update History)? [1] <strong>No.</strong><br />
8b. How about KB3125217,&nbsp;KB3147460, and/or KB3140741? <strong>No, no, yes</strong><br />
9. Is&nbsp;Adobe Flash Player v21.0.0.213&nbsp;installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER OR EDGE&nbsp;ONLY!&nbsp;=&gt;<span><a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>&nbsp;<strong>Yes,
 21,0,0,213 is installed.</strong></span></p>
<p>10. Is Firefox&nbsp;version 45.0.2&nbsp;(or higher) and/or Google Chrome&nbsp;version&nbsp;50&nbsp;(or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?
<strong>I have Chrome&nbsp;&nbsp;48.0.2564.103 and Torch&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)"><strong>45.0.0.11014 installed.</strong></span></p>
<p>11. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., CCleaner's&nbsp;Registry Cleaner&nbsp;component;&nbsp;Registry Mechanic;System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Advanced System Optimizer; Comodo System Cleaner;
 Glary Utilities; Registry Booster;&nbsp;McAfee QuickClean;&nbsp;AVG Quick Clean;&nbsp;AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner;&nbsp;Norton&nbsp;PC Tuneup; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; FixMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Wise Care 365; Wise Cleaner; etc.)?
<strong>I suspect Comodo System Cleaner has run on this system during the software install.</strong><br />

<p>The damned cheek of it. Microsoft messes up someone's system with their update and then expects users they have forced updates upon to spend valuable time filling&nbsp;out pointless forms. If Microsoft is going to grant themselves unlimited access to your hardware,
 and then install updates forcefully that users cannot uninstall, and give them absolutely no informaiton on what that updates are they at least need to test these damned updates properly before releasing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe so many people have just swallowed this. The lack of transparency on what is in the updates is the most troubling thing, followed by not to be able to uninstall them when they don't work (or are not in the best interests of the user). I
 can just about swallow automatic updates as understand the need to keep all platforms current, but Microsoft has a long way to go on transparency and understanding that they need ethically to give users control of their own devices.</p>

            <p>Apologies to you all. My PC was out of action as a result of KB3147458 and it spent a couple of days with my local dealer whilst they sorted out. I hope it is running OK now. Previous to this episode it was running fine and did not have any odd programs
 installed. I suspect that when I upgraded from 7 last autumn and the November update was installed something got left behind.<br />
The only problems I have had with this machine have been the result of MS upgrades.</p>
<p>Regards to all</p>

                    I receive the media driver missing right after setup and have not been able to find a solution after looking thru the community posts;&nbsp; Details are:&nbsp; Hp pavilion A1483w desktop dual core 32 bit system that meets initial requirements for w 10 operation.&nbsp;
 Installed previously is windows vista which has been wiped off the partition to install a clean copy of licensed windows 10.&nbsp; I downloaded and made a usb iso for 32 bit windows 10 &nbsp;pro formatted to ntfs and used older xp pro installation software&nbsp;to format
 the current harddrive partition to ntfs and removed xp software prior to loading anything from that software.&nbsp; I do believe there is another partition installed on hard drive that is used as a factory install for vista that has not been removed and could this

            There is no system installed at this point.&nbsp; Prior to formatting drive I updated all drivers to most current revisions and checked with drivers update software to get most current drivers and then checked for any issues in device mngr and found none but
 this shouldn't matter at this point since it is a formatted drive awaiting new installation. to take the dvd and cd drives out of the equation,&nbsp; I unhooked the media ribbons from the hardware.&nbsp; I know that on previous windows systems that sata drives&nbsp; (this&nbsp;hard
 drive is sata1)&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes required a separate drive software to be uploaded during&nbsp; windows installation but my software for vista didn't require that.

            I've made several dvd disks off the iso&nbsp;and I can boot to the drive but the iso will not start, all I get is a flashing symbol showing it is trying to boot but won't.&nbsp; Either I didn't prepare them correctly off the media tools or the dvd drive has issues,
 although I have checked the operation of the dvd drive and it was able to read and display data before I took the system off and I viewed the iso&nbsp; installation files and they could be read showing setup etc.&nbsp; I also formatted the&nbsp; usb drive to ntfs and run
 a new copy of iso using the&nbsp; media tool again.

            thanks for all the tips and pointers on good software to ensure better results.&nbsp; But after running a new DVDr with iso it was able to boot disc drive and start installation same as usb and with the same results---missing media driver.&nbsp; I used both software
 to verify results and there was no errors in downloading and/or burning image.

<h2>            Microsoft family safety failing to keep the limit for child</h2>
                    <p>I recently set up family safety, an dot looked to be operating properly. &nbsp;Recently however, the time limit wants to lock out my son 3.5 hours early. &nbsp;I set up a no later than time of midnight, but he got a 15 min warning at 8:15. &nbsp;What gives? &nbsp;My only recourse
 to allow him to stay on past 8:30, was to turn off time limits. &nbsp;How do I fix it, if there is a fix?</p>

I apologize. &nbsp;The word dot was a typo. &nbsp;The problem I am having is not with the keyboard. &nbsp;It is with the time. &nbsp;I set a "No later than" time to 12:00 AM. &nbsp;He received a message that he had 15 minutes remaining at 20:15. &nbsp;No matter what I did, I could not get
 the time to act properly. &nbsp;I was able to make changes through the screen time page at account.microsoft.com, so that leads me to believe it is set up correctly. &nbsp;I followed all the setup instruction, and even researched how to make it actually work. &nbsp;Initially,
 I was not told that I had to acknowledge via the child's account. &nbsp;Once I did, it seemed to work, until the time issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to know how to fix this, so that when I establish screen times, they can be adhered to, rather than me having to turn them
 off due to microsoft's system not being properly established or set up. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Concerned Dad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been fixed in the Anniversary Update. &nbsp;You can also work around this by setting the curfew to 11:30 instead of midnight. &nbsp;The curfew is calculated incorrectly if it is set to end at midnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
        </p>
