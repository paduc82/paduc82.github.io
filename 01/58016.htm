<h2>            Gears of War 3 Stats and Awards Reset</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I'm new to these forums and this is my first post here.</p>
<p>So this is my situation. I left my house on friday (This was the last time I played Gears of War 3) and got back today (Sunday) to play some gears. I turn on my xbox, go into the game, and when I press start at the menu to go into the game, it loads and
 regives me all the skins I had, then throws me to the main menu. Here, I notice that I am back down to level 1. My stats and awards are gone, my K/D, is gone, My deaths, kills, matches won, matches lost, etc, all say 0. However, I still have all of my achievements,
 and the medal that I use (Warrior Goddess, lol I know..) is still an Onyx medal. So it does show that I did have data, since that onyx medal still appears, but in the actual medal section, I have no medals, I have no ribbons, all my amulators are gone, etc.
 Pretty much think of it as if you just bought a new copy of gears of war 3, put it into a new xbox and started the game, that's what I have, expect I still have all my acheievments and DLC's.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions? Or maybe a fix to this, or am I doomed and is all my data gone forever?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Called xbox customer support, and the most we got done was deleting my Cache 3 times, deleting my GT and redownloading it, and thats about it, nothing seems to be working so It was suggested that I come here to seek further help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read alot online and see that this has happened to MANY people aswell as myself, so I'm hoping someone here may have a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*If its of any help, my brother has an xbox in the same room as me, and his was affected too. But not as severe as mine, for him, his K/D went down by....&nbsp; .1 so from&nbsp; 2.2 he went down to a 2.1.... yeah.. and I lost everything lol -.-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yeah, any help would be GREATLY appreciated! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey Sin, I'm sorry to hear about your game progress. From reading Epic's forums, I've gathered the following: Epic will reset players that have been shown to use boosting or have otherwise modified their score. However, if you haven't boosted or modified
 the game in every way, you can lose your rank if the game is shut down improperly, I'm afraid. If you're in this latter group, then I'm afraid the score cannot be recovered. Going forward, be sure to exit out of the game before shutting the console down.

<p>This is a Gears stat reset issue that many people are plagued with.</p>
<p>There are too many facets to list that cause it and Neither EPIC nor Microsoft are doing anything about it. For a view of what others including myself have gone through go to the Gears 2 and 3 forums. &nbsp;This is a larger issue that isn't and hasn't been addressed
 very well. unfortunately there are many unsympathetic people posting and many jump to tell you the "Well you must have been cheating" card or the "To Bad So Sad" routine or the "Man Up" crap. The fact that this existed in Gears 2 and now rears its ugly head
 again in Gears 3 is sadly a bad joke. Check out these posts and please inform anyone you know to check in to it if they still play gears 2 or 3. I don't care if you read or even respect what I have written only that with a read you will know more

<p>It would be easier to take a hammer and beat the living crap outta the Xbox and cancel ones account than to follow that info.</p>
<p>They tell people to back up, To the ominous cloud after the fact, but again sadly no one real Representative from either XBOX Live - Support nor from EPIC nor from Microsoft Games Studios will tell you clearly why its happening and what you need to do or
 what they are doing about it in any simplified form. I got this "Entertainment" unit for Entertainment not so I'd have to read 9000 pages of crap that would confuse a rocket surgeon.</p>
<p>Sorry that this happened to yet again some one else. Best thing you can do is consider where better to spend you money in the future. Which leave us all stuck if we happen to like this series. I know I won't be preordering anything from EPIC. I bought 1
 and 2 early, but had no intention of buying or using 3. After I lost all my stats in 2. I was bought a copy well after release because I wanted to play online with my group of friends and the price had dropped.</p>
<p>Also to note EPIC has transferred all support to XBOX LIVE for the title Gears of War 3 I'm told, but Xbox live &nbsp;has no ability to effect or modify anything EPIC has designed. Only Epic Could do this and I'm told By Xbox Live support that
</p>
<p>They have been waiting for EPIC to resolve it with a patch which means at this point I don't see it ever happening.</p>
<p>Why? Because no one from any of these companies is offering any statements related to this problem with the exception of there is no solution.</p>
<p>Which is no solution at all when every other game platform or game would probably think it good to promote information exchange, resolve quickly and apologize for.</p>
<p>But Nooooooooooo.</p>

<p>This happened to me on Gears of War 2, did you happen to play offline recently without installing an update prior? I did this on GoW2 and it took me back to a level 1... :(</p>

<p>It's a glitch that usually happens if the hosts of a game leaves and your screen is black and is frozen. Your data will sometime become corrupted because of this. You might have even turned your Xbox off during an online game for your stats to reset. There's
 no way of getting your stats back. Next time make a back up either on your computer or on cloud storage. Then the next time you get reset you can just delete the old corrupted data and replace it with the backup that's not corrupted and your stats will return
 to the way it was on the backup.</p>

<p>But what am i meant to do in the meantime as my laptop is now useless?</p>
<p>Is there a way of making an older .iso version of Windows 10 and stop it updating to the problemed version?</p>
<p>Or, someone doesn't happen to have a recovery disc for my laptop (15-ab141na) that they would kindly make an .iso file from and let me burn it to disc do they?</p>

<h3> emfuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            PS3 not visible to Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    
<p>My network has a Linksys WRT54G v1.1 (old, I know) as the primary router, connected to the cable modem.&nbsp; There is a wireless bridge using a Buffalo WHR-HP-GN that the PS3, my TV and my Wii all are have wired connections to.&nbsp; All of those devices successfully
 connect to to the internet via that bridge and they are visible in the DHCP client listing of the WRT54G.</p>
<p>uPnP is enabled on the WRT54G and on the PS3.</p>
<p>On my PC:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit</p>
<p>- Network Discovery is ON<br />
- File and Printer Sharing is ON</p>
<p>-Firewall totally disabled</p>
<p>Having read numerous pieces of information about how this process works, I understand what I<strong>should</strong> be seeing in WMP 12.&nbsp; When I open my 'All Networks' device listing, there should be an 'Unknown Device' with the MAC address of the PS3.&nbsp;
 The only unknown device that shows up is the Wii.</p>
<p>I'm curious why the PC and PS3 don't see each other and am hoping that someone here can help me out.</p>

    <title>Win 10 - Display turns off after a few minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dclark15773  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 - Display turns off after a few minutes</h2>
                    <p>My display turns off after about 2-3 minutes. &nbsp;The screen goes black and then I get a notice that the monitor is going to sleep. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following settings:</p>
<p>Turn off display - 1 hour</p>
<p>Put the computer to sleep - 2 hours</p>
<p>Hybernate - 10 hours</p>
<p>Screen saver - 600 minutes, Mystify</p>
<p>Require password on wakeup - No</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is: &nbsp;Windows 10 Home, 64 bit, ver 1511</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i5 650 at 3.2GHz, 8GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many different settings and nothing seems to make a difference. &nbsp;I upgraded to Win 10 recently and a few days ago the November update was installed. &nbsp;This problem seems to have started when the update went in. &nbsp;The Nov update was not supposed
 to be installed no earlier than 30 days after upgrade to Win 10 so that I could revert to Win 7 but it installed anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody know how to get rid of this problem? &nbsp;It is very aggravating. &nbsp;I had to remove the password since I was spending so much time entering passwords to restart the display.</p>
<p />

<p>You need the product key from the sticker on the computer/laptop, not the OEM Product ID.&nbsp; That's an entirely different number and won't work.&nbsp; Check for the Windows sticker on the computer and you'll find a product key that looks like AAAAA-B1234-CDEFG-H5678-KLMNO
 - put that in instead.</p>

<h2>            Dell laptop, very slow to load. In CTRL&#43;ALT&#43;DEL get &#34;the logon process was unable to display security.</h2>
                    Dell laptop, very slow to load. Then I get a black screen with cursor. When I hit CTRL+ALT+DEL I get "the logon process was unable to display security." The computer is then extremely slow to load anything. In the action center there is an issue stating,
 "address a problem with intel graphics driver." The background screen is displaying as is the desktop, the cursor is moving freely but if I click on anything it either doesnt load or takes forever. Do I have a virus and how can I get rid of it. My knowledge
 is a bit basic so a step by step approach would be good for me.

<h2>            Copying Folders with Custom Icons Not working on Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>for a while now. as I've updated to Windows 10 Anniversary Update everything was going well except for copying folders with custom icons and there settings with the ".ini" and so on. But I really like to have custom folder icons because it organizes my files
 a lot easier rather than without the icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried copying and pasting, and dragging and dropping. from another directory to another directory with Windows explorer and some third-party software. but they do NOT appear to have the Custom Icons copied to the locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but other operating systems like Windows 10 before the anniversary version, and most operating systems Windows 8.1 and below have worked okay. just not the anniversary version.</p>

</p><p>If MBAM was installed twenty-something days before Avast's program folder was created and if MBAM detected &amp; quarantined stuff the same day you manually&nbsp;upgraded to Win10, how have you determined that the computer is no longer infected? {Rhetorical question,
 really - no answer expected.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <em>know </em>you upgraded to Win10 manually. I asked if the upgrade was already being offered via Windows Update when you chose instead to upgrade manually last October (i.e., the same day you installed MBAM)?</p>
<p>

=======================================<br />
I guess you are referring to a WebCam? Chances are<br />
that it's a low resolution camera and there is not much<br />
you could do to improve it.<br />
<br />
Grainy can also be caused in low light environments.<br />
<br />
Also, I would suspect the camera has a plastic lens <br />
and they are not as sharp as a good quality glass lens.<br />
<br />
The following discussion appears to be the same camera<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the advice.</p>
<p>I did go to the shop to ask them for the product key, which they happily showed to me in my windows 8 basic information on my computer.</p>
<p>I then tried to put the product key to activate my windows when I returned home but it does not allow me to type certain words. When I try to put in the product key &nbsp;a message pops up as "some of these characters can't appear in the product key". &nbsp;I do not
 know if it the correct product key.</p>
<p>What should I do? Help.</p>
<p>Many thanks!!!</p>

<h2>            Security Problems With Zip Files</h2>
                    Let me start off by saying that I've already turned off UAC on my Vista machine because I have issues with trying to do simple things like rename or delete a directory that I created.&nbsp; Now, I have an issue with Zip files.&nbsp; It seems that when I try to open
 a zip file that is sent to me via email I now get an error message stating:<br />
<br />
<span>Windows found that this file is potentially harmful.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
How indeed?&nbsp; There is no option to allow me to move forward with this.&nbsp; I'm really trying to like Vista, but these continual roadblocks to my productivity are killing me.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can get by this one?&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            Hi Rick,<br />
<br />
Your image didn't&nbsp;come through.&nbsp; What program are you using for email? Does this happen with all .zip files or just this one?<br />
<br />
Try to right click on the file and save it.&nbsp; Scan it with your antivirus just to make sure.&nbsp; Right click on the file that you saved and choose properties.&nbsp; Look towards the bottom and see if there is a security entry telling you that the file is blocked.&nbsp; If
 you are sure it is virus free, click the unblock button.<br />
<br />
Let me know if that helps.<br />

<p>Your mp3 player is part of the Sansa m200 series. If you go to the Sansa website, click on Other Players/Legacy you will still not find the exact reference. There are firmware updates for the m200 series and an owners manual.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the manual about needing specific software drivers.In fact if you Google sansa m230 drivers, you will find the only OS that needs drivers is W98/ME. For XP its plug and play.</p>
<p>I repeat, plug the device in. Go into Windows Explorer and you should find it recognised as some form of HD. Do not bother with the CD.</p>
<p>BTW (by the way) which version of XP are you using ? Are you on sp3 ? (Right click on My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; look at your XP version).</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<div><br />
I was trying to install a audio DSP software.&nbsp;
<div>The software package comprises, 1. The Software setup 2. vcredist_x86 and 3. WindowsInstaller-KB893803-v2-x86. The setup will install the other two. But the third one gets failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>services.msc is automatic</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if it is not compatible, is the only way to get it installed on windows 8 by waiting for an updated software version?</div>

<h2>            File Explorer closing itself in Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. My File Explorer now closes as I click on any folder icon, file icon can be clicked without any trouble. But, I am unable to see any files other than those 'Recent Files'. If, anyone have a solution or
 I must revert back to Windows 7 to keep things normal.&nbsp;

<h2>            Res evil DLC error message.</h2>
                    
<p>I have already&nbsp; made one post about this problem but here it goes again. I can't run mercs reunion at all as soon as I click new game it says that it can't read the disc which is strange since i'm playing the thing off the hard drive and I have tried many
 copys of the game and still the same thing. I have deleted it and redownloaded the dlc and still no joy.. I have also got a thin distortion line going across the screen which is very anoying and the sound goes out of sync during FMV scenes. It isn't my X box
 because this particular X box is less than a month old and is rarely played. Someone did suggest deleting the cashe memory and instaling it again but I don't know how to do that but I doubt it would work. Please please please someone try and let me know what
 is going on or what I can do about it cos frankly its giving me a headache. all other dlc's work fine on res evil why not this one??????????</p>

</p><p>I've reserved my upgrade to windows 10 and now when i go to download it through windows update, it just says "failed". I've tried 3 times now and i'm wondering if its an error with my PC?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Go to local disk -&gt; Windows -&gt; SoftwareDistribution -&gt; Download</p>
<p>2. Delete EVERYTHING in the Download folder.</p>
<p>3. Open your command prompt and run it as a administrator.</p>
<p>4. Run the command: " wuauclt.exe/updatenow " ( Without quotes )&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Bamm, should see a notification come up in the task tray saying "Downloading Updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure you don't need to install any other updates before running the command :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Networking two computers with the same name.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a home network with both Windows 7 and XP computers (5 of them).&nbsp; One just failed and I bought a new one.&nbsp; My old brain was not working when I set up the new computer and I gave it the same name as one of the other computers on the network.&nbsp; The new
 computer installed itself on my wireless/ethernet network just fine without asking for the access code which was odd since the network is encrypted.&nbsp; Maybe this is because it had the same name as another computer but I thought they&nbsp;went by addresses not names
 on networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;do want to make it part of the home network but when I realized what I had done and went in and changed the name of the new computer, it seemed to mess up the wireless/ethernet system for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I could just get the computer off the network
 and then sign it back on again, but my wireless network is hidden unless you have the code and I can't find the screen on the Windows 7 machine that lets you look for a new network and add the code.&nbsp; I have added other computers this way, but the screen seems
 to have disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathy in Cincinnati</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is variety of names that involved with Home network.</p>
<p>Some of them are cosmetics, and some very important.</p>
<p>The name of the worlgroup that have to be the same for all computers and the unique name of each computer are a MUST.</p>
<p>It configures here, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/group_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/group_name.jpg</a></p>
<p>The Wireless works with the name of the Wireless Network, which is called SSID and it, configured in the Router’s Wireless menus.</p>
<p>On home network using variety of computer the SSID must be On and broadcasting. Hiding the SSID is Not a security feature and it destabilizing the wireless network (which is probably what you experience now).</p>
<p>So switch on security and use regular wireless security.</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>From the weakest to the strongest, Wireless security capacity is.</p>
<p>No Security</p>
<p>Switching Off SSID (same has No Security. SSID can be easily sniffed even if it is Off)</p>
<p>MAC Filtering______(Band Aid if nothing else is available, MAC number can be easily Spoofed).</p>
<p>WEP64____(Easy, to "Break" by knowledgeable people).</p>
<p>WEP128___(A little Harder, but "Hackable" too).</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>The three above are Not considered safe.</p>
<p>Safe Starts here at WPA.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>WPA-PSK__(Very Hard to Break).</p>
<p>WPA-AES__(Not functionally Breakable)</p>
<p>WPA2____ (Not functionally Breakable).</p>
<p>Note 1: WPA-AES the the current entry level rendition of WPA2.</p>
<p>Note 2: If you use WinXP bellow SP3 and did not updated it, you would have to download the WPA2 patch from Microsoft.<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/893357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/893357</a></p>
<p>The documentation of your Wireless devices (Wireless Router, and Wireless Computer's Card) should state the type of security that is available with your Wireless hardware.</p>
<p>All devices MUST be set to the same security level using the same pass phrase.</p>
<p>Therefore the security must be set according what ever is the best possible of one of the Wireless devices.</p>
<p>I.e. even if most of your system might be capable to be configured to the max. with WPA2, but one device is only capable to be configured to max . of WEP, to whole system must be configured to WEP.</p>
<p>If you need more good security and one device (like a Wireless card that can do WEP only) is holding better security for the whole Network, replace the device with a better one.</p>
