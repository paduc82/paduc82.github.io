                    I keep getting a message "Windows did not pass genuine validation.... Go online and resolve now and get genuine Windows."&nbsp; I have a copy of Windows XP which I bought in the store.&nbsp; My computer came with Vista; when the hard drive crashed, I had the shop
 install the copy of XP which I'd bought earlier, instead of reinstalling Vista.&nbsp; Why would I not have "genuine Windows" already?

<h2>            Microphone not recording as sound is not audible in Windows 7</h2>
                    i've plugged in a mic on my brand new vaio with windows 7. i tried recording something using said mic and the sound was practically inaudible. tried changing all mic settings to maximum volume but all i get is a high pitched screech and still no sound
 recording. i think the sound card is fine as it plays back at excellent volume. i've also tried using the mic on my old vaio, and it work fine. what's the problem here?

<h2>            After Windows Update &#40;14th March 2018&#41;, my Windows Livemail disappeared with folder, list of contacts etc</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">I have been using Windows Livemail for some years. I am aware that MS no longer supports it but
<strong>lets people use it if they wish.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1">Then last Wednesday 14 March 2018, I noticed that after the Windows Update, the contents of my Livemail folders (Livemail, Messenger, Writer) had disappeared. The folder names were left intact (in the Windows System folder) but empty.
 So why did the wretched Update do this? Don't they know that Livemail can still be used if you have got it?<br />
So many of my folders, list of contacts etc are gone.</p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">My questions:<br />
1) Is it possible to reverse the Update and recover my files &amp; folders?&nbsp;<br />
2) </span><span>Can Update be instructed to leave Livemail alone?</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">I hope somebody can offer encouraging news.</span></p>

Are you looking in File Explorer, or within Windows Live Mail? <br />
Please give their full names and paths, e.g. C:\Users\Edsa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Writer</li><li>There shouldn't be any folders like that in the Windows System folder (the one called C:\Windows).

<p>Thanks for getting back to my query.</p>
<p>There was a Windows Update on Tues 13th March (actually Wed, 14th March about 1.00 am) and it stopped after a few minutes &amp; shut down my computer (from my earlier request to shut down). On starting the computer on Wed about 10 am, info on the screen suggested
 the Update continued for a while and soon ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what was achieved but later that morning I discovered I couldn't open the LiveMail icon in the Taskbar.
<br />
But hovering the mouse over the icon, I could see some useful info in the tiny window that opened:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>All inbox&nbsp; Windows LiveMail &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>[on top]</p>
<p>Then in three rows below:</p>
<p>(icon) <strong>Mail</strong></p>
<p>(icon) <strong>Calendar</strong></p>
<p>(icon) <strong>Contacts</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>350 messages working online [at bottom]</p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>But as I said, I couldn't get a large standard page to open by clicking. Now &amp; then, there is a ring and attached yellow mini-envelop attached to the LiveMail icon in the Taskbar. This suggests to me that the BT server has been communicating with Livemail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, when I clicked the Win icon (bottom-left corner of screen), a list of files/folders showed up including the following (just above the Windows System folder):</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live<br />
&nbsp; - Windows Live Writer</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Windows Live Mail</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Windows Live Messenger</strong></p>
<p><strong>----------------------------</strong></p>
<p>The Live Writer seems to be working (when clicked)<br />
Clicking Live Messenger led to the following message&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a65e96af-a9cf-4fac-a1f8-6781aad0c167?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a65e96af-a9cf-4fac-a1f8-6781aad0c167?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>So, Nigel, you are right: the Messenger shows up but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And clicking the LiveMail name does nothing - merely points to the Taskbar icon, which as I mentioned above is virtually empty except for the three headings (+ one subheading) given above.</p>

<p>OK, thank you. It sounds as if the program window has been made impossibly small. Please try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Point at the program icon on the taskbar until you see the small window, then click on the small window.</li><li>Press Alt-Spacebar on your keyboard, then letter S.</li><li>Press and hold the right-pointing arrow  on your keyboard. If the window widens, release the key when it's wide enough.</li><li>Use the mouse to get hold of the top border of the window and drag it upwards.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As regards the entries in your start menu (what you see when you click on the Windows start button), they sound to be just as they should be. Those are not files you see; they are shortcuts to the various programs on your computer. Messenger will not work,
 so you might as well right-click on it in the start menu and select <em>Uninstall</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Firedog, you've done it. My Livemail is OK again.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>And surely that&nbsp; Update is to blame for miniaturising the LiveMail icon.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I just didn't realise that the midget icon was the problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I tried what you suggested but realised that it is quicker to point to the icon (in Taskbar):&nbsp;<em>then right click the mini image that comes up and choose 'maximise'.</em></strong></p>
<p>The image gets enlarged to normal size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's it. The email worked fine after that. All the folders and contacts are intact.</p>
<p>I was about to re-install the Livemail from the link. Thank God I didn't and awaited the arrival of your wisdom.</p>

<h2>            My windows 10 Home single-language has problem with non-unicode program</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I've struggling through this problem since the beginning of windows8 I thought problem would be gone by upgrade to windows 10, I'm wrong. The problem still exist as you may seen in the picture. Some of its display correctly, some is not.
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4f47529-e48c-4614-9dc9-8067b42fa47e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The language for this program is Thai. I've already set "Language for non-unicode programs" as Thai already, but still problem exists. I have the windows 10 pro version installed on the other PC which does show display language beautiful after I change this
 setting. But not for this windows 10 Home-Single Language.<br />
<br />
I have no solutions so far, so I came for you for help.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Neil</p>

            1) The program I'm having a trouble with is an attendance management software: coming along with the finger print scanner and card scanner.<br />
<br />
2) I haven't found any issue with other program so far since the other software I'm using are typical software as Office,AutoCAD etc. However, This software, though as specific software, did not has any issues on display language(as shown above) in the windows
 10 pro or 8.1 pro version installed on my other PC. I have no other PC running with Home-single language so I would have my finger cross once I said that the cause of the issue is by the edition of the software.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Neil<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Memory Management BSOD several times a hour</h2>
                    <p>In the past week my PC has begun to crash multiple times each hour with a Memory Management BSOD. &nbsp;Occasionally it will throw a BAD POOL BSOD, but these are rare happened twice in probably 60 BSODs. &nbsp;I've uninstalled everything I can think of, physically
 cleaned the PC/insides, re-seated memory and cables, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running sfc /scannow but it always stops or the memory management BSOD stops it. &nbsp;Below is what I get when it stops on its own.</p>
<p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 35% complete.<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Anymore tips? I have tried what has been suggested and my pc ran fine all day. I went out for lunch and brought it out of sleep when i got home. &nbsp;Now it is random bsod everytime windows attempts to start. &nbsp;I had a critical process failure, attempt to acces
 read only memory, a nfts etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition it now will not boot windows without safe mode. &nbsp;Ran scannow in safemode but it stips at 60% and says it cannot fix issue, also getting the memory management bsod in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to restart in hidden admin/safe now and running chkdisk</p>

<h2>            Skype-to-phone immediately fails</h2>
                    <p>All calls from Skype to telephones immediately fail.&nbsp; I can't figure out what the problem is!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe that this is a hardware issue, as I've updated Skype to the latest versions and I have the same problem across multiple devices (Windows 10, MacOS, iPhone 7, and Galaxy S7).&nbsp; It is not a funds issue---I have a valid subscription for Unlimited
 US calls as well as funds on my account.&nbsp; It is not an internet issue.&nbsp; I have plenty of bandwidth to do video streaming, video calls, etc., and the same issue occurs on other fast connections.&nbsp; Skype-to-Skype calls work fine, and so do SMS messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you are able to use Skype?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Vijay's&nbsp;recommendation, I&nbsp;would like to clarify if you are experiencing the same issue with all contacts that you have tried to call or is it only happening with one contact?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have tried to use the Skype for web, could you also try using the Skype Preview version or the official release&nbsp;and see if the same would still persist. You can download the official release of the Skype app using this link:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are reinstalling to a machine with UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One big difference between standard Bios and UEFI Bios is that UEFI Bios requires a GPT type disk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to install windows on to a UEFI machine the installation must be done from a specific type of bootable Flash Drive... a DVD might be able to work, but would require a lot of changes to your machines settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install using a DVD you need to DELETE the disk and then INITIALIZE it as a MBR instead of GPT... But you may get an error that way as well, again, because of the UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest thing to do would be to get a ISO Image of Win 8.1 Pro and put it on a bootable Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a tool called RUFUS to create the Flash Drive of at least 4gb, and preferably 8gb... The Flash Drive needs to be Formatted as FAT32, and not NTFS...</p>
<p>This is a requirement for the UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You MIGHT be able to use your DVD to create the Flash Drive with RUFUS, but I have never tried or even checked...</p>

            <p>So, the firsf time i also tried to do with a flash drive but after a while it said it wasnt a valid boot drive, so i plugged it in another pc and checked it. I tried to formatt it but i wasnt able to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats why i used the dvd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But ill try your solution.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With UEFI Bios you can't use the Windows tools for creating a bootable Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It needs to be done with a tool like RUFUS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason being is that the Windows tools create a NTFS Flash Drive, and it needs to be FAT32 to work with the UEFI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a specific process... you can't just copy the file to the drive...</p>

    <title>Several issues about screen &#40;brightness, color temperature, touch, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wylht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Several issues about screen &#40;brightness, color temperature, touch, pen, and so on&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I know that these issues have been reported by other people, but I encountered more than one issues. And some of my issues are different from others.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, my screen brightness level break this morning. No one else has mentioned this. It just go dark from time to time, even if I turn off the auto adjust brightness. It just dim for 1 second, then normal, then dim, then normal. Really driving me
 crazy. </p>
<p>Then you guess what? When it&nbsp;went dim, I noticed that the system brightness level was set to 25% for 1 second! During the winking, the brightness level bar just jumped from 25% to 75% every second!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem: color temperature is not stable. </p>
<p>1. As everyone says, scrolling in Edge or other program would have a chance to change the color temperature of whole screen</p>
<p>2. The most strange thing is, even I didn't scroll the screen, the temperature could change too! Maybe related to the video advertisement on the webpage, which just occupies such a little area of screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third problem: screen black out</p>
<p>When scroll something (for example, last time I encountered this problem is in "Get Started" App. ) to the end or beginning, the whole screen would go to dark completely!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fourth problem: lose pen/touch screen</p>
<p>There&nbsp;is a time that both my touch screen and pen cannot work. I have to use the keyboard to restart my surface.</p>
<p>But another situation occurred more frequently: just the pen can't work. </p>
<p>Note: I am sure that I have Bluetooth enabled, and the pen is not hibernating. Because when I press the end of the pen, OneNote can come out, I just can't&nbsp;use my pen to write anything!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fifth problem: display driver break&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I want to add more: Hyper-V is disabled at my computer. So don't tell me to deal with it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You really should tell intel&nbsp;to fix their damned display driver ASAP. </p>

 to edge on my machine.&nbsp; Microsoft please update Edge to fix this behavior!</p>

            <p>I had the screen brightness flashing issue before. I found out the reason was that I was charging my Blackberry Passport (Yes, I use a blackberry) using the USB connector on the surface pro 4 brick. So what is happening is that the brick doesn't have enough
 amp to charge both device at the same time. The charging indicator with the white light at connector also flashes in this situation. I also tried to charge my BT earbuds which works fine simultaneously with the surface charging brick. So my conclusion is that
 BB passport needs more amp to charge, and surface pro 4 charger can't do both at the same time.</p>

            <p>Well, my occasion is different. I didn't see the light of charger flashing. </p>
<p>And the power supply could not explain why the brightness level changing from 25% to 75% from time to time.
</p>
<p>I read about some posts about the same problem of Surface Pro 3, at that time, this is a bug of Intel's display driver. The temporary solution is to install Intel's display driver control panel, and turn off the energy saving setting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, the brightness issue haven't occurred for last 2 days. I hope it won't occur in the future.

            <p>Totally agree with what Jin Wang said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a case where my SP4's screen kept flashing bright/dim. &nbsp;Tried just about everything including turning off HyperV. &nbsp;Also saw in settings that the brightness bar kept jumping. &nbsp;Then noticed the light on the power connector going on and off, as well as
 the battery gauge in the notification bar saying "Charging/Not Charging" even though it did see the power as being plugged in the whole time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed that I have my Galaxy Note Edge plugged into the SP4 brick's USB port. &nbsp;As it is a high drain phone (which was low on battery at the time so actively charging), I unplugged it. &nbsp;Poof! &nbsp;Problem went away... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can totally confirm that - at least in my case - the screen flicker issue was totally due to too much draw from a device plugged into the USB port on the power brick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, IMHO - this is an issue with the power brick, as if its designed to allow a USB device to draw 1A @ 5v, a the device should not be able to draw more than 1A, nor should anything drawing 1A @5v in any way affect the ability of the power brick to
 adequately charge the SP4. &nbsp;At worse, if a USB device is drawing too much, the adapter should shut it off, and not reduce power to the Surface below what it needs to charge. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 top line of the screen flickering</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a SB2 and recently I've seen that the top line of the screen flickers. You can see it well if you open one chrome tab in Incognito mode.</p>
<p>It's just the top line of the screen that keeps flickering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed other threads about this as it seems to be a known problem but I never found a solution. I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) To download the latest Intel driver to open the Intel Graphics Control Panel: the latest driver available 25.20.100.6519 but when it execute it says that the verion is not compatible with my device (which is wrong because intel core I7-8650U is inside
 the list of the device that can accept the update). So I cannot open the Intel Graphics Driver and try to change come settings (someone says that disabling the panel self refresh will solve the problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I tried to update to the latest NVidia driver, current driver installed is 417.35, when I try to install the latest&nbsp; version (418.81) it says that the device is not compatible with the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please give me a solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this machine but I have to bring it back to the store if I can't solve the problem. It's really annoyng.</p>

<p>If you recently purchased the SB2, I'd much rather return it and get something else. Apparently this issue started with the SB1.</p>
<p>I'm not about to return every single graphics card that has performance issues as there is sure to be some update in the near future that'd fix said issues but the same can not be said about the SB line. It's literally been years without even so much as
 an acknowledgement that such problems exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are bound to get some cookie cutter "Diable Hyper-V" response, I guarantee it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, If you want to disable Intel's Self-Panel Refresh which fixes this flicker gate issue at the cost of your battery life, you must download the zip file, not the exe.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27199/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-15-47-?product=124968</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you have to roll back to 2017's build because I can't find the zip for the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloading:</p>
<ol>
<li>extract it</li><li>search device manager and locate your display adaptor</li><li>right click and update driver</li><li>click "Browse my computer for driver software"</li><li>&nbsp;click "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer"</li><li>&nbsp;click "Have Disk"</li><li>&nbsp;navigate to the extracted files and find the .dll</li><li>&nbsp;Download and restart</li><li>&nbsp;right click desktop and click on power options</li><li>&nbsp;disable self panel refresh.</li><li>&nbsp;no more flickering but terrible battery life</li><li>&nbsp;return the device because even with the driver you'll realize that SB auto updates and you'll lose the intel graphics panel anyway and the flicker will return.</li></ol>

<h2>            Skype Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The new version of Skype for Windows 10 does not have the same functionality as my older version, which now just tells me it cant sign in at the moment. This has only happened since the last new update of Windows 10. What's more annoying is that it doesn't
 appear you can load an older version as it just tells you you have to download the product from the Windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not meet my requirements so now I cant use Skype. I know there are others available, but this is really annoying and very much a retrograde step by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How and where can I load an older version which will work.</p>

<p>May I know how can I buy a Windows 8 Enterprise license key to activate my Windows PC?</p>

<p>All my searches point to other versions of Windows but I can't find the Enterprise one so which key do I have to buy to activate it?</p>

</p><p>You can't buy a Windows 8 Enterprise License.</p>
<p>Enterprise is sold via Volume Licensing/Software Assurance and that is for Corporations who buy multiple Licensing.</p>
<p>Enterprise is not for private use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try Amazon.com, but buy 8.1 as support for Windows 8 has ended.</p>

            You can't buy a key for the Enterprise version.&nbsp; Presumably you have a license for the OS originally installed by the manufacturer, and that version can be reinstalled.&nbsp; Contact the manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that, your only (legal) option is to purchase
 a key for whatever version you want and you PC is capable of running.<br />

<p>What I am saying is that there is no way for&nbsp;you to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Enterprise on your machine as a private user (unless it was the trial evaluation edition for 90 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained why you could not buy a Key for it and advised you where to buy a Key:</p>

</p><p><em><strong>Try Amazon.com, but buy 8.1 as support for Windows 8 has ended.</strong></em></p>

<p>1. You bought a computer that had NO operating system installed.</p>
<p>2. You installed a TRIAL edition of Windows Enterprise.</p>
<p>3. The TRIAL has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Amazon.com and BUY Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>2. Clean install your newly BOUGHT Windows 8.1, which process will remove the Windows Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can't install 10 for free from Windows ENTERPRISE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go and buy either Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, as neither are free for you, as you have an EXPIRED TRIAL of Enterprise.</p>

<h2>            I have a Gateway M 6843 laptop that I just installed a new hard drive on and now I can&#39;t get windows update to work.</h2>
                    My laptop came with Vista and I upgraded to Windows 7 about a year after I bought it. I cloned my old hard drive to the new one and windows update was working fine on the old one before the cloning. THe message reads "windows update cannot currently check
 for updates, because the systwm is not running. You may need to restart your computer." I have gone to services and started windows update and it still doesn't work. I tried windows troubleshooter and it says it fixed the problems, But it still doesn't work.
 Does anyone now of anthing else to try?

Thanks for yr prompt reply. I have an iMac OS X Lion 10.7.3 with 21.5" monitor.&nbsp; I have partitioned via BootCamp in imac and installed Windows 7.&nbsp; The text distortion occurs when running gaming software in Win 7.&nbsp; How do I update the latest display drivers?
 Not too sure about this side of things.&nbsp; Do I manually download them from Apple website or Microsoft or both? Where would I find them? Tks once again.

            <p>I don't know what a clean boot is so I can't test. A lot of clean up utilities are out there, why not use one of them?&nbsp;It sounds like you don't know what SRTSPX is. If SRTSPX is part of symantec why not just delete it? I must rely on people, like you, who
 know much more about Computers than&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp; Like most, you guys have strong opinions on what is good or bad, right or wrong, useful or not useful so it is hard to sift through the cloud of opinion to what will work best for me. I truly admire those of you who
 know so much about computing, I find it hard to not try it all. </p>
<p>The Clean up utility deletes unnecessary&nbsp;STUFF, rearranges necessary STUFF &amp; defragments necessary&nbsp;STUFF&nbsp;with one click so I'll use it until I get more info.</p>
<p>I don't mean any of what I say here to diminish my appreciation of your help. Thank you</p>
<p>PS Thanks to you,&nbsp;I'm going to keep but ignore I have SRTSPX because AVG, Internet Explorer &amp; the&nbsp;Windows Web Site could not provide a solution/explanation of the mysterious synbol.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I tried the above list and I still have the problem. We even installed Windows Live 2011 and still have same error.<br />
<br />
We did find this on a forum :<br />
<br />
This is a known bug we are tracking. The bug is most apparent when<br />
connecting to <a href="http://www.winvistatips.com/keep-loosing-connection-my-imap-server-t365725.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">servers</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.intellitxt.com%2fast%2fadTypes%2ficon1.png" /></span></a>
 that have short default timeouts. If you have access,<br />
you can try changing the timeout limit on the server (I don't know if your<br />
particular server supports this). This won't fix the problem, but it would<br />
hopefully lessen its effect on you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.<br />
<br />
Parminder<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After our support specialist checked the information that you've provided, we advice you to double check if your IMAP settings are correct. To do this, you can ask iomartmail.com for the following settings.&nbsp;After making the changes,&nbsp;we would like you to
 try reconfiguring your account within Windows Live Mail. To do this, you can follow the steps within this

 the issue if this is an email-server related issues or Windows Live Mail program issue.</p>

            <p>I constantly have this problem and know my server settings for IMAP are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Short of switching to Thunderbird for my email - and Thunderbird does work without these constant annoying messages - why doesn't the Live Team just disable the alert the user would get if this problem occurs OR give users of Windows Live Mail the option
 to disable the alert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to have to use two different applications as I also use the calendar in Windows Live. But when this dialog pops up, it takes several clicks to dismiss it. To be precise in what I mean, the dialog pops up and the default error sound is heard,
 I click on OK to dismiss it and it pops up again at least 4 to 5 times before it will go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with this happening numerous times throughout the day, it is a real irritation.

<h2>            Xbox one suddenly not detecting external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; My Xbox one recently stopped detecting my external hard drive (SeaGate 2TB) after working fine for almost a year. I've tried every port and done several hard re-sets. Any advice? Please help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Justine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there is an issue with an external hard drive being detected, and we would enjoy to be of assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest to follow the procedures provided here at our <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to restart or power cycle your Xbox One console</a></strong> article, and
 as a last resort we suggest our <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Soft Factory Reset</a></strong> the console by selecting:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</span></strong><span>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your
 games or apps. This will save you from downloading or reinstalling the large game files. In some cases, if a corrupt game file is causing the issue you're troubleshooting, you may have to choose
</span><strong>Reset and remove everything</strong><span>, but you should always start with
</span><strong>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</strong><span> and save </span>
<strong>Reset and remove everything</strong><span> as a last resort.</span></p>

<p>If nothing they told you works, because I had the same issue and none of these steps worked, your console may be getting ready to take a dirt nap.&nbsp; Mine happened a couple months ago immediately after an Alpha dashboard update.&nbsp; After
 all these steps, I wanted to see if there was an issue with the hard drive or the connecting wires.&nbsp; So I plugged it into my PC and reformatted it to the computer.&nbsp; It was being recognized by my PC, so I ran system diagnostics and everything was coming up
 fine.&nbsp; I'd take it back to the XBox, and it would recognize it and I'd be prompted to let myself know they have to reformat it again.&nbsp; For a short while it recognized it, but anything saved to it would not load or would partially load where you have clothes
 running around no bodies and transparents floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a couple days ago, I started getting complete system freezes that required complete hard resets.&nbsp; Usually would happen every two hours.&nbsp; A day before that, I experienced extreme controller drifting.&nbsp; I went to support on Saturday evening and they wanted
 to have me send it in for repairs and charge me $159 for it and give me a 30 day warranty on the repairs.&nbsp; That was ridiculous so I opted to buy a new system and get the 3 year warranty because it covered controllers; because the controllers are trash and
 seem to fall apart after 6 months of use.&nbsp; I think I've had to buy 6 over 4 years.&nbsp; Anyway, just today, I get home from work and when I start up my system, I get a 10 minute green screen and then the screen turns black and I get a message saying "Try again
 later.&nbsp; XBox systems services are down."&nbsp; It doesn't have an error code.&nbsp; It says just check the website for service alerts and everything is working.&nbsp; So I think my system is dead.&nbsp; It all started with nothing being able to fix my XBox not recognizing my
 external hard drive 2 months ago.&nbsp; Just something you might want to prepare yourself for; hopefully, that isn't the case.</p>

<p>Hey Justine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had a similar issue with a 1TB Seagate. Mine worked for about a year and a half and suddenly the xbox wouldn't detect it. I tried all the troubleshooting and everything and nothing worked. I came to the conclusion that unfortunately the external
 drive had given up and corrupted. Try connecting it to a computer. If it detects it, it may be salvageable however if it does not it is most likely corrupt. Most Seagate drives have at least a 1 year warranty so you may want to look into seeing if you can
 get it replaced. Since most xbox games save game progress to the cloud you likely won't lose any game progress but you may have to redownload your games that were saved to it. I wound up just buying a new external drive to replace the old one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is corrupt and isn't covered by warranty, try going with a Western Digital external hard drive. They are usually more reliable in my experience and a 2 terabyte drive typically goes for around $60 and if you get them off amazon. If you don't have Amazon
 prime you might want to check out Newegg as well because they offer free 3 day shipping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Nate</p>

<p>Do you have a PC you can connect it to and if so, is it detected if you hook it up to that? If it's a Windows PC you'll have to look in Disk Management for the drive as it won't show in File Explorer due to it being formatted for use with the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've tried all of the following.....</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Hard resetting the console</li><li>A different USB port on the console</li><li>A different USB cable</li><li>A factory reset</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>….and the drive is still recognised normally in Disk Management in Windows, then you're probably going to have to format the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this happen twice now, with different drives, and in both cases, none of the standard troubleshooting steps worked, however, the drives were recognised when connected to my PC and once I'd formatted them in Windows, when I connected them back to
 my Xbox, they were recognised as normal. Once I'd formatted them on the Xbox for use as storage, they worked as normal from then on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously it's a pain, because you will lose all of the data on the drive and have to re-download it, but it's definitely worth trying as a last resort. Definitely don't assume that the drive is faulty before trying that anyway.</p>
