    <title>Is there a way to make it obvious which window has focus on a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod at work  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to make it obvious which window has focus on a multi-monitor Windows system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If there's anything that makes me want to pick up my computer and throw it out the window, its when a window which I did
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> think had focus, starts responding to commands I'm typing into another window which I thought
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">did</span> have focus; only to discover I've made a mistake. Yes, ultimately I'm the one at fault. I get that. But man, when I'm doing something like watching a Pluralsight video on one monitor and I try to duplicate
 the code in Visual Studio on another monitor and find that instead I'm issuing commands to the Pluralsight video control, that really frustrates me! And unfortunately I do it way too often, thus my reason for posting this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there some way, some setting I can make in Windows, so that when any window had focus its more visually obvious? Of course I still want to be able to read another window either on the same monitor or another monitor, but I just want to be able to see,
 at a glance, that for example the browser window with the Pluralsight video controller now has focus, not my instance of Visual Studio. Something like maybe the windows title is more bold, or a different color, or anything at all to make it obvious.</p>

            Hi Jesse,
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />You can download the Windows 10 ISO form this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />And create the bootable USB drive using this tool from Microsoft:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you can do none of the above, are you having issues with your Windows 10, that you need to re-install Windows 10 - have you tried just Resetting Windows?
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            All good advice. My problem is that my hard drive needs to be recovered through windows reccovery, so no boot logo. Like I said I'm stranded. I would root my phone and start from there butbut I've got the only pc in the world I guess haha. I REALLY NEED
 A Physical copy. If you could mail me one idea love you for it. Maybe use an old USB and rufus, and a couple 10 cent stamps.

<h2>            Does American Conquest Anthology work on Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I guess that was somewhat of a rhetorical question cause every time I try and open the game, I only get a black screen with the game music playing in the background. The real question is: what can I do to get it to work? Changing the compatibility settings
 don't seem to work. Its a shame to spend all that money on PC games only to realize that they don't work in the future...kinda kills the game...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>If you are referring to the American Conquest developed by GSC Game World and published by CDV I'm sorry to say the games were not designed for later versions of the Windows Operating System. Its good that you tried the Compatibility settings already as
 in most cases this resolves issues for older programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I request you to contact the game developer to see if they have any updates or a way you can run the game on later operating systems.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do get back to us if you have any other questions.</div>

            <p>Hi, Ammar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand correctly, you're primarily interested in being able to type text in Arabic and use various Arabic fonts, but not necessarily be able to see the Windows user interface displayed in Arabic. All of these are possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you want to add the Arabic language to your user language settings in the Settings app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Start button.</li><li>Click on Settings.</li><li>Click on Time &amp; language</li><li>Click on&nbsp;Region &amp; language</li></ul>
<p>Under the Languages heading, if you do not see any regional variety of Arabic listed, then you can add that now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the "+" icon next to Add a language.</li><li>Locate Arabic in the list (you may need to scroll); click on Arabic.</li><li>The view will change to show several regional varieties of Arabic. Find the one that best matches your needs and click on it.</li></ul>
<p>At this point, you will be taken back to the Region &amp; language page that shows your language preferences, with Arabic at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding Arabic to your language profile will have several effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have enabled an Arabic keyboard. There are different keyboard layouts available for Arabic; to choose a different layout, click on Arabic in the list, then click on Options to get to more detailed settings for Arabic.</li><li>Additional, optional&nbsp;Windows features relevant to Arabic language will be installed from Windows Update. (You need to be online for these to be installed.) These will include typing enhancements, such as text prediction, and&nbsp;several additional fonts that
 support Arabic script.</li><li>When you browse Web sites, browsers will indicate to the site your language preference, which now will include Arabic.</li><li>When you run Windows Store apps, they may be able to display their user interface in Arabic.</li><li>You have the option of having the Windows user interface display in Arabic. On the Region &amp; language page, where you see Arabic in your language preferences, it may display, "Language pack available"; if so, then you can install this to set your Windows
 user interface to display in Arabic. If you would like to do that, click on Arabic, then click Options. You'll see a button to install the language pack in the detailed options view.</li></ul>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>OK, I understand. However at 15-20 minutes for start up? That's a crazy amount of time. I'm now at 15 or so minutes. I'll let it keep going. It's not locked up, because I see the center of the X (in the Xbox one logo) Pulsing like a heart beat. I have no
 problem waiting. I would have thought they would have mentioned a possible 30 min boot up time. But that's just me.</p>

    <title>Dual tuner Cinergy 2400i DT issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mditerli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual tuner Cinergy 2400i DT issue</h2>
                    Hi I am looking to this forum about dual TV tuners in Windows 7 Media Center.<br />
Terratec Cinergy 2400i DT is a true dual-tuner PCI-E card, it was working without problems with my old Windows XP MCE edition 2005.<br />
With Windows 7 Media Center I have the following situation.<br />
Installation / configuration / TV setup... no problems. It is recognized as 2 different tuners and allows me to record and watch both channels.<br />
However, AFTER I do a recording on BOTH channels at the same time (which is ok when I look at the recorded files), when I stop the recording, it seems that the tuner channels are still busy. When I want to see the TV again, it tells me that the tuner is busy
 and there are no channels free - the same screen I get when I try to look at a third TV channel while 2 recordings are in progress.<br />
It seem there is something "locking" the tuner like when the recording is in progress, but the recordings are stopped !<br />
Note this only happens&nbsp;AFTER I do a recording on both channels at the same time, if I use only one channel for recording, when I stop it everything is ok I can do further watching / recording on any channels.<br />
I tried to contact Terratec about the drivers, but they answered the problem is likely due to Media Center issue and not the device itself.<br />
Did you hear about this problem ?<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

            Installed Terratec Home Cinema, last version downloaded from Terratec website.<br />
<br />
With this software, I still&nbsp;had problems with dual tuner setup. Channel scan reports 130 DVB-T channels, but only for Tuner 2. No way to work with Tuner 1, which is recognized but appears to be stuck and unuseable.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I re-installed the older drivers for XP and Vista, version 1.1.0.283a. With this version, also Media Center is working as expected, after recording on 2 channels at the same time, the tuner is free and I can have two channels available for watching
 TV while recording, or recording again 2 channels at the same time.<br />
<br />
So is seems the problem was the "new" drivers.<br />
<br />

<p>Sometimes Xbox gives you a free $5 or $10 xbox gift card.&nbsp; In the last 2 years I have recieved $10 gift card from Microsoft via Xbox Live messages.&nbsp; And sometimes developers have promotions where they give out in game credits.&nbsp; For example, you can be enter
 to win Apex credit from watching certain streams on MiXer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, i doubt they recieved 7560 free credit pack.&nbsp; Rainbow Six Siege charges $10 for 1200 in game credit.&nbsp; Also, from google it seems like Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975.&nbsp; So I am thinking that would be Microsoft birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Calum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing Microsoft usually gives out, are rewards for gamer score, quests or occasionally on holiday like Christmas. They usually only give out Microsoft/Xbox currency. There are other ways you can earn credits for games but they usually involve purchasing
 gold or game pass. I will go ahead and lock this thread as to prevent repetitive answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi  GooDLooKin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your microphone
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio recording is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Click the machine name at the top
<br />Click Action menu
<br />Click Scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />See if the sound controllers appear at the bottom.
<br />
<br />If not, click the View menu then click 
<br />Show hidden devices 
<br />
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback tab
<br />Right click your headset
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already

            Hi  DonTinc 
<br />
<br />Use the following tool to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Hi kilsonmuchuchuti 
<br />
<br />Basically, any Mic that your android device can see can be used with Skype.
<br />
<br />It is a personal choice, do you want a Bluetooth mic or a wired mic, or do you want a mic attached to a headset?

<p>You change the sending size of the photos that you want to email.</p>

    <title>Focused Inbox for Gmail in Mail App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samuelmassey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Focused Inbox for Gmail in Mail App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Setting up my new Surface Pro 4. Mail App (the one like Outlook for mobile devices; not Outlook for desktop) does not offer a focused inbox for my Gmail account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unified inbox would be great, but I need to have the focused inbox for the other (exchange) account. So right now I have to choose between one or the other. A web search brings up announcements from April 2017&nbsp;that say focused/other splitting is rolling
 out for Gmail. It's been months since those&nbsp;announcements were posted. Should I expect that it would be available to me by now?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already added Gmail to Office Outlook on the same PC, which required setting up two-factor authentication for the Gmail account. Could that have anything to co with the inability of the Mail App to&nbsp;generate a focused&nbsp;inbox for my Gmail?</p>

<h3> sachin khedkar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wndows 10 shows Disk usage - 100&#37; and hangs</h2>
                    <p>I own Lenovo Z51 laptop with Windows 10 license installed. It was working fine for a year. Since last two months I am facing a strange issue, in which my system freezes when I do a right click on windows explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue :&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Start / Restart Machine.</p>
<p>2. Start task manager (start + r --&gt; taskmgr). Check the disk usage -- &nbsp; It shows 100%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here I have just booted the system and the only app is running is <strong>task manager.</strong> Still the system specifies that all disk has been used. Both the drives on the PC are more than 60% empty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I wait for half an hour, the disk usage comes down to 50%, then if I do a right click on windows explorer, again the trouble starts. Disk usage - 100% &nbsp;and the screen freezes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nowadays I am afraid to right click to check folder details/permissions. Don't know when the system will get frozen on clicking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
System Config -&nbsp;<br />
RAM - 8GB</p>
<p>Processor - Intel Core i5 (3rd Gen)</p>
<p>HDD - 1TB</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Request - Please find solution to the issue and provide update.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft community forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the steps provided and check with the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start the&nbsp;all the dependencies service&nbsp;for the&nbsp; printer spooler service. Follow the steps provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows key + R and type services.msc in the search field and press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Scroll down to<strong> Print spooler.</strong><br />
3. Right click and click <strong>properties</strong>, click the tab “<strong>Dependencies</strong>”<br />
4. Note all of the <strong>dependent</strong> services listed, and then close the<strong> Print Spooler Properties</strong> window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If any of the dependent services are missing or cannot be started, try uninstalling all installed printer drivers and then reinstalling them.<br />
</p>Check if the issue persists.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to check if you have downloaded the appropriate driver for the printer device. You may refer this article:

            <p>Many thanks. I am being delayed installing the drivers and software suggested. This is not the driver I was using , I&nbsp;was using the driver from the Australian site, same version. The printer is on the wireless network I am using however this is the problem,
 The setup loads drivers and software and everything during the setup goes fine until it goes searching for the printer. During the setup I selected a wireless printer existing on the network and I can ping the IP OK, but the setup says it cannot find it. &nbsp;I
 then cancel out of the setup and reboot the computer. On start-up the printer setup continues where it left off and at this time the printer is found but indicates no drivers are loaded. Until I sort out this problem I can' check if this driver is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your recommendations regarding the services and all dependencies and they had been started with one exception it listed a HTTP service as a dependency, but no listed HTTP services beneath it so I assume that is OK. I am continuing to work on the
 printer installation in the meantime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Winston, </p>
<p>I think we can close this now, had problems loading the printer combo pack as described previously so removed all reference to the printer, manually extracted the combo file to a temp folder. From that I added the network printer and used the drivers that
 you suggested and loaded the rest of the package manually. All appears to be fine now, no errors no matter how many pages printed.
</p>
<p>Once again many thanks for getting back to me as quick as you did it is greatly appreciated.</p>

            I found the solution.All you have to do is delete Media Foundation Pipeline from system32 folder.Here it is how:start-run-cmd:t<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">ype "takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\mfpmp.exe"
 (without quotes) and press "Enter."</span><br />
 double-click the "C:"&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">drive</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">. Double-click
 the "</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Windows</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">" folder and double-click the
 "System32" folder.&nbsp;</span><br />
