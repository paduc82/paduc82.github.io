    <title>SSL VPN connection fails because CRL could not be downloaded - even - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SSL VPN connection fails because CRL could not be downloaded - even though you can download the CRL manually.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using Windows 7 Starter Edition on a newly purchased Acer netbook and am having problems setting up an SSL VPN connection.&nbsp; The vendor CRL list is a large one (currently 18MB - GoDaddy) and I've found that I can download the CRL manually (it takes about
 10 seconds to download on my high speed connection a full minute for the file to open).&nbsp; It appears the dialer is timing out due to the amount of time it takes to process the CRL locally by the Atom N450 cpu.</p>
Doing some Googling (sorry Bing), has led me to several cases where users are having similar problems but are working around it by modifying policy settings on the local machine.&nbsp; Given that my local computer is using Starter Edition (and you cannot modify
 policy settings), are their other registry values I can adjust to increase the timeout that is occurring?<br />

<h2>            lots of problems with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am having a number of problems with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after upgrading to 10 a while ago when every thing was working fine I now have several problems that I have been unable to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as many of the built in apps had stopped working I have done a fresh side install of windows 10 keeping apps and files as I wanted to keep my existing software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems are:</p>
<p>Store not working</p>
<p>indexing not working</p>
<p>an unknown device, on Intel(R) HM76 Express Chipset LPC Controller - 1E59</p>
<p>the file manager seems to slow down after the computer has run for a while and icons become slow to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the computer is a Sony vaio Sve1512m1ew </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried as many of the fixes as possible and the problem is still present with a clean boot with all third party services and start ups turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to purge the apps cache but can not, I get built-in&nbsp; administrator errors. the auto fix apps says nothing is wrong. sfc/scannow finds no errors to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any suggestions apart form go back to Windows 8.0 and start again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Go to the folder in which these files are located and right click on it and click on properties and click on Security.&nbsp; Add yourself with full rights permissions and check the box to apply to all files and sub--directories.&nbsp; Do the same in the Special Permissions
 folder under Advanced.&nbsp; Also in Advanced, click on Ownership and change the owner to yourself.&nbsp; Now see if you have any better luck with those files.</p>
<p>Here's some additional information on permissions and ownership that may help.</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give
 yourself full rights.&nbsp; Right click the folder/drive, click on properties, go to the security tab and click on Advanced and then click on the Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it
 if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive
 and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If that still doesn't work, it is possible that these downloaded files are somehow encrypted or programmed in such a way as to prevent anything but viewing
 after the initial download.&nbsp; Try downloading a few more files from the same location and see if those files have the same problem.&nbsp; If not, that download may have had some problems and I do not know how to fix them given that you can access essentiallly nothing
 about the files.&nbsp; This may be intentional on the part of the people providing those downloads and it may not be possible to override whatever restrictions they put in place for whatever reason (perhaps as a security measure to prevent people from copying the
 files or moving them from their original download source).&nbsp; Without being able to rename or right click to access properties, you cannot make changes to these files and I have no idea how other than mentioned above if that works here to do that as I have no
 idea how it was accomplished in the first place.&nbsp; If this problem is unique to this download site, I recommend you stop using it and find another alternative that doesn't cause this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>If you can play them, then I'm not sure why you would want to delete them, but if that's you're desire, t<span>ry
 using one of the following free products to delete the files.&nbsp; Unlocker at:</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></span></a></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>or
 File Assassin </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 or without Force Delete: </span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></span></a></span><span>).
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, I have no other suggestions to offer.&nbsp; Well, maybe one.&nbsp; Move everything else out of the folder (assuming it isn't in the root of the shell folder itself but in some folder you created - then don't try this) and then try to delete
 the entire folder and all its contents normally or using Unlocker.&nbsp; That's pretty much my last reasonable option.&nbsp; Every other option is somewhat radical and I'll present them if you want but the decision to try them will be entirely yours.&nbsp; They all involve
 deleting the files and not gaining access to them - for the latter I do not have any other suggestions.</span></span><span><span><br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

            I realie that.&nbsp;I do not understand why this is happening beyond what I guessed might be the cause as noted in my prior post (but that doesn't help us find a solution).&nbsp; Nothing I suggestd requires you to right click on these files (I considered that when
 selecting the options I proposed).&nbsp; Are you saying you can't right click on the folders either?

<p>There might be some problem with your registry. Download the Auslogics registry cleaner for that and i think that it will do the trick.</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, make sure that you are logged in administrator account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>The minidump files were inconclusive however looking at the raw stack of drivers there was activity from AVG drivers in particular the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=avgidsdrivera.sys&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=&amp;oe=&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=3qF2V_3GPOSM8QflvpPAAg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">avgidsdrivera.sys</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I might suggest is to uninstall, at least temporarily, AVG and see if the BSOD resolves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards you could try reinstalling AVG or use alternative security software such as Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#47;Word issue</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 this afternoon.&nbsp; I needed to edit a Word document after the upgrade but it won't allow me to save anything.&nbsp; Instead I see a box which says that I need administrator permission - but it is MY laptop and I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>am</strong></span> the admin!&nbsp; At this point, I am unable to save anything and all Word docs open in Read Only mode.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp;

            <p>Excellent, to fix your Documents folder, you'll need to adjust your security permissions on the folder.&nbsp; I can't really say how it got messed up, but this should fix it.&nbsp; These steps are a bit involved, but just take it step-by-step (some users print them
 and mark off what step they've done).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get stuck, just let me know what step you're on.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows+R to show the Run box.</li><li>Type (or copy/paste) &nbsp;<strong>%userprofile%</strong>&nbsp; (including the percent signs) into the box and hit OK to open your user profile folder.</li><li>Right-click the Documents folder and go to Properties.</li><li>On the&nbsp;Security tab, click Advanced.</li><li>At the top, make sure the "owner"&nbsp;is set to your account.&nbsp; If it already is, please skip to step 6.<br />
<ul>
<li>A.&nbsp; If the owner is not you, click Change.</li><li>B.&nbsp; Click Advanced</li><li>C.&nbsp; Click Find Now</li><li>D.&nbsp; Select (highlight) your account in the list (it may be a name or email address depending on your setup), then click OK to close the search box.</li><li>E.&nbsp; Click OK again to close the "select a user" box.</li><li>F.&nbsp; Turn ON checkbox for "replace owner on subcontainers and objects" (this makes sure you are the owner for
<em>everything</em> under your documents folder also).</li><li>G.&nbsp; After the checkbox is on, click OK close the "advanced security" box.</li><li>H.&nbsp; Click OK again to close the Documents Properties box.&nbsp; At this point, you should be back where you were after step 2 when you opened the User Profile folder.</li><li>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the Documents folder again, and go back to properties,</li><li>J. &nbsp;On the Security tab, click Advanced, then continue with step 6 below.</li></ul>
</li><li>Click "Add"</li><li>Click "Select a principal"</li><li>Click Advanced</li><li>Click Find Now</li><li>Select (highlight) your account in the list (it may be a name or email address depending on your setup), then click OK to close the search box.</li><li>Click OK again to close the "select a user" box</li><li>Turn on "Full Control" checkbox.</li><li>Click OK to close the Permission Entry box.</li><li>Click OK again to close the "Advanced Security" box.</li><li>Click OK again to close the Documents Properties box.&nbsp; At this point, you should be back to where you were after step 2 when you opened the User Profile folder.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now, double-click the Documents folder to go inside.&nbsp; Try opening any file you have, making a minor change and clicking "Save" to see if it saves properly now that you have "full control" over everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again I know these are long steps.&nbsp; As a word of caution, please do not try to do this on a larger scope (for example, if you tried this on your whole C: drive, you could destroy your OS, so only do it on Documents/Pictures folders and such to be safe).&nbsp;
 Also, never use the "Deny" options when setting permissions because those take precedence over the allows, meaning that you can permanently lock yourself out of a folder and never get back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Or, use this Easier Option:</p>
I'd really suggest an easier way out.&nbsp; It's not without a little work, but considering avoids issues from recurring and it would probably save you a lot of headache and be done faster anyway.&nbsp; So, that being said, I would:
<ol>
<li>Disconnect your online services from your current account<br />
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;- Go to Settings &gt; Accounts and click "Sign in with a local account instead". Follow the steps, and if you are prompted for a username, use something disposable like "oldaccount". You want to leave your actual desired username available for the next step.</li></ul>
</li><li>Create a new "local only user account" on your PC:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;- Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users &gt; Add Someone Else to this PC</li><li>B - Ignore the email box and click "the person I want to add doesn't have an email address" link at the bottom</li><li>C - Ignore the&nbsp;form up top,&nbsp;and click "add a user without a Microsoft Account" link at the bottom</li><li>D - Give your user account a name (use something short and sweet like "Henrik" as this will be the foundation of the user account folder; and you can give it a more "friendly" name later).</li></ul>
</li><li>After creating, switch to it by opening your Start menu and clicking your name at the top-left, then clicking the new account name on the drop-down menu that opens.</li><li>Inside the new account, setup OneDrive normally.&nbsp; It should not have any permissions issues inside this fresh user profile.</li><li>Open C:\Users and go into your old profile folder, and drag your documents/pictures/music/etc into your new profile.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's no rush to do so, but when you're comfortable with the new one and have it setup the way you want (and assuming all goes smoothly), you can go delete out the broken account.</p>
<p />

    <title>Number of participants on video Conferencing and Screen Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azarisfr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Number of participants on video Conferencing and Screen Sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>I am using the free version of skype. <br />
I need to know: <br />
<br />
1) Group screen sharing: <br />
How many people (max number) can attend and see my screen sharing?<br />
What happens if there are more than the max number of attendees?</p>
<p><br />
2) Video conference: <br />
a) How many people (max number) can see my video (if I am the only one with video), and
<br />
b) If all are using video, how many persons can attend? What happens if there are more than the max number of attendees?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is there any way to increase the max numbers? (with payment, Skype for business or that like?)</p>
<p><br />
This info should be easier accessible on the info pages to skype I think. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help :-)</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>1) I thought I have seen on Skypes internet pages that there should be a limit of 10 participants on a video or screen sharing session (but 25 with only audio, no video). Is this right? And does this include the presenter? What happens
 if there is 11 or more persons? They can just have audio (while the first 10 can also have video)? Or no one can have video? And what about screen sharing for more that 10 persons - not possible onece there is 11 persons attending (including the presenter)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>The maximum number of participants on a group call is
<strong>25 (24 plus yourself).&nbsp;</strong>This could be a mix of video and audio calls. The maximum number of participants with video streams would be 9 (plus the host) and the rest would be audio streams.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/group-screen-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Group screen sharing</a></strong> is also limited to 10. Yes, it would not be possible to exceed this limit. If you want to
 initiate screen sharing for more than 10 participants, you can try Skype for Business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, Skype for Business is included in Office 365 Business Essentials.&nbsp;<em>

<h2>            Why do I have to right-click, run as admin EVERY time I want to run an executable file wince I installed windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In every previous version of windows I have ever had, to run an exe file, I just double clicked it and it ran like its supposed to. Now that I "upgraded" from 8.1 to 10 I've had nothing but issues. Fried wifi card, programs not working anymore etc..... Now,
 every time i try to run an exe file I HAVE to right-click and run as admin or I get the message: Unable to execute file in the temporary directory.... error 5 access denied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I STOP this completely? How can I ALWAYS have admin rights? I don't wan to go into each file/folder and set them up and jump through all those hoops. I want the computer to know I'm the admin and everything I do should NOT need admin rights because
 I AM the admin. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>

            <p>Hello. Thank you for your reply. I have attached a few screen shots to show you what I am seeing. When I try to change my account type, I'm already listed as the Administrator. When I try the second option you mentioned, there also, I am the administrator
 already. I am the only user of this PC. I am using a Microsoft account. Not local. I am lost and don't know what else to do.&nbsp;

                    Outlook 2010 is, in my opinion, a thousand times nicer than later versions.&nbsp; However, people have had problems getting it to run on Windows 8, and I am concerned that by upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, that Outlook 2010 will not work.

<h2>            windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown - Event ID&#58; 6008</h2>
                    My laptop has been working normally until some hours ago. I turned it on without problems, opened firefox as I always do. I had maybe 4 open tabs though I tend to have many many maaany more open if I'm using it, but I had just started it, so only had a
 few, with some Facebook pages and yahoo search. It prompted an important Windows update, I selected it to download it and before it could finish it, it showed a problem and said it had failed. Since this have happened before without showing any bad consequences,
 I didn't really care. <br />
I remember deleting a video that I had downloaded yesterday though, while it was trying to download the Windows Update, but that's about it, I haven't installed any new hardware nor software.<br />
I wasn't near the computer nor the bedroom, but I was playing a song on Winamp and it was loud so I could listen to it from where I was standing. This happened for some minutes and then I heard a loud noise, I realized the song wasn't playing anymore and it
 was coming from the laptop so I ran towards it. It was showing the blue screen saying something like Windows must shut down to prevent damage, I think it showed a binary number but I can't say I got the chance to observe any further, I was panicking since
 it was the 1st time it happened, I didn't know what else to do but letting the computer handle it on its own. A few seconds after it restarted itself, everything loaded normally and then a dialogue box from Windows said something like windows has recovered
 from an unexpected shutdown and asked me if I wanted to let it check I dunno if it said possible solutions or a way for it not to happen again. Either way I said OK, and it seemed it was scanning and checking stuff but it didn't prompt anything else. Neither
 if the problem was found, nor if anything was fixed.<br />
I haven't turned the computer off yet. I had to leave after minutes of what happened, and when I was back I started browsing and checking for possible reasons. So far nothing seems to be the cause of it. I'm tempted to do a system restore and try to download
 that update again (definition update for windows defender kb915597 definition 1.153.1042.0) and see what happens but I'm clueless about what steps to take. By the way, I've tried to download it manually, but on the Microsoft site it doesn't show this particular
 definition... I doubt it's connected to what caused the shutdown but I point it out just in case.<br />
The temperature is OK as well according to Core Temp. At the moment for instance I have a gazillion open programs and tons of tabs not only in Firefox but also in Chrome and it shows 42ºC (says the max should be 90). I doubt it's a hardware problem. I have
 no clue though if it's connected to a driver, nor how I could find that out.<br />
I really don't know how to use the Event Viewer, since I'm less than a newb when it comes to computers. I double clicked item by item around the time when I remembered it happened and this seems to be the log of the aftermath.<br />

It all seems to be working fine so far. I went to Computer, selected the disc, left click properties, Tools, Error-checking - check now, but it'll do it on the next restart I think. Anyway, any help or clue would be much appreciated, thanks!<br />

            <p>I had a couple computers that did that sometimes. My gaming computer and my older Windows 2000 computer. My gaming computer is Windows 7 and Windows 8(multi-boot system). When my computer would crash like that, I usually freaked. Though, it always ran flawlessly
 afterwards, so I usually ignored it. I would only worry if the problem persists. Sometimes computers can become unstable. Sadly, I don't know entirely why. Mine has done it while I'm listening to music. It can also come from driver problems, but if you haven't
 installed any new hardware or software, then that's probably not the issue/cause. It can also come from program issues that can edit system settings too. That is smart of you to check your hard drive for errors, that can help and prevent other issues from
 coming up. I've noticed that if some computers are doing a lot, they can crash, my gaming computer is like sometimes. I doubt if it was caused by an update to Windows Defender, an update like that doesn't update system files(or it would have to restart the
 computer like other system updates). I've had Windows Defender updates fail on my Windows Vista computer rarely(though it would never lead to a crash).&nbsp;I would only use system restore if it crashes like that(blue screen of death) again.
</p>
<p><strong><u>If it persists</u></strong>, using system restore is an option, check for hard drive errors again(but try including the option about repairing bad sectors too), using your antivirus/antispyware update it and do a full scan, and if you want you
 can disk defragment your system(after all that checking and scanning, this will help speed&nbsp;your computer&nbsp;up).</p>

            I have Windows 7, I should follow the same steps, right? It's not a recurrent issue though, it happened yesterday and luckily it didn't happen again but I don't know what caused it, and I'd like to prevent it from happening again. The mini dumps would
 be enabled from now on, to show in a log what could cause it if it happened again, am I wrong? Or once enabled it can show information about the previous days, when they weren't enabled yet? Again, I apologize for my zero knowledge about these matters! And
 my broken English lol I point it out cause after that bluescreen and the reboot everything seemed to be normal really, thank goodness. If the enabled mini dumps could show what went on yesterday then certainly it could be useful. I'm scared about the automatically
 restart being disabled considering I would DIE if the computer freezes with a bluescreen lol I have no idea what to do, I let it act on its own cause I trusted Windows would know better than myself hehe<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm running Vaio Care, and it's checking the hard drive, it seems to be stuck there but since it says it can last at least 4 hours, I don't want to cancel it, just in case. I might have to leave the laptop on just for that. I tell this cause the
 reboot could be done tomorrow at this pace.<br />

            Same here. Well actually this was my 1st time facing a bluescreen since I've been using Windows 7. I was also listening to music :| I wonder what's the deal with that lol I'm intrigued by it precisely cause I wasn't 'abusing' the laptop as I always do,
 with lots of programs running at the same time, open files, doing this and that. I had only 2 programs running and I wasn't even in front of the laptop, it was idle for some minutes (it's not set to sleep, suspend nor anything).<br />
Yesterday after some hours of the restart after the shutdown I tried to use it as I always do, without mercy nor special considerations. especially cause then I was in front of it and I could observe if something was happening, but luckily it didn't happen
 again.<br />
Last night I restarted it so that it could check on the disc, cause I imagined it was going to take some time for that and I wanted to be present after it was done with it, but it was extremely slow since I had selected both Automatically fix file system errors
 and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. I gave up waiting after maybe an hour and it showed only 16% of the 3rd step (out of 5 steps I think). I figured it was gonna take forever so I went to sleep and left it doing it. When I woke up windows was
 loaded as usual, no dialog boxes were open nor showing any form of interaction. What happened after that local disc check I'll never know lol All seemed normal again, just like yesterday after the shutdown.<br />
I've also had Windows defender updates failing a few times before, and it never caused any issues.<br />
Not sure if you still use Windows, but I'll ask anyway. On Device Installation Settings (Control Panel - hardware and Sound - Devices and Printers -&nbsp; right click on your PC - Device Installation settings), it says: do you want windows to download driver software
 and realistic icons for your devices? I have checked: No, let me choose what to do - Install driver software from windows update if it is not found on my computer.<br />
Should I change it to 'Yes, do this automatically (recommended)'? Considering the possibility of a driver causing what happened yesterday. Except that Windows Update finds those same updates and those are the ones which ends up offering to download. I prefer
 doing a few more clicks but knowing what I'm installing.<br />

            <p>My gaming computer(when it had its original hard drive[I upgraded the hard drive]) would never restart after it would crash(even if it was set to). Once it fully dumps its memory&nbsp;the computer automatically&nbsp;turns off the hard drive. Then it turns back on
 after it restarts. Though if it freezes, just turn it off(wait a while to make sure if its 100% froze)(make sure its done dumping its memory[it shows a percentage, gets done rather quick]).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checking for bad sectors takes a long time, even on a fast computer. If there were any problems it would have fixed them. It reboots after it gets done with error checking automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never had my computers auto update, just to check automatically and have me chose what to install(I always installed the ones that I picked later or right away). The realistic icons is fully optional, and that's smart to always see what your installing
 before you click install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be many things that cause a crash, they can be highly unpredictable. Almost all of the reasons my gaming computer crashed because it was using its memory improperly(even computers mess up too, that's why Microsoft sends out updates to fix these
 kind of issues). Why it was using its memory improperly is unknown to me, but it always recovered like nothing ever happened afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, if it crashes again in the near future there might be a problem. But most likely if you didn't install anything new recently or try any new hardware, it could have just been some kind of fatal error that it prevented. This can happen sometimes,
 sometimes its easy to identify and sometimes its not. But if its the first time this has happened and it doesn't happen again in near future then I wouldn't worry about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does persist, then you should worry. It says the problem at the near the top of the blue screen usually.</p>

            I wish I could've seen if there were any errors, though I'm glad it's working normally ofc. Using its memory improperly :( Sucks cause if that's the case we can't really control that. So far it continues to work as good as always, as if nothing ever happened.
 I keep my fingers crossed!<br />
I was so freaked out I couldn't manage to read much of what it was showing, no to mention I wasn't in front of the laptop when it happened so most likely it was showing the error for some seconds before I could reach it and read it. The only thing I remember
 is it was saying it was going to shut down to prevent damage, some zeros and ones and panic didn't allow me to fix any other words, damn me.<br />

            That's the problem :/ I didn't have it enabled, so it never created that dumpfile. I'd like to know if it could retroactively end up showing what happened days before it being enabled. I doubt it though. Fortunately it didn't happen again but maybe enabling
 mini dumps could help eventually to figure out the reason of any other issues that might occur.

            I don't have any dumpfiles, that's the problem. The issue hasn't repeated though, it didn't happen again. Should I follow Rajesh Govind to enable mini dump files for future references? I'm afraid there's no way to know what caused the shutdown considering
 I don't have those mini dumps enabled. If it happened again (hope not ofc) I could post those files.

            "Safe Mode" is simply Windows running with the bare minimum of programs and support.&nbsp; When you start normally, other programs and services are started that are not started in Safe Mode.&nbsp; Apparently, one of these extra programs is preventing your machine
 from starting normally.&nbsp; The process to discover which program is causing your problem is a hit-and-miss approach and uses the Microsoft&nbsp; "msconfig" utility to selectively enable/disable these extra processes.&nbsp; Once you discover which process is the problem,
 the solution is usually apparent.&nbsp; Refer to the following KB article:<br />

            <p>Dear Karina</p>
<p>Thank you for the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the date and time and region are all correct (and not on auto).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done a soft reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to delete the Outlook app as I am using a Microsoft phone which does not allow this to be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email was working until earlier this week and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you let me know how this can be fixed.</p>
<p><br />

<h3> k&#41;rookie  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB device not recognized in Windows 10</h2>
                    Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; This set-up is totally lean. No sharing. No networking. No syncing. No printer. No television monitor. No phone. The Troubleshooter didn't help. Uninstall/Reinstall countless times didn't help. Update indicates "Most Recent".&nbsp;
 Also unable to&nbsp;Roll-Back. Properties-General message- "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (code 43).&nbsp;Currently this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (code 45)".&nbsp;Properties-Details-message-"Unknown USB Device
 (Device Descriptor Request Failed)" Problem Code 0000002B. I guess the question is:&nbsp; Since no&nbsp;external device will be enabled any time soon, can't we just get eliminate this error message (which we now see in our sleep) even if it means losing an&nbsp;external
 connection plug or is this a Toshiba service problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;Any help will be most appreciated. We'll buy ya lunch.&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; k)rookie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&

<p>Thanks, BUT 1) Not trying to connect anything. Have never tried to connect anything. Don't even own one of those cords that make that connection. 2) Dealing for about a month. 3) No changes. 4) Toshiba Satellite, purchased October 2014. Today is 12/20/15
 at 10:00pm CST. Checking on Updates, which I have set on Auto, the last update was 12/18/15. The unknown USB device screen&nbsp;message has STOPPED! Viewing the Device Manager- USB Composite Device and&nbsp;USB RootHubs-Properties-Details, I see that the Last Arrival
 Date for these&nbsp;is 12/20/15 8:37pm. Is that not an update? When I reopened the Device Manager to see if I was&nbsp;reading it correctly, the error message was once again located there but this time&nbsp;the un-installation was a success. Bottom line- I can't tell you
 how, but no pop-up on the screen&nbsp;so it's all good. (for now)&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run DriverVerifier.<br />
(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the top&nbsp;of the original reply above.)<br />
<br />
Driver Verifier can help find some BSOD issues : <br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a><br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>
