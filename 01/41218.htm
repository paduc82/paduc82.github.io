    <title>dual boot win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            dual boot win 10</h2>
                    <p>I had upgraded my old 32 bit win 10 to a 64 bit win 10 system and while I was transferring my files, I dual booted from the original 32 bit Win 10 system. Now that everything is running smoothly, I would like to remove the old 32 bit partition and included
 the space in my new 64 bit system. However, when I go into the disk management, it is listing the old 32 bit system as 'system,active,primary' partition and is listing my new 64 bit system as (boot, pagefile, crash dump, primary partiton). I am afraid to make
 this partition as active in case I lose all my files. Any suggestion of how to get rid of the 32 bit partition and make the 64 bit system bootable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You will have to backup and perform a clean install. Because Windows 10 32 bit is on the active, boot partition, you won't be able to delete it without it affecting 64 bit Windows on the logical partition.
<br />
<br />You should have performed a custom install of 64 bit Windows 10 over 32 bit Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You could resize the partition for 32 bit Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Boot into Windows 10 64 bit, delete the partition, perform a startup repair, but its potential for problems is quite high.
<br />
<br />Not to mention, its a chore.
<br />
<br />I would backup and just perform a clean wipe.
<br />
<br />
<br />Switching to Windows 10 64 bit is free, you don't have to pay for it. As long as you have a qualifying Windows 7 or 8 or Windows 10 license, you are entitled to use it.
<br />Switching requires that you perform a new installation, that means files, applications and settings will be deleted.
<br />
<br />You will have to reinstall applications and native 64 bit drivers.

<p>Thanks for your insight but my gut tell me that this is not right. There should be a menu somewhere that either boots the 32 bit or the 64 bit system. They should not be connected except through the boot menu. I may be wrong but I am not about to wipe the
 system and start again! They both exisit in seperate partitions, so how are they connected?</p>
<p>There must be a simple way to switch the 'active' system from the 32 bit to the 64 bit and then eliminate the redundant system..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have any advice?</p>

            It can be done as you wish, but it take a little more effort than usual. 
<br />
<br />You will need to boot into Windows 10 64 bit.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Disk Management
<br />
<br />Right click the drive containing your Windows 32 bit installation, then click Delete.
<br />
<br />Right click the drive, then click New volume then format it as NTFS.
<br />
<br />Download&nbsp;Ease us partition manager&nbsp;and resize the drive previously containing your 32 bit Windows 10 installation
<br /><a href="http://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-fre...</a>
<br />
<br />For this example, I will be using Ease us partition manager:
<br />After installing Easeus partition manager, launch the program.
<br />
<br />Select the&nbsp;drive,
<br />Click Resize/Move button on the toolbar
<br />Under Decide size and position, use the&nbsp;slider&nbsp;then drag to the&nbsp;left&nbsp;until a desired amount of space is allocated. Look in the&nbsp;Unallocated Space Before:&nbsp;field to see how much. Once that is done, release.
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Click Apply and OK to confirm changes. Your computer will be restarted to apply the changes.
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 does not boot, get your Windows 10 64 bit install media. 
<br />
<br />Boot from it.
<br />Click Repair computer
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click the option to perform a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Here are some other things you can also do to ensure the system starts booting again:

<p>I tried to delete the 32 bit partition but I get an error that says "Can not delete the active partition on this disk". I have right clicked on the 64 bit partition and there is an option to make this partition the 'active' partition but this is the part
 that concerns me. If it is made 'active', but will not boot into it when restarting, they maybe I would be in trouble. I plan on researching this until the bitter end because I have many, many programs installed and it would be a mess to have to reinstall
 all of them and set them up. Took weeks to get it right the last time and I am not looking forward to doing it again!. :(</p>

            With laptops it is always advisable to upgrade drivers from the mfg's web site. Laptops often<br />
have model specific drivers, and you would want to verify if the mfg has a newer Win8 graphics<br />
driver for your machine.<br />
- Other than that it is debatable if there would be any optimisations for the HD4500 series.
<br />
The best way to find that out would be to read the release notes for any drivers you download.<br />
- You should also check if there are newer Win8 drivers for the other system <br />
components - audio, LAN, etc.<br />
<br />
As you may already be aware, Windows WDDM drivers are the default, or 'generic' graphics
<br />
drivers for Windows and are not the same as the drivers for your graphics card. <br />
The WDDM 1.2 drivers should install automatically with Win8 .<br />
<br />
There is a new AMD driver for WDDM 1.3 (I assume 1.3 will be available via Windows Updates on Win8),<br />
but it is a 'preview' version and best left to those interested in BETA testing, and again,
<br />
possibly not suitable or of benefit for your HD4500.<br />
.<br />

<h2>            Turtle Beach X42 and the Xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, So after tons of research I have come to the conclusion that if I purchase a set of TB X42's they will give me game audio but I won't be able to chat with them. I would have to use the kinect sensor. I get that part. My question is this. If i buy a set
 of TB X42's and then buy the chat adapter for the Xbox One through Microsoft can I then use the mic on the headset for the in game chat and not have to use the Kinect. The main reason that I want to do this is because the new headsets are stereo and not dolby
 digital surround sound ones &nbsp;like my old X41's.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unless another user has specific experience with those headsets, you would probably be better off asking Turtle Beach directly as they would know about their own products. However, if they are sold as Xbox One headsets (I don't know if they are...) then they would presumably work with the Xbox One - both mic and audio.</p>

<p>yeah I like the Astros but It's a bit much for me. I don't game competitively. On Turtlebeache's website they say that they work with the Xbox one but the chat function only works with the kinect. &nbsp;I assume it's because they don't come with a chat adapter
 for the controller. I will call Turtle beach and see if they can tell me more. </p>

            <p>It depends how they connect. If they connect through the controller, they would NEED a chat adapter, but it's possible they connect directly to the console (via optical out?) and so chat would be impossible, meaning you would then need to use Kinect.</p>
<p>Speaking with them should give you a definitive answer though. :)</p>

<p>I have the TB X42 and just purchased the XB1 chat adapter and it's junk. First, my voice breaks up when talking any louder than normal. Second and most importantly the adapter apperantly plays it's own game audio through the headset even with the volume
 turned all the way down on the headset. If you turn down your headset and use the audio from the headset it sounds awful. When using the headset audio ether the adapter audio turned down you can't here your friends in chat. Then when turning up the chat volume
 to fix that issue it plays both audio signals at the same time whitch creats a very bad echo. The X42 is great. Love it. The XB1 adapter? It's garbage.

<p>I own the X42 and it works just fine with my Xbox One Controller with the Stereo Adapter. &nbsp;I can't really tell if I'm getting 5.1 surround. &nbsp;I couldn't tell before when I had the WiFi Adapter connected to the back of my Xbox One. &nbsp;Once you update the controller
 with the Stereo adapter connected all you need to do is connect the headset to the adapter. &nbsp;You don't need the WiFi adapter anymore. &nbsp;I think the WiFi adapter sucked to begin with. &nbsp;Too much whining and crackling. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried this out with my older DX11 wired headset. &nbsp;In my opinion the DX11 works better because I can run it off the system sound, get surround sound that is noticeable. &nbsp;is more comfortable, and it sounds better in chat. &nbsp;Plus I don't need to worry
 about feeding the damn thing batteries. &nbsp; </p>
<p>I do have one unique issue. &nbsp;I have two Xbox One Controllers. &nbsp;I updated both at the same time using the same process. &nbsp;One controller will work with the stereo adapter and the other will not. &nbsp;There is no way to back out the firmware update to try again.
 &nbsp;It is entirely possible that the firmware update is your issue and not the headset.</p>

<p>I wish my pair of X42's would work. I can use them to listen to the game but when I have the chat adapter plugged in and headset plugged in for chat, it shows that I have a mic connected but no one can hear me even though nothing is muted. Usually after
 anywhere from 5-15 minutes my controller randomly disconnects and the only way to reconnect is to remove the chat adapter. I'm starting to think it's the chat cable for my headset but than again it seems to work on my 360 when I reconnect to it.

<p>I have the X41 and the Xbox stereo controller adapter. With the X41 base station connected to the Xbox via optical, I get decent game audio through the headset. I believe it's only stereo and not simulated surround sound. The chat function works with the
 stereo controller adapter, but it has the same problem that everyone else has -- there's a lot of static on my voice which makes it useless for chat. I think that the chat audio coming from these headsets, including the Turtle Beach and Astros, is at a level
 that's causing clipping, which is the cause of the static sound.</p>

<h2>            Hello, HP blue screen</h2>

<div>Firstly the problem started when I deleted accidentally some dmp files,and after this the laptop has some problems for ex. crash problems while I was using internet (Google Chrome), etc; secondly, windows has have lots of self-restart; thirdly I went to
 a laptop engineer and format the windows, but he told me that has had lots of problems with the format, but in the end he's doing the format (Windows 7), he told me that the laptop had problems with hard disc; fourthly, I send my laptop in another engineer
 and he putted a new hard disc sata (250 gb), done the format (windos 7), but some problems are not go away. for ex. crash problems, aw-snap, self-restart. Crash problems and aw-sanp there are for lots of sites in internet like Facebook, etc; I don't know when
 and why self-restart of windows is doing, a blue screen (with some words that I don't know, I have to wait some seconds until the number go at 100 to go restarting) shows in monitor. Some windows that shows in monitor during (or after) the problems.<br />

            <p>Hi Mohamad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that you get an error saying that the feature is unavailable for the Windows edition when trying to add a language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer these questions so I can understand the issue better.<br />
1. Which edition of Windows 8 do you have?<br />
2. How did you install Windows 8?<br />
3. If you upgraded, from which version of Windows did you do so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the Windows edition, type "System" on the Start screen, click "Settings" and click the result that says System. Check for the information under: Windows Edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference to find the Windows version.</p>

<div>I'm so sad reading such answers.</div>
<div>I've purchased my Zenbook with preinstalled Russian OS, but want to switch to English version instead.</div>
<div>I don't need many languages as pro version offers. I want only English Single Language version!!!</div>
<div>Reading the answers that noone can't help such users as Mohamad and me, I become HATING Microsoft with their products and support. I feel like Microsoft just bilked all users across the world!!!</div>
<div>It's so sad...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I assume we need to found some resource and sign the petition to Microsoft to allow the other languages on single language OS.&nbsp;</div>

<div>PEOPLE PLEASE DON'T BUY PRODUCTS WITH PRE-INSTALLED WINDOWS 8!!!!</div>

            A very sad fact indeed. I just wanted my files with Chinese characters to be displayed properly (instead of getting the boxes). It wasn't a problem with Win XP nor Win 7. Now that I'm stuck with this preinstalled Windows 8 Single Language, I very much
 felt cheated by Microsoft.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem. In fact, I have a english windows and i want switch it to french one. I suggest that even if we could not have more than one optional language, at least we would have the choice for choosing the language that we really appreciate
 to be as our single language !! I think that its our right to choose a language that we can properly work with.
</p>
<p>looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>            Permission needed to view photos</h2>
                    I have upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I downloaded&nbsp;photos that now I want to view them using Windows Photos. I can view most of them, but some others I can not. The message I get says: "It looks like you don't have permission to view this file.&nbsp; Check the permissions
 and try again".&nbsp; I'm here for two hours trying everthing but I can not get anywhere.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            <p>Back in August 2016 they were trialing allowing the players from xbox and PC to play together thus from personal experiance my brother who plays pc was in a server at that time with me on xbox ,but now that had been stopped.. My brother was at my house and used my xbox at that time to play on GTA with his character he created on PC but now if he signs on to an Xbox he cannot get his character and progress on trying to go online... So no PC and xbox versions are seperate and we can only wait and see if they ever change and reintoduce our being able to play cross platform with PC again..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Still fails to update. I've run the Windows Update Troubleshooter several times. I tried the links that you suggested. I've shut down my Kaspersky Anti-Virus and run them again. I've downloaded the file separately and tried to get it to load. Still after
 all this, just a few minutes after I've re-booted I get a message that a restart is required. This has been going on for almost a year now and I'm at my wits end.</p>
<p>I thank you very much for your help. You did offer a few things I had not tried but I am still having the same issue. Any other ideas are always welcome.</p>

<p>I'm still in the same boat. That pc constantly restarts and blocks my bandwith and performance with downloading and preparing installations of KBXYZ. Sometimes it manages to install an KB after some weeks but then the next one fails for some more weeks and
 the uninstalled KBs pile up...<br />
I tried everything i read online so far but nothing worked... If it wasn't my work pc i'd trow it out the window(or make an clean install)...</p>

<p>
</p><p>It keeps trying to download and install and uses my bandwidth which paralyzes my computer. I use this machine to game and every time it does this I get a 999 ping and can't use anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Windows Update Troubleshooter which is a temporary fix but the issue returns daily and sometimes multiple times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded this update manually from the Microsoft Update Library but it will not install. It keeps trying and then tells me that it didn't install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the only update that seems to be having issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the following error : </p>
<p>
</p><p>• Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 - Error 0x80072af9</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the Windows 10 version 1703 is doing the same thing. </p>

                    <p>The latest update from Windows 8 has caused my laptop to freeze on the start screen.I get no response from any of the tiles.</p>
<p>I can exit the start screen by using the old standby of cntrl / alt /del, and ask to sign out.</p>
<p>The screen then says:</p>
<p>Closing 1 app and signing out</p>
<p>Task Host Window</p>
<p>Task Host is stopping background tasks (\Microsoft\Windows\WS\Badge Update)</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get this working again ?</p>

            <p><span>Hi SteveFramingham,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install windows updates and the updates frozen.</span></p>
<p><span>Before starting the troubleshooting steps, I need the required information.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur only with the particular update?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer
 in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on settings, more pc settings and then general.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down to advanced startup, click restart now.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on troubleshoot, advanced options, Windows Startup Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click restart, select safe mode and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<b>Method 2:</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a clean boot to check if any third party
 application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the
 option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click
 ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
 right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem,
 the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program
 manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the link for Troubleshoot problems with installing updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshoot problems with installing updates</span></p>

            I had the same problem with the last update of windows. But mine frozen when I restarted my laptop, because the internet was just not working (working 5 min before, after DOING NOTHING stopped working and it wasn't my wifi because both my iphone and ipad
 was working). So I decide to restarted and boom, frozen in the start screen. After I restarted (again) it began to work, but still its slow. I checked for viruses, but the CPU, RAM and Hard Drive use its at minimal, so I guess nothing viral its happening.
<div>I really think that the problem its the update.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>It turned out that the update rendered my laptop totally useless, and after 3 hours on the phone with Microsoft, Windows 8 was removed, and I am now back on W7.</p>
<p>I will try again after Xmas, hoping that Microsoft have sorted the update issues out.</p>

I can confiirm exactly this- badge update process is locking the screen up. The desktop works for a while, but Windows is currently usleless. Couldn't have happened at a worst time!

            <div>I manually accepted and installed all windows updates available today, &nbsp;December 12, 2012 .</div>
The update completed and re-booted and returned to an unresponsive start screen. Sometimes, if I keep trying I can get the Charms bar to show, but no response from any tile / button. I tried waiting, and re-booting.
<div>I did manage, after a number of attempts, to alt-tab to the desktop, and provided I stay on desktop / desktop apps, I can carry on working. If I go back to the start screen it is hit-or-miss if I can alt-tab back to the desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please can we have a fix to get the start screen working again?</div>

            <p>that did not work, it hung during the operation I re-booted after about 45 minutes of it suceeding (completing the restore) it was on a blue screen with the circle "circling away" so I intervined and powered down. The tiles that I installed previously are
 now showing installing... and all are unresponsive.</p>
<p>I logged on as domain admin which I was able to do the the stytem restore was greyed out and not available. I tried the alt-tab as suggest below it didn't really work at all (it did something but I didn't recognize what action was being performed). Still
 can not boot to safe mode.</p>

 Ya he intentado reembolsar las compras pero la pagina microsoft no mme ayuda porque siempre me manda al mismo enlace que no me sirve para nada y no me salen las opciones de contactar con los de soporte tecnico. Hay alguna de recuperar el dinero sin tener que

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As AutoCAD 2014 is supported for Windows 8.1 or previous operating system. I suggest you to install AutoCAD 2014 in compatibility mode and check.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refer the link: </strong><a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-AutoCAD-2014.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-AutoCAD-2014.html</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Compatibility Mode.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Skype, newest version</h2>
                    I would like to have Skype 740.1.102 or 3 - I have a new computer with Windows 10 and the version of skype on it is the new one which I hate.&nbsp; In the work I do the older version was what we were using.&nbsp; I uninstalled the version associated with this computer
 and thought I had downloaded the older version but now I still have the new version with no place to find Tools or anything.&nbsp; There are no icons to do this on the left hand side.

    <title>Multiple Screen Wallpaper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandondonaldson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Screen Wallpaper</h2>
                    So I have my laptop hooked up to a second monitor with the display extended and I have my personalize settings set up to make my wallpaper cycle through a series of pictures in a folder. &nbsp;But the two screens always have different wallpapers and I can't
 find a way to make each screen have the same wallpaper at the same time. The shuffle feature is not on and if I right click on the desktop to hit "next wallpaper" it will change one and then the other so that I can't get them to match up. &nbsp;Is this possible
 on Windows 8 and if so, how?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that you need the same wallpaper on your dual screen windows 8 computer.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to perform the following steps to get the same wallpaper on your Windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. For extending the wallpaper, across both your monitors, you will need an image with the right dimensions that can span across both your screens, or it will appear pixelated or stretched.<br />
2. Once you have the image you want as your extended wallpaper, right-click the Desktop and click ‘Customize’.<br />
3. From the themes, select ‘Windows Extended’ under Aero Themes,<br />
4. Once you have the theme selected, you can then select your extended wallpaper.<br />
5. Click ‘Desktop Background’ to bring up the wallpaper customization interface. From there, browse to the location where you saved your extended wallpaper if it isn’t already being displayed there.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Choose the wall paper he wants to set as background and then get it extended</span></p>
<p><span><br />
7. Right-click the wallpaper of your choice and from the menu, select ‘Set for all monitors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            What the question involves is not the stretching of the wallpaper to two screens but syncing the pictures that appear so that the two screens match.&nbsp; In previous versions this was the way the display worked.&nbsp; Two different pictures at the same time is
 not visually pleasing to me.

            I have exactly the same problem. It is as if my skype name and outlook account have splintered into two accounts both having parts of my information (profile details, contacts etc.) but not all. I have had the account for over 15 years.

<h2>            Switch from Ubuntu 14.04 to Windows 7 using a bootable win 7 usb</h2>
                    <p>I am using Ubuntu 14.04 on a HP Envy Touchsmart i5, however, I want to switch to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bootable windows 7 usb drive. I have changed the boot sequence in the BIOS so it runs the usb first but unfortunately it is able to pass on to the Ubuntu OS. I have also tried openinig the executable setup file using 'wine' from the usb and I obtain
 this error after clicking 'Install Windows 7':</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Error:</em></p>
<p><em>'Windows cannot find a location to store temporary installation files. To install windows, make sure a partition on your boot disk has at least 699mb of free space.&nbsp; Error Code: 0x80070490'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 200GB of disk space. I believe I may have to use 'gparted partition editor' but I am not familiar with it either.</p>

            Have the same issue, unfortunately my laptop is stuck ay boot, boots in safe mode and then gets the same error as you did. Usually, my boot stuck would get fixed with a System Restore. Unfortunately it got broken really bad right now.

<h2>            Mouse lag after creators fall update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a problem with the mouse after my Asus desktop installed the Creators Fall update. Now, my mouse pointer stops where it is every 2 seconds and then carries on after a half second. I've timed it for two minutes and it seems every 2 seconds it stops.
 A small thing but so annoying! I've tried a reset, starting in safe mode, reinstalling Asus drivers, reinstalling the mouse drivers, nothing works. What is Windows doing every 2 seconds??</p>

<p>Hi. Have now tried a Microsoft wired mouse and there's no difference at all. It still holds it's position momentarily every two seconds. My PC is an Asus all in one. It has an AMD A6 6310 APU with AMD Radeon R4 graphics, 6GB RAM and on Windows 10 and Creators
 Fall update installed.</p>
<p>Appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction. I've checked the mouse settings but can't see anything obvious there</p>

<p>Unfortunately no help for me.&nbsp; My Bluetooth Surface Arc Mouse experiences this issue, but wired mouse or the Surface Type Cover's built-in touchpad are fine.&nbsp; I'm using a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue is that while moving the pointer, it will freeze and stick in place, frozen for about a full two seconds, then unstick and jump to the new location (depending on how much you moved the mouse during those 2 seconds, it might jump a long distance).&nbsp;
 This repeats every few seconds, making the mouse nearly impossible to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've been reporting this during the development/insider builds in the feedback app and I know other pros (not to namedrop, but Rich Hay has the same issue) with the same problem.&nbsp; But I'm not using an insider build on this computer, this is the 1709 final
 release.</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for the reply. I tried the troubleshooter but it found no problems. I opened the mouse settings box and tried what you suggested but that made no difference either. However, I seem to have stopped it happening. I tried changing a few settings
 to see if anything helped.</p>
<p>I checked the box for pointer trails but put the pointer trail speed to short so that you don't see a trail and now the mouse doesn't stop anymore.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this will affect anything else but seems to have worked.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help people and Happy Christmas!</p>
<p>Dave</p>
