<h2>            Cannot access UEFI firmware setting in Advanced options &#40;Troubleshoot&#41; in Windows 10</h2>
                    I use Acer spin 7 (64 bit) system with windows 10 and currently trying to dual boot my system with Ubuntu 16. As Windows 10 was installed in UEFI mode so I know that I need to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode as well. I am also aware that in order to that,
 firstly I need to disable quick boot/fast boot&nbsp;and then secure boot. However, I am having an issue in disabling secure boot. I followed &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.appgeeker.com/recovery/disable-uefi-secure-boot-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.appgeeker.com/</a>"
 target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article to disable secure boot but I could not access&nbsp;Advanced options in Troubleshoot menu. After I click advanced options, my system will restart instead of showing the Advanced options.&nbsp;<br />
I am stuck here so can anyone help me, please?&nbsp;

<br />How to Disable UEFI Secure Boot in Windows 10

<br />
<br />Part 2: Disable "Secure Boot"
<br />
<br />Once you're on the UEFI utility screen, move to Boot tab on the top menu. Use the arrow key to go to Secure Boot option and then Use + or – to change its value to Disable.
<br />
<br />Note: Depending on the motherboard's BIOS/ UEFI firmware, the Secure Boot option will be found on the "Boot", "Security", or "Authentication" tab.

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />To access UEFI Settings, Press F2 repeatedly after you press the power button. Then, see an option similar to "clear all keys" and you should see Secure boot option being enabled.

            <p>Sounds like a leftover from a Windows Update session.&nbsp; Try restarting the computer first, if that doesn't let you delete it you should proceed with caution unless you are sure it's unneeded.&nbsp; You may need to take ownership of the folder and delete it.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail has deleted some of my folders. Is there anything I can do to recover them&#63;</h2>
                    I use Windows Live Mail (WLM) to backup my Hotmail folders and messages. On 11 Jan 2013 I was deleting some (nearly) duplicate folders in WLM, first moving any messages from the about-to-be-deleted folder to the remaining folder, so that all current Hotmail
 and WLM folders had identical names. I did not delete any Hotmail folders or rename them. What I soon discovered was that 5 important folders (with all messages) had been deleted from Hotmail (and none were in the Deleted folder). I had not accidentally (or
 purposefully) deleted these folders in Hotmail or in WLM. I had only deleted folders in WLM which no longer existed in Hotmail. Is there any answer to this mystery? Even better, is there anyone at Hotmail who can recovered them for me?<br />

<p>I did not actually delete any Hotmail folders ...<br />
</p>
<p>[Is] there&nbsp;... any way in which deleting a folder in WLM could also delete it in Hotmail
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
The whole point of the DeltaSync protocol that you're using to access your Hotmail account in Windows Live Mail is to ensure that as far as possible the account folders and their contents are identical on both client and server. If you delete a message or a
 folder in WLMail, it will be deleted in Hotmail at the next sync. This seems to be what happened in your case.<br />
<br />
Using DeltaSync, you <em>can</em> save messages locally while not keeping them on the server, by moving them out of an account folder and in to a folder under Storage folders. You
<em>can't</em> save messages on the server but delete them locally, e.g. to save space on your disk drive.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>[Is]&nbsp;there&nbsp;... an easy way for me to import the messages (from WLM) to the 'missing' Hotmail folders
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
All you have to do is re-create the folders in WLMail and populate them. At the next sync, they should be restored to Hotmail. It may not all happen in one go if there are a lot of&nbsp;messages involved, so don't be impatient.</p>

            Hello keithperth,<br />
<br />
When you go into User Accounts, is your account listed as an Administrator or a Standard user account.<br />
If you are an Administrator, then create a new administrator account, log on with that new account and see if you can access the folder.
<br />
<br />
If your account is no longer an administrator you will not be able to create a new admin account. However, there is a hidden Administrator account that<br />
is disabled by default. You can enable it and then do the testing from above.<br />
<br />
To enable the hidden built in Administrator account, check out the following URL:<br />

<br />
Please reply back and let us know the results of your testing and if your issue is resolved. If you still need further assistance, we will be glad to help.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />

            <p>I FOUND THE SOLUTION! Anyone else having this issue and feeling the way I did should do this upon loading into a 360 game:</p><p>1. Open the old dash by holding the line and square buttons (originally the start and back buttons)</p><p>2. Select Manage Storage and select Yes on the warning screen</p><p>3. Select Saved Games and bingo, all the stupid cloud saves are just sitting there vulnerable to your deletion</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Ram shows only 3.20 usable, Bios correctly shows 8GB. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Today I installed 4GB RAM (I had 4GB already) to my laptop for some extra performance. However Windows only shows 3.20 GB usable instead of 8.0GB. I checked in BIOS is shows 8GB.</p>
<p>I used cpu-z, it correctly detected RAM on both slot, but it shows 800Mhz instead of 1600Mhz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 64bit on Lenovo G505s. Can anybody advise me to correct this problem?!</p>
<p>Many Thanks!</p>

<p>Je viens de vérifier de mon côté, il ne semble pas avoir de toune manquante, celles achèté ou les transfers de licence des autres rock band semblent être tjs là pour moi, vérifiez du coté de votre DD si elles s y trouvent tjs, sinon vous pouvez également
 retourner sur le marché XBL voir si vous pouvez retélécharger sans frais des chansons que vous aviez déjà achetées. J aimerais que vous développer sur le LOUÉ, l avez-vous lu qque part ou est ce juste une supposition de votre part</p>

<p>Désolé pour avoir pêté un câble mais c'était mérité, je sais pas quand tu as téléchargé tes musiques ShapelHeresy, mais moi ça date et apparament comme tu m'as suggéré de retélécharger mes musiques... ben du coup... tout ce qui est d'Oasis est indisponible
 pour le moment sur le marché rockband et un paquet de musiques sont à retélécharger pour les mises à jour&nbsp;ce qui est...selon moi génial, et je suis sérieux!!! Mais là par-contre, c'est à MOI et MOI seul de me souvenir ce que j'avais avant tout ça.</p>
<p>C'est pas genre: " Une nouvelle mise à jour est disponible pour cette (ou certaines de vos chansons déjà téléchargées) chanson désirez-vous une mise à jour? .... ben même pas ... :( C'est carrément démerdez vous et merci bonsoir :S rappelez vous de ce que

<p>Mes premieres chasons RB date de la sortie de RB2, Tu peux aller consulter la liste de tous tes téléchargement en passant par ta console, mais je te conseil plutot d'y aller par ce site, tu vas ds "MON Compte" en haut à droite, ensuite ds la colonne "Historique
 des boutiques Xbox" et click sur historique des achats. Tu devrais trouver a cette endroit la liste complete des download depuis l ouverture de ton compte XBL avec la date d'achat et l option pour remettre l'item ds la files d attente de tes téléchargements.
</p>
<p>PS: Je ne t en veux pas pour ton pétage de coche c normal car se faire fourrer c pas le fun si on est pas en train de parler de sexe</p>
<p>De plus après réflexion, je me suis souvenu que lorsque j ai tranféré RB2 vres RB3 certaine chanson comme Batterie de Metalicca n'ont pas suivi faute d une attente commercial entre Harmonix et le distributeur du groupe.
</p>
<p>PPS: Malheureusement un coup de téléphone a Xbox ne vas surment rien donner, car encore un fois a mon souvenir lors de l'achat du bunddle instrument/jeux le vendeur m avait dit Harmonix était les seul a s occuper du service apres vente pour la garantie et
 les problème</p>

                    <p>Original title: Duplicate files</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a hard drive failure requiring its replacement. The people who installed the new drive were able to transfer files from the old to the new drive. However, somehow I seem to have many files duplicated, including hundreds of saved pictures. I am reluctant
 to delete any folder containing these files without verifying the folders/files are truly identical. Is there a way to compare the files/folders that appear to be duplicated?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;posting your query on Microsoft&nbsp;Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may compare the date in which they are modified and&nbsp;verify if the file is a duplicate or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;the <strong>File Explorer</strong> icon on the Taskbar.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>View </strong>tab and select <strong>Sort by</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Now,&nbsp;select <strong>Date Modified</strong>.</p>
<p>4. You may now compare your folders and check. If they have the same date and time then they probably are duplicates.</p>
<p>5. You may select the duplicate and press <strong>Delete</strong> from your keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <p>Be aware that windows 10 duplicates listing of files in Windows Explorer--in Libraries, One Drive--depending on your settings, other folders. Some listings are just shortcuts to files actual location, not true duplicates. The actual files are under Users/Your
 Name. Experiment with deleting a file you have elsewhere--like an external drive. You should have copies of pictures and other personal files stored off the computer anyway--copies not just backups. An external hard drive is essential. You can move the folders
 to an ext drive instead of deleting to see what is left on the actual hard drive.</p>

            <p>Thank you. No, the issue is not resolved. I am still unable to compare large files of pictures that appear to be duplicated. To find duplicates by manually comparing the contents of each file with hundred of pictures would take days. My desire is to free
 up disc space by eliminating the duplicates. I would appreciate your help as the previous response I received did not work; some of the options I was to use were inactive (grayed out).</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Don</p>

<h2>            Game Controller Vibration function not working Windows 8</h2>
                    I recently bought a controller (Enter - E GPV). I downloaded the driver and installed it, and then when I open the﻿ ''Setup USB Game Controller'', select USB Vibration Joystick and click the Vibration tab it just closes and says "Windows Shell Common Dll
 has stopped working"
<div>&nbsp;*I have Windows 8 Pro with Media Center*!&nbsp;</div>
<div>Other than this the controller works fine!
<div>My vibration used to work fine on Windows 7! <br />
Please help!</div>

    <title>Arc Touch Mouse for Surface click issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bohmfalk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Arc Touch Mouse for Surface click issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the arc touch mouse on the Surface Pro 2, and other than easily fixable connectivity issues, I haven't had any problems with it until recently (past couple of weeks).&nbsp; The problem is that when I'm using the mouse, it continually double clicks when
 I try to single click with the mouse.&nbsp; Nothing happened to the mouse to make it suddenly start working this way as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Sometimes when I click with the mouse it works fine, sometimes it doesn't.&nbsp; But I have a hard time (more often than not)
 highlighting anything as the mouse is clicking on and off as I'm trying to drag it, and when I open or close new tabs on my browser it often opens two tabs at once or tries to close several tabs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going into settings and changing how sensitive the double click is (slower/faster fade mechanism) and that hasn't helped.&nbsp; And the arc mouse app is almost completely useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<h2>            RDP Printer Redirection Stops Working After Windows 10 Feature Update 1803</h2>
                    <p>I have a client, who daily uses the Windows Remote Desktop&nbsp;Connection app to connect his Windows 10 Pro desktop&nbsp;from home to&nbsp;his Windows 10 Pro desktop at his office.&nbsp; His&nbsp;local home printers automatically&nbsp;redirect, so he can print a document on the office
 PC back to his printers at home.&nbsp; He has been doing this for at least six months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then he installed the Windows 10 Feature Update 1803 on both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, the Remote Desktop Connection app connected from home-to-office, but there are no redirected printers.&nbsp; The Printers box (and Clipboard box) on the Local Resources tab is checked, but no printers redirect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have a clue how this situation can be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice!</p>

            Hello, <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry about the delays. The error 0x80070643 given when installing KB4052623 is could be caused by a running antivirus in background. Try to
<strong>disable your antivirus for the meantime</strong>, and install the update. That help the KB installation proceed correctly. If you're using Windows Defender as your trusted protection software, it is still advised to treat it the same. Be mindful to
 enable your antivirus after doing the activity successfully. <br />
<br />
<br />
If this would not work, please perform these two commands in order:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><span><span>Go to
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 and in the search box, enter </span></span><span><span><strong>Command Prompt</strong></span></span><span><span>. Press and hold (or
 right-click)&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Command Prompt (Desktop app)</span></span><span><span>from the search results and select
</span></span><span><span><strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Enter
</span></span><span><span><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</em></span></span><span><span>(note the spaces before
 each "/").</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Enter
</span></span><span><span><em>sfc</em></span></span><em><span><span>/scannow</span></span></em><span><span>(note
 the space between "sfc" and "/")</span></span></li></ol>
<br />
<br />
Please comeback to us, with the return-messages of the commands. <br />

Best regards. <br />

<p>My win 10 OS needed to be updated to the latest version because of the hacking into my computer that i was experiencing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old WIN 10 OS was version 1607 and Microsoft advised me to update to 1709.</p>
<p>I Tried to do so myself but did not succeed.</p>
<p>I contact Microsoft and they tell me to call there offices for help.</p>
<p>That i did and one of there technicians took over my computer for 15 minutes and removed or fixed whatever it was preventing my machine from updating.</p>
<p>My computer updated and is now working just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest thanks for your assistance and concern. much appreciated ,&nbsp; john&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot change log-in screen backgound in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kanbunuechi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot change log-in screen backgound in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom photo as my lock screen background.&nbsp; I've found instructions that indicate that the lock screen background can also be set as the log-in screen background by going to settings-personalization-lock screen and then page down and there is an
 option to set the log-in screen to the lock screen background.&nbsp; However, I have no such option in my personalization-lock screen settings.&nbsp; My only option is to either turn on or turn off "show Windows background picture on sign-on screen".&nbsp; There is no option
 for anything other than to either turn on or off the Windows background picture - no option to set the log-in (sign-in) screen to any other image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been unable to find any solution to this issue.&nbsp; Any suggestions are much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            That would be great if I had that option.&nbsp; See my original post.&nbsp; I DO NOT have the option to "Show lock screen background picture on the sign-on screen".&nbsp; My only option is "Show Windows background picture on the sign-on screen" - "on" or "off".&nbsp; My system
 does not allow me to show anything picture on the sign-in screen except the Windows background picture.&nbsp; If I turn that off, I can have a blank screen with color, and can change the color, but that's it.<br />

            <p>I restarted my desktop to go to my Release Preview Build 14393.726 to see if the Settings/Personalization/Lock screen were the same as the Fast Ring build15025.1000 that I'm using while replying to you and they are both the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if when you are in settings and your cursor is on the right side of the settings screen and you scroll down and never see what is on the snip image I posted earlier there must be something wrong with your install and might need to reinstall to repair
 it.</p>

            If the OP is not an insider, he will need to update to the version 1607&nbsp; public build 14393. That should have been available to download and install from last August.

<p>Need for Speed Rivals on the Xbox 360 requires an Xbox 360 Hard Drive with 3GB of storage space for a mandatory installation of game disc content. &nbsp;you will be prompted to perform this installation the first time time you boot up your game.</p>
<p>You cannot play your game without this installation, nor can it be installed on flash memory sticks, or internal flash memory--such as the internal memory of the Xbox 360 Slim, or 4GB model. Hard Drives are available and sold separately for the Xbox 360
 Slim/4GB, Arcade, and Core consoles.</p>

<p>What he said ^^^</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the newer games now which are available on next-gen too require an install of some kind on the 360 too. If you only have a basic model console with low memory, I would recommend being very careful what you buy in future as this will
 be the case for many new release games. There should be a message on the case if it does require an install.</p>
<p>Adding to the bad news, the Official Hard Drives don't come cheap either...</p>

<h2>            disc read error&#63;</h2>
                    It's only happening with two discs. And it just happens to be both grand theft auto V discs. I have an Xbox 360 original. I have all the latest updates. I have GTA V. Sometimes I can play it and other times my Xbox won't read it. I have it installed to
 my HDD as its supposed to be. But just to see if there was install errors, I erased the install. So now I'm trying to use the first cd to install gta again. My Xbox says "play game" Instead of saying play gta v And having a thumbnail of the game. So I click
 play game. Then it says "the disc is unreadable" I don't understand how it's unreadable. When I bought the game I put the first disc in my Xbox and installed it. And then I put it back in the case and never touched it again. It's definitely not broken. Also,
 instead of saying play gta V when I put the second disc in, it also says play game. Both discs are clean. Yet my Xbox thinks they're not. When I put either disc in, I can click X and it brings me the game details of grand theft aut

<p>UPDATE: </p>
<p>Both GTA V discs won't read. </p>
<p>Assassins creed (the first one) &nbsp;Will read. </p>
<p>When I put assassins creed in, it doesn't say "play game" like GTA is doing. It actually says play assassins creed.
</p>
<p>I tried playing Battlefield 3. </p>
<p>It said "play game" instead of saying play battlefield 3. </p>
<p>But when I launched it it still played. </p>
<p>I tried playing guitar hero warriors of rock. </p>
<p>Instead of saying "play game" it says play GH warriors of rock</p>
<p>And it plays fine. </p>
<p>I tried playing Black Ops 1. </p>
<p>It said play game instead of play black ops. </p>
<p>It also says disc read error. </p>
<p>That disc is dirty but I've played it numerous times so I would think it still works.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well it sounds as if it's the beginning to end of your disc drive. I had one once that played everything except</p>
<p>Gears of War. I tried to play 4 brand new copies and none of them would play yet I had no trouble with any other game. Not to long after the drive quit all together. I would suggest if at all possible trying the game on a different console before making
 a decision to repair or replace your console.</p>
<p>If you do need a repair you can start that process here.</p>
