<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">However due to drivers being on the machine I can no longer access the internet using WIFI. The ethernet port

            <p>Hi Connor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you clean install Windows on your computer, it wipes off all drivers and only reinstalls those that come with the operating system. Before we can help you connect the computer to the WiFi, please answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you have to install a WiFi adapter on the computer before to be able to connect it to wireless networks?</li><li>How did you clean install Windows 7 on the computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Desktops do not usually come with built-in WiFi. If you had to install a WiFi adapter to enable wireless connection on your PC, you may need to do the same thing to be able to connect it again. If you're unsure whether you had to add the adapter yourself,
 you can take a look at the BIOS. Should you need assistance in doing so, please get in touch with the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also help if you run the Network Adapter troubleshooter available in Control Panel. It will give you more details about the missing devices on your computer necessary for connecting to the Internet. Follow these steps to run the suggested tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Set the view to <strong>Small icons</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>On the left panel, click on <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Network Adapter</strong> and allow the troubleshooter to run.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Entering something like <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">
xw4600s results in "too many matches" do you might need to use something more specific like your product serial number then find the download section, look for drivers/wireless/Wi-Fi and download away.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">It does look like some Broadcom device and you should not be downloading driver from any of those free driver scan sites...&nbsp; stick with the drivers HP recommends.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">If you can't figure it out post back the serial number of your unit and we can help look.</span></p>

            <p>No. The PC was pre-owned so I didn't have to install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a custom install so it would wipe out everything. Also deleted windows.old before I realised I didn't have internet.</p>

            <p>No serial number, huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manger do you see the Wi-Fi device listed with yellow question marks or exclamations - maybe in Other Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find the device, right click, Properties, Details ad look at the Hardware Ids:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc5d7bb2-6e46-4bb0-976e-88d22f82f141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc5d7bb2-6e46-4bb0-976e-88d22f82f141" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know the VENdor and DEVice you can look what you need with a Google search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that example the VENdor is 10DE and the DEVice is 03EF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can post a screenshot using the instructions in this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">How to include a screenshot in your post</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You really don't have a Windows 7 problem and there is nothing Windows can do about your hardware not having a driver - you have an HP hardware problem so you might get some better ideas in the HP Support forums where their experts hang out and that would
 be here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, the specifications for HP xw4600 Workstation do not include a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; Perhaps the "s" at the end of your model designation added that feature or perhaps the previous owner added one to the unit you bought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See:</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you look at the back of your computer, is there an antenna?&nbsp; Or is there a cable connected to an antenna?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might consider opening the case and inspecting the add-on cards to determine if there is a wireless network adapter and if so, its make and model number.</p>

            <p>Nope there is nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already opened it up as I had a bad memory stick before. There is no wireless adapter so I'm extreamly confused at what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is from an old grpahics design bussiness so it has been altered. I believe you might be right about the "s" being the reason why I can't find drivers.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure that looking up the system by serial number on HP would help with the specs but since we still don't have that it we can't do that anyway,</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we don't have a screen shot of Device Manager with Network adapters expanded yet either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if there is no wireless adapter in Device Manger and if there is no wireless card installed and if you are positive you had Wi-Fi before could the wireless be provided by something that gets plugged into a USB port - either directly or cabled like either
 on of these:</p>

<p>The choice is yours, but especially on a tower computer, I suggest an adapter with an external antenna rather than one of the "micro" or "nano" adapters.&nbsp; An adapter with a cable between the connector and the antenna is even better, so that the antenna isn't
 stuck between the back of the case and the wall of your room.&nbsp; For example: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166056&amp;cm_re=wifi_wireless_adapter-_-33-166-056-_-Product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />Power down

<br />Open the system unit

<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds

<br />If it doesn't work, its an issue with Windows 10 not recognizing the drive it seems. You have since confirmed it works in Ubuntu. 
<br />
<br />If the BIOS reset does not work, please file a bug report and send me the short link so I can upvote it:

            If you don't want to make the change, exit the BIOS without making changes.

<br />Yes, please send the short link.

            Hi Dale, 
<br />
<br />The first thing to do is test the battery
<br />Shut down your laptop
<br />On the Dell Logo, repeatedly press F12
<br />From the Temporary boot menu, choose Diagnostics
<br />Run the short form of the DIagnostics
<br />That will inform you of your batteries health
<br />
<br />If your battery health is OK
<br />Open Device manager and Expand the Batteries Section
<br />Right click 'Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery' and click uninstall 
<br />Shut down your laptop
<br />Remove the Battery and unplug the power lead
<br />Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds
<br />Re-insert the battery
<br />Re-connect the power lead
<br />
<br />Start your laptop
<br />
<br />This is a long known and ongoing bug in Windows 10, I hope the above works for you . . .       
        </p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point - Start type in --&gt; Restore                find at top - Create
<br />
<br />Right Clcik Start - Device Manager - Batteries - Double Click each item one at a time - Driver tab - Update driver - when complete OK - go back and right click on and Uninstall - OK. When you have done both restart the computer.
<br /> 
<br />Remove ALL power and remove battery - clean the terminals if possible with a pencil eraser (some you can some you can't).
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />The battery could be worn - Use this method to check the battery and create a report : 
<br />
<br />WinKEY +X - or Right Click in the lower left corner - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR Windows PowerShell
<br />
<br />Copy/paste or type : 
<br />
<br />powercfg -energy -output %userprofile%\desktop\energy-report.html
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />That creates "energy-report.html" and puts it on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />double click the file on your desktop 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Battery Information :
<br />
<br />Design Capacity
<br />
<br />Last Full Charge
<br />
<br />Copy and paste those into a reply here so we can interpret them for you.
<br />
<br /> --------------
<br />
<br />Also in a Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell - navigate to a folder where you have Write rights such as     \YourUserName\Documents
<br />
<br />Type or Copy and Paste each of these and press enter after each : (if C: is where your Documents folder is)
<br />
<br />C:
<br />
<br />CD\
<br />
<br />CD %userprofile%\Documents
<br />
<br />powercfg /BATTERYREPORT
<br />
<br />That puts Battery-Report.html in your Documents folder.
<br />
<br />====
<br />
<br />Check with the system maker's support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Many have software that will control the battery charge which is designed to extend the battery life. Right Click the battery icon near the clock and see if there are any selections there to set - of course, the software controls could be anywhere on the system - such as App/Start menu, Start Settings. Control Panel, Device Manager, or other locations.
<br />
<br />Check with the Dell Support,  their on-line documentation, drivers/firmware, diagnostics, and ask in their forums for known issues. Dell will have methods for checking batteries.

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

    <title>Screen freezes with the spinning not responding circle after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scarletmummy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen freezes with the spinning not responding circle after reboot</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 recently - all ok at first but now I am lucky if I get 10 minutes of use before the spinning circle arrives &amp; I am told that things are 'not responding'. I have to force the laptop to close &amp; start up again to get another few minutes
 of use. This is obviously useless &amp; very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought it was hotmail on the go slow, but it happens when when using Word too and I have had to abandon important documents to their fate. Please help!<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Scarlet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we can proceed further, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes in terms of updates or software prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. When you get the "not responding" error does it usually occur when you use a specific program/software/tool?</p>
<p>3. Do you have enough free space in your C: drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you&nbsp;open <strong>Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) </strong>
and under the <strong>performance</strong> tab check if&nbsp;there are any specific program or software which might be altering the performance of the PC.&nbsp;Also in the same window check if you have multiple apps/program that might be activated after reboot. This
 you will find under the<strong> Startup&nbsp;</strong>tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try running the System Maintenance and check if it help with the lagging PC.
<span><span>The <strong>Run maintenance task</strong> checks issues that might slow down your computer's performance, such as how many users are currently logged on to the computer and whether multiple programs
 are running at the same time.</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>Run maintenance task</strong> under
<strong>System and Security</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Hope this helps</span></p>
&nbsp;

<li>No - I've tried to avoid messing with anything at all as I can't afford not to have daily access to the internet. I do have a tablet, which is what I used to post my original message, but I can't carry out
 all my business on that.</li><li>I've tried to monitor that, but as I am usually using my hotmail 'live' account with the One Drive and Word to update documents I have not narrowed it further. I have a suspicion that it's perhaps after I've
 opened a Word document and done some editing, but I&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>it's also happened when I've just been e-mailing and on the Internet.</li><li>I believe I do, I have tried to keep this laptop as free as I can, moving photos to an external drive regularly etc.., but I should perhaps check - how much do I need to stop this happening?</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>I have had several looks at Task Manager and can't see anything consuming lots of space at the time of the problems. I DO, however, get a message every time I start up that says 'Fast Start Windows does not support this application'
 and I periodically get a message telling me that the Smart ReBooter, or something similar, is not working.............is this a clue?</div>

            <p>Hi Scarlet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the added information,&nbsp;I would appreciate if you can shine more light into the issue.</p>
<p>1. What is these "things"&nbsp;you have referred to when you stated "I am told that things are not responding"?</p>
<p>2. Have you ran the tool provided in the above mentioned post?</p>
<p>3. If yes, what was its outcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with,&nbsp;I do not think that the above mentioned programs have any role with your PC&nbsp;freezing. Having stated so, I suggest that you perform Disk Cleanup and check if it helps. To learn how to do so click on the link below</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also navigate to <strong>Control Panel &gt;Programs and Features</strong>, locate the two programs that are not working and not supported by the PC and then uninstall the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Kyleigh, hope this message finds you well.
<br />
<br />When you receive contact requests with the said type of numbers, don’t worry because it is a Skype username. It means that the account was created using a phone number.

<p>Hi Mary,<br />
<br />
You might encounter that error message when playing video files for one of the following reasons:<br />
<br />
• The file type is supported by the Player, but the file was compressed by using a codec that is not supported by the Player.<br />
• The file might have been encoded by using a codec that is not supported by Windows Media Player. If this is the case, Windows Media Player cannot play the file.<br />
<br />
Windows media player will only play the files and videos only if it supports that file type. Please refer the below article that gives you Information about the Multimedia file types that Windows Media Player supports.<br />
<br />
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/316992/file-types-supported-by-windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File types supported by Windows Media Player</a></strong></em><br />
<br />
If the files are not supported by Windows media player then you need to use some third-party player which supports that file format.<br />
</p>
<p>Take note that using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved.
 Using Third Party Software is at your own risk. <br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help. </p>

<h2>            How to unlink Microsoft account from local account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I logged in to the Windows Store, just to find out that for some reason, my local administrator account is suddenly being converted into a Microsoft account. This was never my attention, and the fact that the password settings of the Microsoft account
 have now overwritten the local settings is extremely unpleasant to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spend hours searching already, and found many articles and threads pointing out the "<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Sign in with a local account instead" option in the account settings. However, I do not have such an option in
 my account settings (Win 10 Pro Version 1511 Build 10586). The next thing to the "Manage my Microsoft account" link is "Your picture".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I need this&nbsp;</span>administrator account to be a normal, local account once again. Is there anything I can do other than reinstalling Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 Can&#39;t Read UDF Disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael t. bunney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Can&#39;t Read UDF Disc</h2>
                    <p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Pro 3</li><li>LG External USB Blu-ray Writer, Model No. BE14NU40</li><li>Windows 8.1 with all Windows Updates installed</li></ul>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Windows can't read the contents of&nbsp;CD-RW discs created by a previous version of Windows.&nbsp; Instead it shows only three files:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Autorun.inf</li><li>UdfrChk.exe</li><li>udfrinst.zl</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've read online, UdfrChk.exe is a UDF reader driver that can be installed on systems that don't have UDF support in order to read standard UDF CD's and DVD's.&nbsp; However, even when I ran this (as Administrator, which it required in order to create
 temporary files) and rebooted as instructed when it completed successfully, Windows still could not read the true disc contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I Have Ruled Out:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>This is not caused by a bad disc.&nbsp; </strong>I can read the same disc on another computer running Windows 7 SP1.</li><li><strong>This is not caused by the fact that the disc was created by a different computer.</strong>&nbsp; Some posts on this site say that&nbsp;rewritable UDF discs can only be read on the computer that created them.&nbsp; (This is certainly news to me if true!)&nbsp; However,
 I can read this disc on another computer (running Windows 7 with SP1) that did not create the CD, using the built-in DVD drive on that computer.</li><li><strong>This is not caused by the drive.&nbsp; </strong>If I connect the external USB drive that can't read the disc when attached to my Windows 8.1 machine to a Windows 7 SP1 machine, the disc can be read using that drive as well.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the same disc can be read using the same drive under Windows 7 on a machine that didn't create the disc, but can't be read under Windows 8.1, this appears to be broken functionality in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a significant number of discs burned under previous versions of Windows that I expect to continue to be readable in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; UDF is a standard, current file format.&nbsp; If previous versions of Windows wrote these discs, Microsoft has a responsibility
 to ensure that current versions of Windows continue to be able to read them.</p>

<p>Hello Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your motherboard?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I'd suggest running the built-in troubleshooter in Windows 10, refer to the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This troubleshooter automatically diagnoses and repair common problems with wireless and other network adapters.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + I</strong></em>, then select <strong>
<em>Update &amp; Security</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to <em><strong>Troubleshoot</strong></em>, run the <strong><em>Network Adapter</em></strong> troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, verify if the WLAN service is enabled. To check, refer to the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>services.msc</strong></em> and press
<em><strong>Enter</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Scroll down and locate <em><strong>WLAN AutoConfig</strong></em>, right-click on it and select
<em><strong>Properties</strong></em>.</p>
<p>3. Make sure that the <em><strong>Startup type</strong></em> is set to <strong>
<em>Automatic</em></strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click <em><strong>Apply </strong></em>and click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I've notice that there are two version of Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I which is a
<strong><a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GC-WB867D-I-rev-42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rev. 4.2</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GC-WB867D-I-rev-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rev 1.0.</a></strong> Kindly double check the exact model of your network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there could be a possibility that your wireless card has been disabled in the BIOS<strong>.
</strong>You can check for the steps by going to your computer's (motherboard) manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds as though you are going through a deployment scenario.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Txtsetup.sif file is actually created as part of the deployment process.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Based on this, it would probably be best to seek assistance in the technet forums:</p>

<h2>            Minecraft PvP</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span>Hey everyone~</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A&nbsp;few friends and myself are wanting to start a hardcore pvp map, and we've already got some promising players. I'll go over how the game will work.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>THE GAME:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>-We'll be starting a new random map, where last man standing wins. This means no respawning.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-There will be NO&nbsp;PvP the first 5 minutes. This&nbsp;is so&nbsp;you have time to get away from everyone, instead of starting in a brawl that kills half the players out the gate. Still,&nbsp;if someone follows you... well that's&nbsp;kind
 of your problem to deal with. Just nooo pvp for 5 minutes.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-Difficulty will be on hard.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-The idea of having 2man teams is likely, so grab a friend. Or, we may pair two strangers up. You ARE allowed to kill your teammate...If&nbsp;you think it will help you win, go for it. Keep in mind you could win as a pair.&nbsp;Just
 sayin.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>That's pretty much it.&nbsp; We aren't restricting much.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The game will start&nbsp;on Saturday afternoon. (July-27-2013)&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving people who work a shot. It'll be a somewhat short game, feel free to join and see what you can do. Show off what you're made of. Plus,&nbsp;you'll meet some
 good people during it all. </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note: I encourage you practice starting fresh on a new map.&nbsp; Speed acquire&nbsp;equipment and ect. We want a good game :p Good luck.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My gamertag is TS42119</p>

<h3> lesliecaldwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent windows 10 update, now when I click on the start menu button nothing happens and I can not open the tiles window at all.</h2>
                    I recently installed an update to my windows 10 and went on about my business.&nbsp; Now, a few days later I find that I can't open the tiles or anything else from the start menu button and I have to right click on it to even get to the power off link. When
 I first did the update I ended up having to clear out temp files to make room to do the actual update.&nbsp; Not sure if that is relevant but it was part of the process.&nbsp; I've seen topics that look like they are the same problem, but when I start reading them,
 they are not.&nbsp; I'm not very tech savvy so all the complicated processes need to be dumbed down to make sense.&nbsp;

<h2>            Console glitches</h2>
                    
<p><span>I bought a brand new XBOX 360 4GB slim about 3 weeks ago from GameStop.&nbsp; I initally bought three used games for it just to have something to play until I felt like buying more.&nbsp; One game froze on
 me randomly one time so I didn't think anything about it.&nbsp; The second game freezes on my everytime I press a certain action button but no other buttons.&nbsp; The third game randomly has a corrupt save file and makes me start the game over.&nbsp; I decided to try the
 whole live thing out and bought battlefield bad company 2.&nbsp; Now I've had three times with this where I'll be in the middle of a match and all of a sudden the XBOX just resets.&nbsp; Like completely, the turn on screen and home screen and everything, not just the
 games home screen.&nbsp; The guy at GameStop said the odds of every single game I bought causing issues is highly unlikely and it's most likely a defective console and to just bring it back and swap it.&nbsp; Any ideas?</span></p>

<p>Ok that's what I figured. &nbsp;Is overheating an issue with the new slims? &nbsp;This sucker blows some really hot air after about an hour of play but the guy said that the cooling on the new style slims wasn't an issue and no need to buy an intercooler. &nbsp;Related
 to the previous question I guess.</p>

<p>He is correct about that too. That console was designed to pump tons of hot air out, which keeps its insides nice and cool. Just make sure that there is lot's of open space around the console, so that crucial airflow isn't obstructed.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The application is not responding. The program may respond again if you wait. Do you want to proceed&#63; everytime laptop is switched on</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/471da377-3545-4d2a-99ae-4ef3f42ebea9" /><span>I'm using an Asus G750JH with a pre-installed Windows 8. The problem started occuring last night when I
 was trying to switch on my laptop. After logging in my password I was brought to the desktop only that there's nothing on it except for my wallpaper and a start menu that can't be clicked. There's also a watermark at the bottom right corner saying "Windows
 8.1 Single Language Build 9600". Clicking anywhere changes the cursor into that loading circle thing and a minute after that a pop uo window from Microsoft Windows saying "The application is not responding. The program may respond again if you wait. Do you
 want to proceed?" comes out. I can choose to End Process or Cancel. Ending the process will only repeat the same thing again, cancelling and waiting didn't brought my anywhere for 5 hours. I tried to close my laptop and start it up again. The same thing happened
 every single time. At one time I noticed at the password screen, when I clicked at the power button there was "Restart and update". I thought installing the update will fix it, so I clicked on it my and it stucked on the Restart screen, waited for a couple
 of hours and nothing.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The last time when it was working I only used it to play a game on Steam, and I tried to install a software for a broadband modem but I cancelled it halfway. Could this be the problem? Anyone else facing the same problem as mine and knows how to fix
 it?</span></p>

</p><p>If you cannot login, you can still reach Safe Mode. On the login screen, click the Power icon, then hold down SHIFT on the keyboard while you click Restart. Keep holding shift until the next screen appears, then use it to go into Safe Mode.</p>

            <p>Also have the same issue. Quickbooks suddenly stopped working. I've tried re-installing it and going through the steps you sent but it doesn't work. It just crashes with the same error:</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your&nbsp;answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will try on the link you suggest later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had installed this QB Pro 2011 by CD/DVD in 2011 with Window 7.&nbsp; Then I got free upgrade to&nbsp;Window 10&nbsp;about six months ago &amp;&nbsp;QuickBooks Pro 2011&nbsp;also working too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the last week Window 10 Version 1607 update batch&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;then&nbsp;QuickBooks Pro 2011
 totally&nbsp;stopped working&nbsp;completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I has&nbsp;seen the quick pop up message which indicated that Window 10 somehow see TWO version of QBs&nbsp;( for example : enterprise&nbsp; &amp; regular QB) &nbsp;when I try to login, so It did not know which ones to open.&nbsp; Hope this help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a bug in that update.&nbsp; Hope&nbsp; someone can pick out this bug.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think QuickBooks has anything to do with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to log on to use QuickBooks for 6 months after update from Window 7 to Window 10 until 9/21/2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I can not even log on to QuickBooks anymore after update Window 10 Version
 1607 on 9/22/16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not making any sense at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping someone in this community can help debug this problem.</p>

            <p>Your right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not QuickBooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the piece of crap update that rolled out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it broke any version of QuickBooks prior to 2015 and as of yet, I've not seen a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 2010 QuickBooks that worked great prior to the update. After, would not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent hours trying all the different things with no success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I needed to use the program, I had had to update to QuickBooks 2017 and port over the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cost me 249 bucks plus hours of wasted time following tips from this forum that were worthless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck getting it fixed.</p>

            I have contacted QuickBooks.&nbsp; They claim that because their product was working perfectly prior to the update, this is a Windows issue.&nbsp; Windows claims it is not their software so they can't assist us.&nbsp; Maybe it's time for a Mac...

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QuickBooks won't do anything because this is not their problems &amp; it was working before Window 10 Update V1607.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to start QB Pro from&nbsp;Task Manager window, an set compatibility mode for Window7.&nbsp; Here is the pop up msg from window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "QuickBooks can't start because it is already running.&nbsp; Only QuickBooks Accountant and QuickBooks Enterprise can open more than one company file"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there&nbsp;are conflict codes in the Window10 update to cause this&nbsp;happen.&nbsp; I know Microsoft can fix this problem.</p>

<p>I have a problem with hearing voice when I call someone. </p>
<p>I can call the echo service and complete the sound check, if switch to another application and wait 20 seconds. When I try to repeat right after that calling to echo service, it produces a sound of calling and then nothing.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 won&#39;t detect bluetooth adaptor. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superhobo666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t detect bluetooth adaptor.</h2>
                    Just before christmas, i purchased a Gateway NV58 (yes, i searched through their support, and found NO help, even through contacting them.)<br />
<br />
everything worked fine and dandy before I upgraded to windows 7. now however, My bluetooth adaptor no longer works, i downloaded drivers off the gateway support site, and attempted to install them, I got an error message "Could not Detect bluetooth devices"
 so i figure maybe i need to turn on the adapter. so i hit the bluetooth button to turn it on (which worked in vista) but now, the adaptor will not turn on. (it shows&nbsp; bluetooth icon on screen with a red x over it, meaning it isn't on.) multiple attempts provided
 the same image. (Screenshot: http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r189/superhobo666/theimage.png )<br />
I figure it won't turn on without the proper drivers, but the driver wants the adapter on so it can find the adaptor.
<br />
<br />
Anybody else have the same product, or know of a fix?<br />
(I even updated the BIOS and had no luck.)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to mention, it's a built in adaptor

            Hey superhobo666,<br />
<br />
RED X indicates that your blue tooth device is not connected or corrupt. i know that it is built-in bluetooth device so it should be connected.&nbsp; just to make sure which on is causing problem (windows 7 or corrupt bluetooth device)&nbsp; try installing vista in another
 partition and check if your bluetooth device works properly there.&nbsp; if it works properly in vista then it means that windows 7 is causing the problem, then we can try troubleshooting it. if in case it doesn't work in&nbsp; vista then for sure your blue tooth is
 corrupt know, to fix it you have to take your laptop to its manufacturer.<br />

<p><span>Hi criddles66,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software or hardware?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to restart the computer and perform startup repair and then try to do system Restore.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to
 fix it so your computer can start correctly. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc.</span></p>
