    <title>Windows 10 BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I have been experiencing issues for some time now with seemingly random BSODs , sometimes they even happen when the computer is just sitting idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run more memtests and chkdirs than I can count at this point in time and have had no luck in uncovering any issues. I have done a clean install of Windows more than once since this started, and have also swapped graphics cards as well a couple complete
 uninstalls of the drivers and then fresh re-installs. I have cycled through each of my individual sticks of RAM and still the issue persisted. I am at my wits end and ready to hit my PC with a brick. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Below you
 will find a link to a zip of my last 3 dumps and the output from msinfo.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I did not make any changes prior to the issue arising.</li><li>I built this PC myself.</li></ul>
<p>The issue has persisted through several updates to Windows and various driver upgrades. I am inclined to believe that the issue is hardware related as I have 0 wiped my c drive and reinstalled windows no less than 4 times since first encountering the issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply, what is the BSOD error received on the PC?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are unable to access the link shared in the description. BSOD errors are usually caused due to the corrupted, non-updated or incompatible device drivers installed or conflict between the drivers
 and OS installed on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are facing black screen issues, I suggest you to boot the PC in
<strong>Safe mode </strong>and check if similar issue persists on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reboot</span></strong><span> the PC to exit from
<strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)
</strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 becomes very slow after startup and starts making a noise. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 becomes very slow after startup and starts making a noise. Works fine in safe-mode.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>When I start up my Acer Aspire One netbook, it works fine for the first minute or so. Then it gets so slow that it takes several minutes for anything to open, including task manager, control panel, etc. When this starts happening, a noise starts coming from
 either the fan or the hard drive. It repeats in a pattern and sounds like the computer is snoring.</p>
<p>I managed to get to the task manager to look at the performance. The CPU usage was normal, and the memory usage was about 600MB out of 1GB, so it is not from too many startup programs.</p>
<p>Could it be bad RAM or the CPU fan going bad?</p>
<p>If I start it in safe-mode, it seems to work fine. This makes me think it is not a hardware problem but maybe some feature in normal-mode that is not enabled in safe-mode.</p>
<p>Has anyone had this problem or know what it could be?</p>

<p>1 GByte of RAM for Windows 7? You will get a lot of paging activitiy with so little memory. I thought the recommended amount was 2 GBytes, with 4 GBytes a good value.</p>
<p>You can check your hard disk by downloading and running the diagnostic program that your disk manufacturer has on his home page. Do this to find out the disk manufacturer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the command WinMSD </li><li>Follow this path: Component / Storage / Disks </li><li>Check the Manufacturer or Model in the right-hand pane. </li></ul>

<p>It is actually Windows 7 Starter, which is a special version for netbooks and only requires 1GB RAM. Like I said, the task manager said the system was only using 600MB. I don't think it's the hard drive either, except for the clicking noise.</p>
<p>These are my guesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The RAM is bad, so the hard drive is having to take the load and act as RAM. This would explain why it is slow and the clicking noise.</li><li>There is some Windows 7 feature that is corrupted and cause the computer to run slowly, which would explain why everything works fine in safe-mode.</li><li>The CPU fan is going bad, so the computer is getting too hot and running slowly. This would explain the clicking noise and why it works fine for a minute when it starts up.</li></ul>
<div>Do any of these seem correct? Could it be something else? How can I check these things?</div>

This would explain the clicking noise and why it works fine for a minute when it starts up.</li></ul>
<div>Do any of these seem correct? Could it be something else? How can I check these things?</div>

No, not quite.<br />
<ul>
<li>If the RAM is bad then your machine will crash as soon as it tries to access the bad portion. There is no room for tolerance here.</li><li>A clicking disk is usually a dying disk. I mentioned before how you can test it.</li><li>A overheating CPU could indeed cause a slow-down, depending on how it is designed. You can test it by its noise level and by the amount of air it blows. CPU fans can and do seize up.</li><li>If the factory forgot to add heat-conducting paste to the underside of the CPU during assembly then it will always run too hot. Only a disassembly would reveal this.</li></ul>

<p>The computer doesn't slow down and doesn't make the clicking noise when it is in safe-mode. If it was the hard drive, it seems to me it would click no matter what mode I am in.</p>
<p>I checked the CPU temperature with Everest, and it was 48C, which I read was normal.</p>
<p>Let me describe exactly what happens when I start it in normal mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer runs normally for about 1 minute.&nbsp; </li><li>If I log in before this minute is over, I can get in. However, if I wait to log into Windows, it will freeze at the log in (sometimes it stays at "Logging in" screen, sometimes it goes to a black screen).</li><li>If I log in, after the minute, the computer becomes extremely slow. The mouse will move at normal speed, and the start menu will open quickly, but if I click anything to open it, it takes several minutes before anything happens. Even if I simply right-click
 on the desktop it takes several minutes before the menu appears. </li></ul>
<div>Thank you for your help so far. Do you have any other ideas?</div>

            In my experience a clicking disk is a dying disk. However, since you believe that you do not have a problem while in Safe Mode, here is the strategy used when isolating problems that occur in that mode only:<br />
<ul>
<li>Boot into Safe Mode</li><li>Click Start</li><li>Type the word msconfig into the Search box and press Enter</li><li>Untick every tick mark under the Startup tab.</li><li>Click the Services tab, then tick the box that hides the Microsoft services.</li><li>Untick every remaining tick mark.</li><li>Physically disconnect the machine from the Internet.</li><li>Reboot in Normal Mode.</li><li>If this fixes the problem, restore the tick marks in groups of 4 until you find the culprit, then leave it unticked.</li><li>Restore your Internet connection when finished.</li></ul>

            I know this issue hasn't been updated in a few months, but this weekend I started having this *exact* same problem. &nbsp;It acts like it's a virus or malware, but both MS Security Essentials and Malwarebytes show no problems. &nbsp;Everything works fine in safe
 mode, the pc will run for hours with absolutely no problems. &nbsp;When I boot normally, I get the exact same results as the original poster - it will run fine for a couple of minutes or so and then it grinds to a halt. &nbsp;It doesn't completely freeze, because often
 if you leave it alone for a while (sometimes hours) and come back it will do whatever you have told it to do, but obviously it's unusable like this. &nbsp;I have unchecked everything from startup and still get the exact same results. &nbsp;I am running Win 7 Ultimate
 64bit btw.
<div><br />
<div>I managed to start task manager once and it showed normal resource usage (until the pc slowed down &amp; it stopped updating) - memory usage around 30% and cpu usage around 1-2%. &nbsp;I'm afraid I"m looking at a reformat, but I'd really like to avoid that if at
 all possible - any other suggestions? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW, there's no clicking on my hdd, but you can hear it being accessed which might be what the original poster was referring to. &nbsp;At any rate, my hdd does not sound unusual and I have no reason to suspect it, but I will run a test on it when I get home
 tonight. &nbsp;</div>

            Just today I've begun to have the same exact problems. Start my laptop, boots, logs in<br />
<br />
Then,<br />
<br />
all problems arise. Mouse moves fine, severe lag with trying to open any files - even task manager. Moving the mouse over an icon will also cause explorer to freeze.<br />
<br />
and everything is fine in Safe mode, no clicking noises. I have an HP Pavilion DV7, 3 years old.<br />
<br />
I unselected all the items in the 'Startup' under msconfig. The 'hanging' is still occuring<br />

            I have a suggestion for getting the files you want. Try to get a copy of Ubuntu and without installing it, while in Ubuntu you can access the partition with windows, then add an external HDD or whatever and then copy files. Restart and take out cd and
 then re-install.

<h3> toddferguson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Version of Windows is not  genuine &#34; Windows 7&#34;</h2>
                    Original Title: 2 days ago I start getting a notice that my Windows 7 might not be valid..<br />
<br />
I purchased my new 24" Samsung flat touch screen from Best Buy back in October 2011..So I've had it for some time. It was purchased with Windows 7 already installed. 2 days ago when I turned my computer on I get this notice saying that my version of Windows
 7 may not be valid and to download this validation tool..I download and run through process..and it's saying it's invalid..It's result says " Windows has not yet been activated with a genuine product key. Not to worry, we can help you with that." How can it
 all of a sudden after almost 2 years be invalid? It was purchased brand new from Best Buy. Now all of a sudden it's asking me to spend another 100$ after the 1000$ on this one for a new registration key..Any help would be REALLY APPRECIATED.<br />

<span>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's computer
 hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key, but
 should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of
 Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

<h2>            Question about internet connections on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I would like to know one thing about connecting to internet in windows 10:</p>
<p>If I connect my pc to both ethernet and wifi will it use the internet from just ethernet, just wifi or both at the same time.</p>
<p>If it uses only one source of connection then is it possible to tweak the settings so windows would use both sources at the same time so I can get faster internet?</p>
<p>I have 2 routers one is connected to pc via wifi and other via ethernet. Is it possible to use both to get double internet speed?</p>

            Hi ToXicShadow
<br />
<br />Windows would automatically favour the Ethernet connection, because that is generally stronger . .. ..
<br />
<br />You can bridge both connections to force Windows to use both connections
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Network and Sharing
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'Change Adapter Settings'
<br />
<br />Select those two connections, then right click and choose 'Bridge Connections'

<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update - Sleep in no longer an option, even in power options currently unavailable.</h2>
                    After installing the Creators Update, my Acer Aspire E5-571 had quite a few issues I managed to fix all of them except Sleep is not an option in my power settings and when I select 'Change settings that are currently unavailable', there is no sleep option
 there either.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution for me?&nbsp; I've tried everything I could think of except playing with BIOS, which I wouldn't try without specific instructions.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.

<p>I check your system for drivers and most were from 2015 but are identified as Win 10 drivers.&nbsp; Depending on whether you have Intel (Broadwell) or Nvidia would determine which one you needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Bios update from 2016 which may help although updating the Bios can be dangerous.&nbsp; Make sure the system is powered before starting and do not interrupt the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an Acer community which might give you more specific info about your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open an admin command prompt and enter <strong>shutdown /?</strong> it will show some switches that command can use.&nbsp; Try the basic
<strong>shutdown /s</strong> to see if the system shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I tried everything the community suggested for the last month and everything failed.&nbsp; I did a little more research (dangerous with my limited education in this field) and ended up crossing my fingers, downloading and installing an Intel driver from June
 of 2016 <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>(</span></span>Beta_15.40.26.64.4474).&nbsp; I don't know what features or functions I might have lost or compromised, but I got sleep back and I see no obvious downside
 so I'm happy.</p>

    <title>Microsoft&#39;s Outlook Calendar Color -- Figuring Out&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daffyduckkangaroo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s Outlook Calendar Color -- Figuring Out&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been using my Outlook&nbsp;calendar for years, and I do know how -- and where to go --&nbsp;to change the general color background from light to dark and how to change the color background of my appointments, but all of a sudden a hot pink color has turned up,
 seemingly out of nowhere: it appears when I delete an appointment or change anything I've written -- in a thick line -- and it also appears when I hover my pointer over my appointments and the written&nbsp;letters appear in the same font but in a hot pink color.
 It's very annoying, kind of blinding.&nbsp;I have no idea why it suddenly appeared and I don't know how or where to go to change it to a simple clear when deleting or a simple black when using my pointer.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daffy</p>

<p>Hi Daffy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We do get your point regarding this issue. If you don’t like the way Outlook looks like by default, you can change the types, sizes and colors in Outlook. Please be guided on the steps below on how you can change the general color background of Outlook and
 appointments. </p>
<p><br />
1. Go to <strong>File.</strong></p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Office Account.</strong></p>
<p>3. Choose the color from the <strong>Office theme</strong> drop-down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the background color of your calendar, please check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-background-color-of-your-calendar-3C544857-8446-46A5-AB9C-07B6AF6E5091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong><strong>.</strong>
 To change color for one appointment in Outlook, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click the appointment. </p>
<p>2. Select the <strong>Category</strong> from the drop-down list, and specify a color from the sub-menu.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><br />
If you want to change color for multiple appointments, please check the steps below:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><br />
1. Shift to the Calendar view, and open the Calendar folder where you will change color for multiple appointments.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">2. Click the <strong>View Settings</strong> button on the
<strong>View</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.extendoffice.com%2fimages%2fstories%2fdoc-outlook%2fappointment-color%2fdoc-appointment-color-2.png" height="153" width="497" /></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">3. In the opening dialog box, click the
<strong>Conditional Formatting</strong> button (or <strong>Automatic Formatting </strong>
button).</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.extendoffice.com%2fimages%2fstories%2fdoc-outlook%2fappointment-color%2fxdoc-appointment-color-3.png.pagespeed.ic.0M4yOdr-I-.png" height="341" width="503" /></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">4. Now you get into the Conditional Formatting dialog box, and:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click the <strong>
Add</strong> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Enter a name for the new rule in the <strong>Name</strong> box.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Click the <strong>
Color </strong>box, and specify a color from the drop down list, see screenshot below:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Click the <strong>
Condition </strong>button.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.extendoffice.com%2fimages%2fstories%2fdoc-outlook%2fappointment-color%2fdoc-appointment-color-4.png" height="376" width="350" /></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">5. In the popping up Filter dialog box, specify your filter criteria.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">6. Click all <strong>OK</strong> buttons to close all dialog boxes.</p>
<p><br />
If the issue still occurs, please let us know if you are accessing your Outlook email using the Outlook application (if yes, which version?) or via the web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>First, thanks for your comprehensive answer, but I think I made a mistake in describing the calendar as Outlook, because I don't see your images on my calendar. I am referring to the calendar that comes with my Microsoft account -- Outlook is listed on its
 lower left-hand side, but as seen below. I know where to change colors, in general, but now the hot pink.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daffy</p>

<p>The Windows Update progress bar is not updated during the scan, and progress seems to stop at 60% complete for some time.

    <title>iPhone Photos and Videos don&#39;t show on Photos App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtsos  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone Photos and Videos don&#39;t show on Photos App</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10 with only a few issues and I'm enjoying the new environment. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The main&nbsp;problem: On the photo App, I no longer see the photos&nbsp;or videos on my iPhone 6 when plug in my iPhone.
<br />
Under Windows 8, I used to plug in&nbsp;my iPhone and then import them and save the new photos and videos (It recognized that old photos didn't need to be re-imported) to my PC (ThinkPad X230).<br />
<br />
Now I only see my iCloud photos which don't include recent videos (But they do show on the Apple Cloud).&nbsp; Also, I'm not able to do anything with these Photo App pictures&nbsp;except look at them.&nbsp; I see no way to save them to a file.<br />
<br />
When I try to import, it churns and says&nbsp;"We found&nbsp;1345 photos and 117 videos". That 1345 number's frustrating because 90% of these I've already imported under Windows 8, but I guess it's trying to start from scratch.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Or not. When I click on "import" I get "Something went wrong." No kidding? And so informative.<br />
<br />
Ideas on how I can see the phtos and videos on my iPhone when it's plugged into the PC and how I can them import them?

<h2>            WiFi suddenly disappeared in Windows 10 version 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I would like to share my problem where the <strong>WiFi disappeared like it was never there</strong>, the problem I am facing since I updated to the creators update 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6478b2a4-a01c-422d-bd31-0b95f77ba0c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6478b2a4-a01c-422d-bd31-0b95f77ba0c4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some solutions I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Tried network reset from settings.</p>
<p>2. Tried uninstalling reinstalling the WiFi device from device manager.</p>
<p>3. Tried reboot.</p>
<p>4. Tried updating the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why I think my&nbsp;WiFi hardware is working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It's showing in device manager.</p>
<p>2. It's working just fine on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I found how the problem happens on my PC especially, I turned off the&nbsp;WiFi from the network in the taskbar and after some time it removes itself from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more images explaining my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Not even showing&nbsp;WiFi in settings</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436898cf-c988-4683-afed-abeae7c9049f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436898cf-c988-4683-afed-abeae7c9049f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Shows&nbsp;WiFi device in device manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/661a1967-a207-4cd4-a9a6-10f545131654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/661a1967-a207-4cd4-a9a6-10f545131654" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am facing this problem for the second time now, hope it gets resolved.</p>
<p>I know I can solve this problem by resetting Windows but I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your earliest reply for me to solve this problem else I would have to reinstall Windows 10 1607 Anniversary update.</p>

If for some reason your installation of Windows 10 locks up on you and will not proceed (or you're facing a black screen problem)—this could have something to do with an inherent corruption in your previous version of Windows. The only way to properly fix this
 issue is to re-install your previous version of Windows fresh. Once you have it installed—activate it—and from there you should be able to jump straight into Windows 10 by using the method provided above".</p>

<p>Before you proceed below, make backups!!!!! If you mess this up Im not responsible! Always make full clone backups before making changes like this!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were two things with me that was causing the issue above on several of my families pcs. One is caused when people have pcs using a small SDD drive to run their computers and the page file is having issues adjusting. What I did to fix this was select
 start, then Control Panel, then clicked System &amp; Security, then click system. Look down in the section that says "Computer Name, domain, and workgroup settings" and click on Change settings.
</p>
<p>Now click the advanced tab and right below it with windows 7, you will see Peformance - Visual effects, processor scheduling, memory usage, and virtual memory. Click settings and another advanced tab, which down below you will see virtual memory. Click change.
 DO NOT SHUT PAGEFILE OFF - It will do bad things to your PC if you do! Uncheck Automatically manage page file size for all drives, and select a hard drive with lots of space to move the page file to. When you found the partition you want to use, select System
 Managed size and the SDD select no paging file. Again, do not turn off the paging file, it will do bad things without it. Once you turn it on, on one partition, and turn it off from your SDD, apply and ok everything and allow your computer to reboot.
</p>
<p>The second problem causing this is the system partition you wont have visible normally. This is the other problem as this file is set to 100mb. You will need to use a program like minitool partition Wizzard and shrink one partition 300mbs and then enlarge
 the 100mb to 400mb. You will have to allow the pc to reboot to make the changes. Once done, try again to upgrade to windows 10 and now all should work fine unless something new comes up. This worked for me!!!</p>

<h2>            CPU frequency is at 0.05 GHz&#63;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; pls help&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>this is a <strong>acer netbook... </strong>with <strong>Pentium processor n3710....&nbsp;</strong>running windows 10 creators update latest(15063.447)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this weird problem since anniversary update... it started when my netbook suddenly became very slow... unresponsive . I somehow managed to open the task manager to see what was causing this... I checked disk usage is normal...ram is ok.... at first
 I didn't check the cpu.... and went to the processes tab.....everything was ok there...... then it became normal... again... I though it to be a rare case... ..but again.... it happened then this time I figured out that when I checked accidentally checked
 into the cpu tab...the usage the normal but the frequency was <strong>0.05 Ghz</strong> ...cpu was badly underclocked&nbsp;</p>
<p>pls note that..<strong>i was running the battery saver mode and balanced profile...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched google then found out that<strong> intel HD gpu causes this if the drivers are not installed properly</strong>..... as it sounds the problems occured right after windows 10 fresh install when the gpu drivers are yet to be installed.... so I thought
 I fixed the issue and will never happen again...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it happened again today although the drivers are installed properly..... made me think HD drivers might not be the cause after all..... I cant get a screenshot of this (I will try though)... since nothing is responsive&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with any ideas how to solve this??</p>

<p>Hi Saiyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you encountered after the update could be caused by a software conflict. For us to determine what software could be causing it, we suggest performing a clean boot. For the detailed steps how to do this process, please refer to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the issue persists, you may continue with running the System File Checker tool to help scan and restore possible corrupted Windows system files. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Right-click the <strong>Windows</strong> key and select <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the command prompt window, type the below command <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Connecting to Non-Preferred Networks - Make it Stop&#33;</h2>
                    <div>I'm using a Lenovo T420 running Windows 7 - recently upgraded wireless card to Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Lately, when waking up my computer, it automatically connects to a typical unsecured "linksys" network rather than our own. The linksys network is not in our list of preferred networks. In Windows XP there was an option to disable auto-connection to non-preferred
 networks. I can't find this option in Windows 7. I have looked around online, but can't find any helpful information.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Our wireless network does not broadcast it's SSID - but we have had no issues during the first 3 months of owning the laptop. It has started happening occasionally since replacing the wireless card. Regardless of whether or not the computer can easily
 find our home network, it should NOT be connecting to other unsecured networks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, drivers are up to date and networking is managed by Windows - so I don't see how the network card upgrade could be the issue.</div>

    <title>Windows Defender suddenly showed up oin my system&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wingclip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender suddenly showed up oin my system&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi Folks,</span></p>

<p><span>I have just discovered that Windows Defender is now installed in my OS! I have Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit and I had to load it fresh from a Disc when I bought my brand new HP about 1.5 years
 ago. I have Windows Security Essentials and never requested the Windows Defender.</span></p>

<p><span>I am experiencing some headaches that have suddenly began regarding my processor's ability to maintain a good running game of MS FSX. Without going into irrelevant material, please take my word
 for it when I say that I have been running that FSX game beautifully for 7 months. Then a few days ago I find myself in the middle of one system crash after another. I kept backing off my scenery sliders and other tuning adjustments that come with FSX but
 I still kept crashing!</span></p>

<p><span>Among other things/tools, I use AMD Fusion and set it to give max performance whilst still keeping the ability to log into the web. As I was searching through the profile that indicates what programs
 are still running and which are not, I suddenly spotted Windows Defender!</span></p>

<p><span>It's not supposed to be on this system and is in direct conflict with MSE as I understood when I loaded MSE way back when. Windows Defender does not show up in the list of un-installable programs
 via the control panel method. </span></p>

<p><span>So how do I uninstall it? Not so important, (but equally worrisome), is why it's on my system in the first place? But I really need to know how to get rid of it. At the moment I turned it off
 using the Systems control panel via task manager by choosing "Disable". </span></p>

<p><span>In that panel there's a box that shows this: "C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k secsvcs", under the statement "Path to executable". But I don't know what I can do with it really, (partly because
 I'm not sure what "Path to the executable" means). I was going to hunt down the folder and if possible re-name the exe file. Does anyone think that may work?</span></p>

<p><span>I read somewhere something about not being able to uninstall Win Def in win &amp; and Vista systems but I don't know if that's true. So maybe renaming it will keep it from 'rising from the dead'.</span></p>

<p><span>Thank You.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Community for advice on how to hopefully reset your Family Control Passcode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can totally see how not being able to access all the features of this console your friend sold you could be disheartening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say that if you were unable to reset the passcode for the console as outlined in the previously posted links, then I would strongly suggest contacting
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customer Support</a> to see if they can help walk you though the process or find out what's preventing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give that a shot and let us know if they were able to help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I get Windows 10 Photo App to show pictures</h2>
                    <p>On my laptop, Windows 10 Photo App works okay, but on my desktop it will not show my pictures when I select the Folders tab. It show where the folders are located but when I click on a folder, it opens to a screen that reads "No readable photos, videos,
 or folders found".</p>
<p>I have performed all of the suggestions I have found in the Community, ran troubleshoot, did a rest, and did an clean boot. None of these work.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, WalterJessup
<br />
<br />Follow these steps. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />First, make sure all the latest updates have been installed - click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Photos 
<br />Select it 
<br />Click Advanced options 
<br />Click Reset 
<br />
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Check the Store for updates 
<br />
<br />If that does not work give this a try then: 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type the following, hit Enter the restart. 
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage *Microsoft.Windows.Photos* | remove-appxpackage 
<br />
<br />Download again from the Store: 
<br />
<br />Get Microsoft Photos - Microsoft Store

            Hi WalterJessup, 
<br />
<br />The security permissions might not be working as intended. Please do the below:
<br />- Right click the pictures folder
<br />- Select Properties
<br />- Select the Security tab
<br />- Select the Advanced button
<br />- Select the Add button
<br />- Select 'Select a principal' 
<br />- Enter your Windows username (i.e Walter) in the 'Enter the object name to select' field and press OK
<br />- Tick the box next to Full Control and press OK
<br />- Tick the box next to 'Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object' 
<br />- Select OK, and OK again
<br />
<br />If you get a deny error message when pressing OK for the last time, you might need to take ownership of the folder/files:
<br />- Right click the pictures folder
<br />- Select Properties
<br />- Select the Security tab
<br />- Select the Advanced button
<br />- Select the Change button next to the Owner field at the top of the window
<br />- Enter your Windows username (i.e Walter) in the 'Enter the object name to select' field and press OK
<br />- Tick the box next to 'Replace owner on subcontainers and objects' and press OK to apply these settings
<br />- Perform the steps above after taking ownership
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            Ok I understand good, finally I recommend you follow these steps; if they do not work I recommend that you completely repair the Windows, below I'll leave the link on how to do it.
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

            This did not work either. Thanks for your time and suggestions. I don't think I will go the route of completely repairing Windows 10 since all of the other things I do on this computer are working just fine. I have my laptop that I can use whenever I want
 to use Photos.&nbsp;

            You can access them the same way as with XP ( disregarding the Libraries).<br />
Go to Start &gt; Computer &gt; C:\ and find the Program Files folder. <br />
You will notice that Win7 has three such folders instead of the single folder used by XP.<br />
<br />
[ EDIT: Maybe I misread. If you can't find the download, go to C:\ Users \ Your user folder \ Downloads<br />
for the default download directory.<br />
If you don't find the downloaded file there then, if you use Firefox, you open the 'Downloads' Tool,<br />
R/click and select 'Open Containing Folder' . ]<br />
<br />
If you aren't interested in using the Libraries you can pin folders to the Windows Explorer icon<br />
in the Taskbar.&nbsp; Make a shortcut for the folder and drag it from the desktop to the WE folder.<br />
You then R/click the WE folder to open the list. <br />

    <title>How to stop WLM and set Win 10 Mail as default&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilyazeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop WLM and set Win 10 Mail as default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For years, I used WLM and it appeared as an option in the right click menu. So, if I wanted to send a file by email, I would point to it, right click and chose "Send to default mail recipient" and the file would be sent by WLM. Now I have the Win 10 Mail
 as my default mail client, however, the WLM still is the only option in the right click menu...</p>
<p>How to "deactivate" WLM in the right click menu and set WIN 10 Mail as default?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion. As I mentioned it&nbsp;in my original post, WIN 10 Mail is already&nbsp;my default mail client. I set it the way you suggested long ago. Nevertheless, it is not available in the right click&nbsp;context menu, only WLM is still there.</p>
<p>So, to clarify and rephrase&nbsp;my problem, I know how to remove WLM from the "Send to", but I need to find a way to add (insert) WIN 10 Mail into "Send to" menu. Just setting&nbsp;WIN 10 Mail&nbsp;as default do not solve the problem.</p>

            It doesn't work in Win 10, and is unlikely to be fixed.&nbsp; The only way to use end to: Mail recipient is to use a desktrop mail client such as Outlook, eM Client, Windows Live mail, Thunderbird.

            <p>You're right about WLM "working" with other accounts. However, since it does not work with my Outlook.com account, it has no use for me.
</p>
<p>And it is true that you did not say that eM Client is free. This I "discovered" myself after installation. And you're right again providing path for eM Client default. Of course, I made it default from the beginning. Nevertheless, the Send to link open WLM
 only! I don't want to uninstall WLM. It contain great volume of old messages, addresses...</p>
