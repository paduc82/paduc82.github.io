    <title>Outlook inbox not showing latest recent emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melvin tan 72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook inbox not showing latest recent emails</h2>
                    After my recent upgrade to Win8.1, my Outlook inbox started having a weird symptom. When I select accounts setting to download emails for a limited period of time eg. "last month", my recent and latest emails will be shown in the Inbox. If however I select
 download emails for "any time", the most recent email shown in my Inbox will be 9th Oct. I tried to switch between the settings many times, and it keeps repeating the same problem. I restarted windows, same problem. I sent a new test email to my hotmail account.
 Same problem. The irony is that I even received a new email notification but my Inbox still does not show the new email when I select download emails from "any time" setting.<br />
<br />
I used my Win XP PC and everything works fine! Seems like WIn8.1 is messing up Outlook ...<br />
<br />
This may also be related to several users saying they have not been receiving emails lately ??<br />
<br />
Separately, when I try to access my outlook folders (set up prior to win 8.1 upgrades), it will first show it is empty, then it shows "couldn't sync messages", then after a while it will show "no messages" and then after few more minutes, all the emails in
 the folder will show up. Though still able to access the mails eventually, it is really a nuisance ....<br />

            Hi Jeffrey,<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">• Does this happen when you try accessing your account from the same computer with a different browser?</span></p>
- Actually I wasn't accessing my account from a browser. I was accessing my email from the MAIL icon from the START screen.<br />
- After your reply, I tried using a browser to access the hotmail, it looks ok but having said that, in the browser format, I wasn't able to find the option to show only the last month's or last week's email only.
<br />
- When displaying ALL emails without a time limiting factor, I have no problems even with the current email&nbsp; system.<br />
- No I do not have another Win8.1 computer.<br />
<br />
The link you provided to check the settings are actually irrelevant in this case. It was meant for browser access. And in my case, the mails are actually coming in (I mentioned I even received email notifications). It's just that they are not showing up in
 the inbox when I select to view ALL emails.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Melvin<br />

            I am having a similar problem, but it is not with Outlook.com. &nbsp;It is with Office 2013's Outlook. &nbsp;I have upgraded two devices to Windows 8.1: my desktop, and my Surface Pro. &nbsp;I use Outlook of Office 2013 on my desktop. &nbsp;On my Surface, I had disabled the
 Mail app because it didn't work right with my GMail account.
<div><br />
<div>After installing 8.1 on my Surface, I thought I would give the new Mail App a try. &nbsp;It seemed to be working correctly, until what I noticed today. &nbsp;It appears that any e-mails I see in the Mail app on my Surface then do not show up at all in Office Outlook
 on my desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Checking Gmail itself in the browser, the e-mails are still there in the Inbox, but Office Outlook refuses to sync those messages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am totally baffled why 8.1's Mail app on one device would screw up what was working perfectly in Office Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's quite frustrating that Microsoft can't seem to get this right... it's EMAIL what could be easier?</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Mark, have u tried changing the download email option to last 1 month or 1 week? In my case, all the latest mails will show up, but once I select download all historical emails, the recent ones disappear,<br />

            Hi Melvin,
<div><br />
<div>I believe I have discovered that Windows Mail is attempting to keep the messages sync'd across my devices. &nbsp;Thus, if I see an e-mail in Mail on my Surface, it will not show up in Outlook on my desktop, though it does show up in the Mail app on my desktop.
 &nbsp;This is really creating a major fuster cluck because I have no idea what e-mail is where.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At first I thought, "Okay, I will just use the Mail App on my desktop and my Surface." &nbsp;However, there is a big difference in functionality between Mail and Outlook, not to mention all of my messages from the past are already in Outlook. &nbsp;I tried switching
 for two days but conclude that's not going to work well for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My only option is to disable the Mail app on both the Surface and the desktop and continue to not get my messages on the Surface. &nbsp;That is what I have been doing on the Surface since I bought it in February, but I was hoping 8.1 would fix the issue. &nbsp;It
 fixed the issues I was having originally, but has created this new problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have ONE Microsoft account. &nbsp;Why they cannot make my e-mail work properly defies explanation. &nbsp;Being a very tech-savvy person, I find this maddening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My suggestion to Microsoft: Using our account log-in, allow users to see ALL of our e-mail from whichever device and whichever Microsoft App (Office Outlook was by Microsoft last I checked) that we want! &nbsp;Why can't Outlook and Mail sync with each other
 on the same device?? And please do not tell me to use Outlook.com. &nbsp;I tried that when it was launched and really lost my place as to which e-mail was where because Outlook.com does NOT sync with Outlook the program!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mark</div>

            i was using my hotmail email account on my laptop through the microsoft outlook 2007. i tried to shift to a PC and configured the same email account to the outlook on the PC. when my outlook was getting synced to my hotmail account it started downloading
 all the email on my hotmail account to my PC. but for some strange reason my inbox on my outlook now has more emails than my hotmail account. on the other hand the emails in the smaller folders i created on my hotmail account dont seem to be getting downloaded.
 i am not understanding what seems to be the problem.<br />
<br />
please advice.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I was able to resolve this by removing my accounts from the Windows Mail program.&nbsp; It seemed that when Mail was trying to sync, then the emails no longer show up in Outlook.&nbsp; As soon as I removed the Windows Mail accounts, the emails came through fine again
 in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mistake on Microsoft's part, having the two programs conflict.&nbsp; They need to realize many (or most) users of Windows also use Office and Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Hello I have found that when setting up outlook express 2013 you need to go into account settings<br />
click on your account<br />
<br />
then click change now click more settings then click advanced.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the displayed box under delivery make sure you untick the box keep email on server.<br />
<br />
what seems to have happened is when i use outlook even my deleted mails are staying on the servers system which backs up and starts to block incoming emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email now works great</p>

</p><p>IP address conflict usually occurs after defining a static IP address. To resolve, try following these steps:</p>
Run the Network troubleshooter
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>, and then select
<strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn’t fix your connection problem, try these things:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Reset the TCP/IP stack</li><li>Release the IP address</li><li>Renew the IP address</li><li>Flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Run these networking commands in Command Prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Command prompt</strong>,&nbsp;press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>netsh int ip reset</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>ipconfig /release</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>ipconfig /renew</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>

<p>We recently installed a SMART Board at a clients site. &nbsp;End users use a Stylus pen with the SMART Board. &nbsp;When using Windows Ink Workspace and more specifically Sketchpad or Screen Sketch the toolbar is located at the top right of the screen (see above).
 &nbsp;Some of the shorter users have a hard time reaching the toolbar. &nbsp;Is there a way to move the toolbar to the left of right vertically or to the bottom horizontally? &nbsp;Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Bonnie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Change the battery, change the USB port, restart PC, try in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows.
<br />
<br />Go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Mouse Device, then Driver tab, then Roll back button if available.  If not choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />If the problem is with Windows and not the mouse, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            OK. Forgot to mention that PC is Surface Pro 4. When running Defrag in the past few months since I bought the computer, it often says that C: drive needs defragging. should I not bother with that?

            <p>OK. The message was at least sent, so the original error ('<em>Sender address rejected</em>') has been cleared by changing your settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did ask you to send a test message to yourself, i.e. to the same AOL address as you're sending from. That way, we test the settings for both incoming and outgoing mail. You seem to have sent the message to a Hotmail address, which bounced the message because
 your AOL address is apparently not on your Hotmail safe senders list. Please compose a
<em>new</em> test message with a unique subject and use the AOL account to send it to the same address, then post any new error message in your reply.</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bbfa4126-d754-40a9-886e-155080ff2936">
sharownalee,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not being able to respond sooner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are encountering issues sending emails from your AOL account using Windows Live Mail. Like what
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f56d9012-0474-4f54-b2f6-e10490146e0b">
¡Firedog</a> suggested, you can try sending an email message to the same AOL email address that you are using to send emails so we can test whether the account can send emails successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to ask if you also receive the same delivery failure messages when you try to send emails to other email addresses or does the issue only occur when you send an email to that particular Hotmail.com email address that you provided?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Original Title:Drive "G" and Drive "H" have disappeared on my 2007 Dell XPS 420 with 500 GB of hardrive space and 10 percent not used.Thank you all.</p>
<p>I attempted to create a "Contacts" folder for my husband's malfunctioning Motorola 345 (Consumer Cellular) non smartphone..because we were told to do so by Motorola while they attempted to fix my husband's cellphone. I hooked up a USB cord and download the
 software (which never showed up on my PC). My "G" and "H" drive disappeared and I am also losing several of my FLIP videos that are stored on my Flip folder. Should I take this to Best Buy or hire someone from Cragislist? I do not know how to get my two disk
 drives back and don't know where my videos have gone. Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Astitva,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above issue might occur if you have typed incorrect reset password or if caps lock function is enabled on typing the reset password while logging in into the user account on the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to login into online Microsoft account using the reset password?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if you have enabled caps lock option or typed incorrect reset password on logging in into the user profile?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if you are able to login into the user profile using <strong>
On-screen keyboard</strong>?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If haven’t tried, check if you are able to login into the user profile using the reset password on using the
<strong>On-screen keyboard</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> is located in the <strong>Ease of access</strong> center located at the bottom left corner of the lock screen.&nbsp;It acts as a temporary keyboard in-case your keyboard does not work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Follow the steps below to use on-screen keyboard at the login screen:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click on the <strong>Ease of access</strong> icon located on the bottom right corner of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>on-screen keyboard</strong> option and type the password.</span></li><li><span>After typing, click on the icon located next to the password entry box and check if you have typed the correct password.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>Enter </strong>and check if you are able to login into the user profile.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> After logging in, <strong>update</strong> the
<strong>keyboard drivers</strong> manually from <strong>Device manager</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X </strong>keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>Keyboards</strong>, right click on the keyboard driver and select
<strong>Update this software</strong> from the context menu to update keyboard drivers.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand </span><strong><span>Mice and other pointing devices</span></strong><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> right click on the mouse driver and select

    <title>Problem connecting Windows 7 64-bit laptop to HP deskjet 5550 printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem connecting Windows 7 64-bit laptop to HP deskjet 5550 printer via wireless</h2>
                    I have an XP desktop with an HP deskjet 5550 printer attached and installed. I just bought an Asus laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, and can't get the laptop to connect to the printer (via wireless). I can share drives and access desktop PC folders
 from the laptop. The printer is shared from the XP machine. <br />
<br />
Here's what I've done: Control Panel - View Devices and Printers, click Add a Printer. In the dialog, click Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer. The printer is found (\\desktopPC\hp deskjet). Then I click Next, get the Connecting to hp deskjet dialog,
 which says, "Checking windows update. This might take a while..." Then the text changes to "Downloading the driver. This might take a while..." Then another dialog pops up, which says "No driver found" and "Windows can't find a driver for hp deskjet 5550 series
 on the network. To locate one manually, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel and consult your network administrator or the printer manufacturer's website."
<br />
<br />
If I click OK and try c:\windows\inf, it says it can't find a suitable driver. HP's site says a basic driver for this series should be built-in. Any ideas anyone?

<p>Problem fixed: I finally got it working; here's what I did:</p>
<p>1. Renamed the shared printer (from "hp deskjet" to "hpdeskjet") on the desktop - just to make sure spaces weren't causing any problems.<br />
2. On the laptop, I went through the Add a Printer wizard, but selected the <em>local</em> (not network) printer option.<br />
3. When installing locally, I used \\<em>desktopname</em>\hpdeskjet as the location/name (where
<em>desktopname</em> is then name of the desktop machine that the printer is connected to).<br />
4. When it asked to select a driver, there were 3 choices, 2 from HP (ending with HPA), and 1 from Microsoft. I picked the Microsoft driver.<br />
<br />
That worked for me - just make sure it's the default printer on the user accounts on the laptop.</p>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t boot properly, won&#39;t recover, won&#39;t reset, won&#39;t repair, and I can&#39;t fix it through cmd, since the boot fails too early.</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I've had for some months, and it has made it impossible for my computer to install the latest Windows Security Update, which I think might be why some rather annoying bugs have appeared other than the boot (random keypresses (disconnecting
 keyboard doesn't change it), constant M1-clicks (disconnecting the mouse won't stop it)).<br />
</p>
<p>For some reason, if I boot through UEFI-fastware, the computer will actually boot, but I'm still unable to update Windows (which keeps reminding me every 30 minutes, thank you for that).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've looked up the error code and tried to fix this problem using about 20 different methods, but all has failed. Disconnecting hardware or changing boot settings and/or deactivating the software that starts at boot won't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single thing I do just leads me back to this screen.</p>

    <title>Fallout 4 Entry Screen Freezes&#47;Crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianleiken1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fallout 4  Entry Screen Freezes&#47;Crashes</h2>
                    <p>Playing on an Xbox X - Fallout 4 with mods. &nbsp;Game freezes and crashes on entry screen before I even have a chance to load or delete a saved game file. &nbsp;This tends to happen when I get a character to upper levels, over 75+. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the usual techniques to restart the game. &nbsp;Hard reboot, uninstall/reinstall game, delete account, then reinstall account. &nbsp;I've cleared the caches, but as soon as the game reloads from backup - the corrupted files freeze the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can play without mods, but I've finished the game on earlier play throughs and the mods are what enhance the experience and make the game different. &nbsp;Is there a list of mods that are known to corrupt games, or is there a mod I can download that sets
 the mods in the correct order? &nbsp; Finally, is there anyway to save the game, or will I have to delete the file completely and start over from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It might be one particular mod causing the issue, can you disable all of them and then bring them up in steps until you hit the one causing the crash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also be being caused by a combination of the mods in play.</p>

            <p>No, you can't pause it with exception if you are using Windows 8/8.1 and you are able to set your Internet connection as metered connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you source a speedy connection on July 29th or later and perform a one time download of the .ISO file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do I have the option of delaying the download? </strong></p>
<p>You can configure Windows Update the day before July 29th 2015&nbsp;to check for updates but let you decide when to install them to avoid having the upgrade download automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set your Internet connected as metered, Windows Update will not download the upgrade.

</p><p>In Windows 8/8.1, click the View Available Network icon in the system tray, then right click your Internet Connection and select the option to
<strong>Set as metered connection.</strong></p>

</p><p>If you don't want updates to be installed automatically, you can choose to be notified when updates apply to your computer instead. Then, you can download and install them yourself, or you can set Windows to automatically download updates, and then notify
 you so you can install them yourself. Here's how to change how Windows installs or notifies you about updates:</p>

Windows 10 is a 3.5 GB download, most metered connections do not support downloading such a large program. So what are you supposed to do if you want to take advantage of the free upgrade?

 upgrade, you can restore the hidden update.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">The two updates on Win7 Pro that you'll need to hide are:<br />
"Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2952664)"<br />
"Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro"</p>
<div style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">
<p>YMMV - but it should be very close to that.&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">smile emoticon</span></em></p>
<p>In my case I'm currently net-connected using 3G (super expensive download) - but I'm expecting to get a faster more reliable (and inexpensive in comparison) connection next week!</p>

<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />If you have a VPN enabled, disable it.

    <title>Teredo, UPNP and Ports NHL 17 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Teredo, UPNP and Ports NHL 17</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Xbox Forum,</p>
<p>I am at a loss. I have been playing NHL year after year with no problems and even had no problems until last week when all of a sudden I could no longer find any opponents. I figured it had to with my NAT settings so I went about opening up the required
 ports and had my NAT say open but still could not connect to anybody.</p>
<p>I did some further investigation and found that its says I am behind a CONE NAT which based on reading doesn't mean it wont work.
</p>
<p>I also kept finding that when my router is set to UPNP enabled port 3074 shows that it is now opened with the name Teredo.
</p>
<p>I don't know what to do and am wondering if anyone has any suggestions?</p>
<p>also to give the full amount of information I had it work at one point only to turn off my console and have it not work.
</p>
<p>Do I need UPNP enabled? What is Teredo and should it be opening Port 3074? </p>
<p>Here is another kicker other games I play I.e. Star Wars Battlefront allows me to play online.
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mat</p>

<h2>            Help, your pc&#47;device needs to be repaired &#40;0xc0000428&#41; windows 10</h2>
                    <p>hi I've had this problem for a long time where when windows try's to update it gets to 19% then fails to update and restarts. so in the process of trying to fix this i was going to restart in safe mode after using some thing in command prompt (don't remember
 what it was) to verify the system files, and it told me that some files we're corrupted. so when i went to restart it in safe mode, it tried to update, failed, and now when i try to turn it on i get the error and recovery page. At first it was the 0xc0000225
 error and after trying some fixes it changed to the 0xc0000428 error and says:</p>
<p>the operating system couldnt load because the digital signature of a file couldnt be verified.</p>
<p>file: \windows\system32\drivers\NSx64\1606000.08E\symefasi64.sys</p>
<p>error code 0xc0000428</p>
<p>i tried using the the recovery option after i booted from windows 10 installation media and it couldnt solve the problem. if anyone knows how i can reinstall windows or fix this please help.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

            If you have win 10 installation media just do a "clean" install, if after you do a clean install and you still have problems your install media may be bad you can download the Anniversary ISO and use that, your system will auto activate don't use a key.&nbsp;for
 the Windows 10 media creation tool&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CLICK HERE</a></strong>&nbsp; Just be sure you use the same version as what is on your system&nbsp; Pro or Home&nbsp; 32bit
