<h2>            Backgroundtaskhost frequently interupting full screen games  and movies - windows 10 Professional 15063.138</h2>
                    ever since I upgraded windows from 14393.1066 to 15063.138, a window will quickly open then close. I was only recently able to identify the process that was causing it, backgroundtaskhost.exe I don't know what this .exe does, but it is appearently a part
 of windows. when the windows opens and closes, I am usually in the middle of a fullscreen application. in the best case scenario, the application I use, will minimize. in the worst scenario, it will crash or I am unable to return to the application. but the
 constant interruptions are unacceptable. is this an issue that others are seeing as well? is there a fix on the way?

</p><p>in my experience chkdsk is not supposed to hog system memory like that. is that a bug? or is it simply operating as intended?</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 using the free upgrade, you should have a digital license instead of a product key. Digital license is an activation method in Windows 10 that doesn't require a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest using the Activation troubleshooter and try activating Windows 10 again. For your reference, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/20527/windows-10-activation-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to use the Activation troubleshooter. If the issue still persists, we recommend contacting our
 Answer Desk for further assistance with the activation. Click this <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to get in touch with Answer Desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature
 of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you

First month said that it needs activation by my organization.</p>
<p>Now Activate Windows logo at bottom right corner appears and in Windows Activation Settings I have this error: We can't activate Windows on this device as we can't connect to your organization's activation server. Make sure you're connected to your organization's
 network and try again. If you continue having problems with activation, contact your organization's support person. Error code: 0x8007232B</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>

<p>Hi TheSViper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might see this error if you entered a product key that doesn't match the edition of Windows on your device. To have a better understanding about this issue, I'd like to know which edition of Windows is currently installed on your computer.
<span>You can find this information by clicking the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Start&nbsp;</strong></span><span>button, type&nbsp;</span><span><strong>winver</strong></span><span>, and then press&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Enter</strong></span><span>.</span></p>

            Where can I find my digital licence? I bought a Dell Inspiron from Dell with 8.1 loaded and upgraded to Windows 10 when it was released with no problems.&nbsp; Then a couple of days ago a message appears bottom right of my screen "Activate Windows Go to settings
 to activate Windows". This has been impossible because I cannot find a digital license. Saying that I can activate Windows with a digital license is no use unless I can find it and input it. Perhaps microsoft could support this customer by providing me with
 it.

            I also have the same experience since the first week of Sept 2018. In the settings screen however I find that it has been activated. Then why this message appears repeatedly? Do I have to find the digital licence? If anyone you have an answer to my (our)
 problem kindly mail it to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. I trawled through pages on microsoft's windows help pages and found a reference to NeoSmart Technologies who provide a downloadable program that finds the activation key. Try that and hopefully it works for you. It didn't for me so I
 had to contact the helpdesk who were stumped at first but very clever and persistent. They solved it for me. Thanks Helpdesk staff!</p>

            What you see are profile folders, not user accounts. It happens once every so often that profile folders are duplicated. There is no reason for concern.

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what was wrong with the old HOSTS file? Syntax error perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>This can happen if the "localhost" entry is missing.</p>

            <p>Don't know..Possibly..Never got these errors until 1511 update..never ever got them in Win 8.1, but I will say It would appear to be the cause of my HP Officejet printer&nbsp; to go off line repeatedly subsequently which was very frustrating.</p>
<p>All I've got left now to resolve are 4 x 7031 at shutdown which it would appear is a microsoft issue..They don't appear to be effecting operation of computer in any way.</p>
<p>Oh, forgot to mention in the resolve above, also went in and cleared the cache as well.</p>

<p>Occasionally when i am playing my Xbox, i can hear a faint clicking sound coming from my Xbox. The sound doesn't bother me at all, but just the fact that the sound might be something &nbsp;broke inside the X box.</p>

    <title>Installed Japanese Language Pack, Rebooted, Now I can&#39;t Switch to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m a weiss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Japanese Language Pack, Rebooted, Now I can&#39;t Switch to English</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, I installed the Japanese language pack (as I had also done on Win 7 with no problems) on Windows 10 Pro. I do this so I have a few Japanese options that I sometimes need. On Windows 7, I could switch back and forth by clicking on the taskbar
 and selecting language. On Windows 10 Pro, I rebooted this morning and now the whole interface is in Japanese and I can go into language settings and click on English, reboot, but it still comes up in Japanese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a desperate measure, I deleted the Japanese language pack and rebooted, but I'm still in Japanese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply wanted to ADD the language, but not make it the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Japanese reading skills are not great, so reversing the process is quite difficult. How do I set English as default when it ignores my request? English is set at the top of the stack of languages, too.</p>

<br />
<br />Did you follow these steps for adding and switching languages?<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17188879-8bc3-4230-9d29-b7088f57fc16?upload=true" />

            Those were the exact steps. I kept English at the top of the stack though, and for some reason, the next time I rebooted, everything was in Japanese language. There seems not to be a way to install a language pack without making it the default?

<br />That is strange, I have done this many times and it works without issue.

<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try installing the language pack from that account.

<br />
<br />The problem is you device is not supported on Windows 8 or 10
<br />
<br />Support page:

<br />
<br />The driver you need is for your graphics - ATI Radeon X1250
<br />
<br />That driver does not seem to be supported at all, though you might fins a legacy driver for that on the AMD website

<p>Hi Owl1161,</p>
<p>Step1:-<br />
You may follow these steps to reduce the touchpad sensitivity on the computer:</p>
<p>1. Turn on the computer and log into Windows as normal. Open the "Start" menu and click on the option labeled "Control Panel."<br />
2. Double-click on the icon labeled "Mouse.". The "Mouse Properties" window will open. Navigate to the tab labeled "Device Settings." Click on the button labeled "Settings." A window labeled "Properties" will appear.<br />
3. Examine the left panel of the "Properties" window and expand the option labeled "Sensitivity." Click on the option labeled "Touch Sensitivity."<br />
4. Reduce the touch sensitivity setting by moving the slider to the right, towards the "Heavy Touch" label. Experiment with different levels of sensitivity until you find one suited to your needs.<br />
5. Click on the button labeled "OK" to close the "Properties" window; repeat with the "Mouse" control panel. Your new touchpad sensitivity settings are now saved.</p>
<p>You may also follow the steps below to temporarily disable the touchpad while typing on the computer:</p>
<p>Control panel --&gt; "Mouse" (window opens) --&gt; "Device Settings"(last tab) --&gt; "Settings" (bottom right button)(window opens) --&gt; "Tapping" (2nd item in list at the left) --&gt; Uncheck "Enable Tapping" box (top right section)</p>

If this doesn‚Äôt work, you need to get in touch with your manufacturer for the latest drivers.</p>
<p>Hope it helps<br />

<h2>            Printing in black and white</h2>
                    I am using the original Surface laptop and an Epson ET2750 all in one printer. &nbsp; I do not have the option to change color when printing.&nbsp; I can change paper and layout but no color options.&nbsp; My husband who is connected to this printer on cable is working
 fine and has all the options.&nbsp; I am wireless.

<p>You do not have the full Epson software driver suite installed and only the generic driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, uninstall the printer from your machine and then go to Epson's web site and download the "Software &amp; Drivers" for the Eco-Tank 2750.&nbsp; Install it and it will re-install the printer to your machine and you will have the full capabilities of the printer.&nbsp;
 The generic driver is for basic output only.</p>

<p>That is an RT model and you can only use the generic driver that it has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note, and I found this out a few years ago; ink jet printers with color - if you select to print in black only, the printer 'cheats' and does print in black but also puts a few droplets of color to enhance the black.&nbsp; So, you are going to use color
 whether you select to do so or not.</p>

<h2>            Unable to play streaming audio using Windows Media Player </h2>
                    
<p>Windows Media Player cannot connect to the server. The server name might not be correct, the server might not be available, or your proxy settings might not be correct.</p>
<p>I've been using Media Player to listen to streaming audio for some time, several different stations, then I get this message?</p>

<p><span>Hi tonyrrr,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Do you get any error code along with the error message you‚Äôve stated in your post?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Do you get the error message only with respect to a particular station or is the issue in general caused with all the streaming stations?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>To verify that your proxy settings are correct, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Open
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<strong>Organize</strong> and select <strong>Options</strong>.<br />
3. In the <strong>Options</strong> dialog box, on the <strong>Network</strong> tab, in the
<strong>Streaming</strong> <strong>proxy</strong> settings area, verify your settings. If you don't know what your proxy settings should be, select a protocol, click Configure, and then in the Configure Protocol dialog box, select either Autodetect proxy settings
 or Use proxy settings of the Web browser. (The latter setting is available for the HTTP protocol only.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Repeat the above steps for each protocol that is displayed in the Streaming proxy settings area.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases, this error can occur if the Player tries to receive the stream by using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), but for some reason it
 can't. You may be able to fix the error by turning off this option in the Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To turn off UDP streaming, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- &nbsp;Open
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>-
<span>&nbsp;</span>Click <strong>Organize</strong> and select <strong>Options</strong>.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>- &nbsp;In the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog box, on the <strong>Network</strong> tab, in the
<strong>Streaming</strong> <strong>protocols</strong> area, clear the UDP check box.</span></p>
</span></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally,&nbsp;let‚Äôs run the Windows Media Player (WMP) troubleshooter and check if that detects and fixes the issue. The troubleshooter makes sure
 Windows Media Player is correctly installed on your computer, and checks to see whether your Player Library is corrupted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on running WMP troubleshooter:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter</span></p>

    <title>Black Ops 4 - Option to Upgrade Edition&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eldjotunn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Ops 4 - Option to Upgrade Edition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before the release of Black Ops 4 for Xbox, I had noticed there was a select purchase to be able to upgrade from the Standard Edition to the Deluxe or Enhanced Editions in the store. I would have taken a picture but I had trusted it would have stay up on
 the store and I had the plan to pick up the Enhanced Edition sometime after release when I had more money free to use but after release of the game, I noticed the option was taken down or at least hidden. Can there be any way to bring this back? I know as
 far as myself, for someone whose primarily sticking to buying games digitally, I can't always just throw down like a full hundred something dollars at a single game at one time. Having the option to upgrade whenever like on Blizzard and only pay the difference
 is awesome and I'd be so willing to do that but I just can't see myself paying for the game again plus extra just to pick up some special edition exclusives. Even with the collector that I am and I like to have all the things for the games that I like, I can't
 see throwing so much extra money to a game I already own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, can this be available for all games with seperate editions? I would love to be able to preorder and pick up the special editions whenever I can but at the risk of repeating myself, it's hard just being able to just flat out go on a large
 purchase while being an adult and having other bills.</p>

            Hi, I'm not sure if the option to upgrade to a different edition is available anymore. However, you can purchase the Black Ops Pass separately, which gives you access to a lot of things that the higher editions have access to. You can buy the Black Ops
 Pass here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-black-ops-pass/bqv9xcx5h9v9?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-black-ops-pass/bqv9xcx5h9v9?activetab=pivot:overviewtab</a>&nbsp;Feel
 free to reach out to Xbox Support directly to inquire about upgrading to other editions though!

<p>Reema,</p>
<p>There are multiple solutions here and you haven't specified which solution you've already tried and didn't work. Please review the posts here and specify which solutions didn't work for your issue.</p>
<p>Also, you mention that you tried "installing the wireless network" in Safe Mode. Does this mean that you were able to connect in Safe Mode, but not within regular Windows? If so, you should try a clean boot to pinpoint the item or service causing the error:</p>

            <p>How did you send your deposit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you paid through some computer means; if you mailed cash, then you should give the physical address information to the police.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used pretty much any computer means other than Bitcoin (or similar "electronic currency"), complain to the organization that effected the transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you used a credit card, call the credit card company and ask for its fraud department.</p>
<p>

            <p>It seems very odd that the police would ask you to help them, they have their own mechanisms to trace any contact details you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can search for the owner of an IP Address but the information may be of limited value. If for example it belongs to an ISP the users IP will probably change at regular intervals. You would need to find who had that IP at a specific time and date, something
 the ISP should have logged&nbsp;but would not give to you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If they thought it warranted it the police&nbsp;can raise an order for this information to be released under the "snoopers charter" regulations but the rules are quite strict about how and why they can do so. Something as "simple" as this would be very easy to
 get an anonymous IP such as through an internet caf√©.</p>

            <p>You should always call the bank 1st, in certain circumstances they can hold the payment but the sooner the better. Again they could trace the payment destination but would only do so on instruction however once withdrawn as cash it is lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality this is not a Microsoft issue and you need to seek advice elsewhere.</p>

            <p>You've discovered one very large disadvantage of using a debit card rather than a credit card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use a debit card, your funds are accessed immediately, and once payment has been made, your funds are gone.&nbsp; If you call the bank promptly, it will begin investigation, but there is no guarantee that your funds will be recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use a credit card (charge card), the bank pays out of its own funds and charges you interest on the loan until you pay it back.&nbsp; Generally, there is no interest charge if you pay the full amount within the first month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the U.S., credit card users can dispute unauthorized purchases or purchases of goods that are damaged or lost during shipping. Charges to a debit card, however, be reversed unless the merchant is willing to do so.&nbsp; In addition, debit card victims don't
 get their refund until due process has been completed.&nbsp; Credit card holders, on the other hand, are not assessed the fraudulent charges made in their names. &nbsp; While some credit and debit card providers offer zero-liability protection to their customers, the
 law is much more forgiving for credit card holders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the law is in the U.K., but you are undoubtedly long past any time limit with respect to your debit card payment.&nbsp; You should find out what consumer protections are available if you use a credit card rather than a debit card and consider
 getting a credit card for your future protection. </p>

<h2>            Sort Order Of The Side Bar In Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>High,</p>
<p>I work on a Windows 10 Home (64bit) laptop and want to change the order of the Explorer side bar in my own manner.</p>
<p>Depending on my searching results I got a first helpfull solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ramesh explained that for <strong>Libraries </strong>under the following Key <strong>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{031E4825-7B94-4dc3-B131-E946B44C8DD5}</strong></p>
<p>the dword <strong>SortOrderIndex </strong>is responsible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings-winpc/moving-libraries-folder-in-windows-10/3817114e-07ac-4bf6-acdc-db88db0c806c</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, what is in general the logic of managing the sort order of the other items?</p>
<p>Is there any?</p>
<p>May be there are other keys for each other item?</p>
<p>May be there exists a (hex) table of possible combinations?</p>

<p>1. Please try to update the xbox app by going to Start &gt; Microsoft Store &gt; click the 3 dots icon at the top right &gt; My Library &gt; see if there is an arrow beside the xbox app. If you don't see the xbox app click "Show all" on the right to see them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Please click Start, type "Apps &amp; features" select that, Find "Xbox" and click it, Click "Advanced Options", Click "Reset" you see there. Restart the app and try to sign in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please click Start &gt; type Troubleshoot and click it &gt; go to the bottom and click Troubleshoot Windows Store Apps &gt; see if it fixes any problems for the xbox app or shows an error that wasn't fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Please press the Win+R keys to open the Run dialog. Type WSReset.exe and click on OK. The Store and a command prompt will now open without any message. The command prompt will automatically close when the store cache has been reset. Try the app after
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Go to the Windows Store and find Xbox (beta) and download that and see if that app works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other solutions involve making sure windows updates are up to date and resetting the whole windows store via a powershell command.</p>

<p>Hi Scotty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Android or iOS? Go ahead and check either app store and see if there is the Xbox (beta) app and see if it lets you sign in from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check to see if you can correctly sign in to account.xbox.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your phone settings, go to your App settings and make sure data sharing is allowed with the Xbox app.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro, but can&#39;t make it work.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro and, as expected, lost my Virtual XP Mode. Installed Hyper-V, but can't activate it or make it work. When I purchased W7U, I got the license and program to install Virtual XP Mode. It was installed and
 operated well. (I worked in Virtual XP Mode off-line, as I know it is not supported by security updates, other than malicious software removal, any longer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Hyper-V in Windows 10 Pro a free installation, or does it require a separate purchase and activation code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it not a separate purchase, I need some help making it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(On a separate topic, is it possible that my OS usage went from 113GB to 75GB when I converted to Windows 10 Pro? Seems excessive, but most of my programs still are installed and working.)</p>

                    If I click fix windows, it changes the screen for a moment and then loads back with the same options. Choosing continue normally, the computer just restarts and does the same thing. I have done the Disable Driver Signature Enforcement, it works to get
 me on the computer, but if I shut down the computer, when I turn it back on, it's the same thing all over again. So to be able to get on, I have to Disable Driver Signature Enforcement. I can't use any other setting including safe mode.. Anyone know how to
 help?

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
