    <title>Extension Cable - Surface - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Extension Cable - Surface</h2>
                    <p>Would like to make a suggestion for an extension cable for the Surface computers, specifically Surface 4 and Surface Book. This would extend the cable between the dock and the computer itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One male and one female with magnetic connection on each end would be ideal in 3 foot and possibly 6 foot lengths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I use my Surface Book on an easel with the screen folded back as a second monitor, attached to the Surface Dock on my desk. Occasionally I like to use One Note on the the Surface Book screen while also working on the external monitor. Being able
 to take the screen and place it on my desk for writing in One Note would be great. I can do that now, but placement of the Surface Dock is limited since it must be placed within about a foot or so of the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possible use cases:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being able to locate the Surface Dock further away from my Surface Book such as under a monitor or on a shelf while also being able to keep Surface Pro/Book in a good position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use of an articulating arm/monitor holder to hold the Surface Pro/Book that I can move around and position. Being able to run the cable down the articulating arm to a Surface Dock on the desk would keep the cable from pulling on the Dock and allow greater
 movement.<br />
</p>
<p>When doing presentations, being able to take the Surface Pro/Book in hand, but connected via a cable to a Surface Dock on a Desk or podium that can then connect to external monitors/projectors and also connected to required USB devices that might be needed
 during a presentation (Hard Drives, cameras, etc.) This would also provide power to the device during longer presentations, even when using the clipboard function of the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some thoughts, and something that should be pretty easy to do!</p>

            <p>We want to use the Surfaces on our conference tables without running a bunch of cables across the table. We want to mount the dock under the table with a single cable coming through to connect the surface to the dock. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would leave the dock wired in, so that we could make the one connection to be up and running, using the projector, wired lan, and surround sound.&nbsp;We have found that using the Surfaces wirelessly provides less than optimal performance, so we only use them
 wired in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be so nice and clean looking on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, with the 18" cable, we can't do that, and would have to run a bunch of cables across.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I actually like this idea as well, and it gives me another thought. For conferences/business use, a surface dock version with multiple cables, able to support multiple Surface computers. Put a dock under a table and run the cables up to connect for users.<br />
<br />
As a plus, giving the ability of the dock to provide network access to multiple computers, Switchable video type access (Similar to a KVM switch) being able to cycle each computer to a single connected monitor or cable.<br />
<br />
Shared USB access would be nice too, but not sure this would be easy to implement.</p>

            I'm in the same boat. The position I want my Surface Book in with the dock hidden means I have to stretch the cable and I fear it may mess it up soon.

            I have three docs - one on my desk that my surface pro 3 slides into and two of the newer ones that attach where the power cable usually goes. The two newer ones are in my bedroom and living room and I use both for watching Netflix, YouTube, etc. while
 also using my computer. I have my displays configured in windows one above the other and It's nice to be able to seamlessly transition from clicking around on Facebook or Amazon to interacting with whatever show I'm watching by just moving the mouse up to
 the TV.<br />
<br />
It would be great to not have the main dock with all the cords sitting on my bed/couch and just a longer cord that runs from the dock (placed on a self or something) over to my surface.

<p>I too have this need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Surface Book on my lap, but the dock is over on my left, and the cable just isn't long enough to reach the right side of the Surface Book. I've put the dock as close to the sofa as possible and it is about a foot too short. I'd prefer to have the
 dock under the side table, so it isn't seen with all the cables. When I really need to connect it, I end up balancing the Surface Book on the arm of the sofa (not very safe!). So yes please, and extension lead with female, to male magnetic connections would
 be fantastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please make it happen.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Device Will Not Uninstall, Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth Device Will Not Uninstall, Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>PC: Dell Precision M3800</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background Information:</p>
<p>I installed a MPOW Bluetooth headset (FreeGo) and the unit worked fine for several days. &nbsp;I would turn on the headset and it would connect to the laptop, no problems. &nbsp;I used the headset on my PC for MS &nbsp;Lync meetings. &nbsp;About six days after the initial installation
 I tried to use the headset for a MS Lync meeting and I was hearing a lot of digitized noise (similar in nature to the sounds of the old dial up modems). &nbsp;I disconnected and reconnected a few times and even rebooted the computer to no avail. &nbsp;Lastly, I tried
 to uninstall the device, I figured I would then re-install the device and see if it took care of the problem but the unit would not uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the unit will not permanently uninstall. &nbsp;I go through the uninstall process and the unit goes away from the Bluetooth and devices setup screen, the device manager tree and the devices and printers folder on the control panel but, when I turn Bluetooth
 off and then on again on the PC the MPOW device reappears but does not connect or function - the MPOW Bluetooth headset is powered off during this process. &nbsp;The device offers several hardware functions/device types: Bluetooth, HID, hands-free sound, hands-free
 audio and call control, and Stereo sound. &nbsp;All the hardware functions still reappear on the hardware tab. &nbsp;All the device drivers are MS drivers version 6.3.9....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get the device to connect nor can I get it to uninstall - please help. &nbsp;I've read the Bluetooth device support posting but none of them seem to help or address this specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to remove the MPOW device from Windows' memory? &nbsp;I'm contemplating going through the Windows registry and searching for the hardware ID or something along those lines and deleting all the entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Info:</p>
<p>There were no software or drivers installed on the PC for the headset, nor does the manufacture offer any device drivers. &nbsp;I continue to use the headset with my mobile phone and the unit works fine. &nbsp;I'm also able to connect my mobile phone to the
 PC via Bluetooth and it functions fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I see the avatar for a user, a physical phone and a group. I just don't know what this avatar represents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am troubleshooting an issue and this is the only thing that stands out right now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Sergei_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contact card appears as a regular contact, but my problem is that this user does not exist in the environment. (I.e. Active Directory, Skype or Exchange Online)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is assigned 2 numbers that belong to other users, so I cannot track it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking that it was a user's personal contact that somehow got published, or something similar.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Surface RT stuck in sleep mode permanently</h2>
                    I purchased my RT one week ago. I haven't updated Windows from what was on it when I bought it. I cannot get the screen to light up anymore. If I touch the windows button I can feel a vibration, so I know its on. Do I take it back to the store tomorrow
 and swap for an Ipad? Can this be fixed by me?

            <p>Hold the power button for 10-20 seconds until it powers off (you be able to tell because the Windows button won't vibrate). Now plug it in, while holding the down volume rocker press the power button and the Surface Logo should appear (it may take a couple
 seconds)&nbsp;and it should boot normally.</p>

    <title>Gamecontroller swapped Z - X axis problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gamecontroller swapped Z - X axis problem</h2>
                    I recently wanted to connect my USB steering wheel to my Windows 7 64 bit pc and encountered a rather weird problem: the computer swaps the Z and X axis of the wheel. As a result, whenever I let go of the gaspedal, I brake and pressing down the brake doesn't
 work at all. Is there any way in which I can tell Windows to combine the axis? Or will Microsoft add this simple feature (that was present in XP) in a later patch? It's really annoying, and I'm not willing to put Windows 7 in test-mode so PPJoy will run.

<p><span>Also check the game controller settings, check if the settings have been changed.</span></p>

    <title>Setting up onedrive on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alyssabf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up onedrive on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up OneDrive a new Windows 10 PC, and finding it much less intuitive than I think it should be.&nbsp; I want to everything on my PC sync'd to OneDrive, and I want everything on OneDrive sync'd to PC (e.g..&nbsp; pictures from camera sync'd to onedrive
 and then sync'd to my PC).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Fundamental thing I do not understand - in the above scenario, is Windows storing 2 copies of my documents on My PC&nbsp; - one within OneDrive folder and another in This PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Somehow I have managed for My MUsic folder in OneDrive to not be accessible, unless I am an Admin on my PC ( which of course a is another question of why it is not intuitive to operate as a admin within file explorer - ugh!!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The different icon is
 clue, but not enough for me to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><ol>
<li>Open the properties of the main user profile folder where the files are located (such as Documents, Pictures, etc).

                    <p>It's 2018.... why the heck can't my Xbox One save multiple WIFI passwords??? My laptop that I'm currently using to write this message on is windows 10 and it can, so why not Xbox One?? Some of us take our system places and it's annoying to constantly re entering passwords. </p><p><br /></p><p>Is there any reason for this?? or is Microsoft just being lazy here or what??? I've never heard of a reason why so if anyone can shed some light on this, my friends and I would LOVE to know. </p>

 </blockquote> <p><br /></p><p>So you have one reason and ok sure, i get that, but my Microsoft, windows based desktop computer isn't really designed to be taken out and about and it can save multiple WIFI passwords. There is ZERO reason why in 2018 my xbox one can't save more then one. </p><p><br /></p><p>Yes i agree that it doesn't take long to impute a other WIFI password, but that's not the point. Microsoft is all about connivance. look at all the small little features that has been added to xbox one since it came out. I could easily argue that saving more then one WIFI password is bigger then a lot of those even. I'm not the first person to ask for this feature, look around. Trust me, a lot of people want this.</p>

            <p>Microsoft does not run the full Windows 10 version operating system for PC's, on Xbox One. Xbox One runs a dumbed down version of Windows 10. Each platform may need it's own special OS. For instance, the OS on your Xbox One can't multitask anywhere near as good as the OS version on your PC - they even took away the Snap feature on Xbox One, which allowed you to display two windows (one large, say a game, and one small, say YouTube or Netflix). Yes Microsoft is the largest software company in the world! They just have a habit of wanting to implement their own ideas first. Just take a look at the state that Xbox One launch at, in 2013 - no voice messaging, couldn't change dash background, no external HDD support. </p><p><br /></p><p>It's just like my new Sony KD43X8000E 4K HDR TV (2017 model from Sony). It has Android 7.0 but the version is a dumbed down version compared to my Samsung S8 and PC. It's also the same with Cortana AI between Xbox One and Windows smartphone brands like Nokia. Xbox One

<p>These excuses are some of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever read. My cellphone, tablet, Kindle, desktop, laptop, Echo, and Apple TV all remember my wifi passwords. Saving network info is an absurdly easy thing to program and nobody else has trouble doing
 it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I completely agree with you. It is the only electronic device that I use and transport often that doesnt have such feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have an after school club that pays me per kid, per hour. Basically the more kids I have, the more I make an hour. I own 6 Xbox Ones for that reason. It is such a hassle to have iron out other issues (bought extra HDMIs and power cords to only have to
 transport the consoles themselves) but the metwork password issue remains.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I right click the Network Adapter all I can do is scan for hardware changes or look at Properties. Looking at properties only shows me an icon with description Network Adapters. I can't do anything with it beyond that.</p>

            <p>I had this problem but I found this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/after-upgrading-to-windows-10-internet-only-works/6ee391e0-ab6c-4471-879c-83279eed21ee?page=1">
article</a>&nbsp;which gave the following instructions to fix this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) in Administrator mode (search for cmd.exe and then right click the&nbsp;icon&nbsp;to see run in Administrator mode)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Next enter the following commands in command prompt window:</p>
<p>First line enter "netsh winsock reset"<br />
The line should look like this &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\system32&gt;netsh winsock reset</p>
<div>Then press enter</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Second line enter "netsh int ip reset"<br />
It should look like this &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\system32&gt;netsh int ip reset</p>
<div>Then press enter</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>After that just restart the computer and you should be all fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem prevented my networking to start in safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Visual Studio 2015 Professional failed to start with this problem as well.&nbsp; Even Microsoft support could not start a remote session to my PC to diagnose.&nbsp; I found the article by myself, ran
 the commands, rebooted.&nbsp; You may have to turn off your antivirus (I uninstalled my Norton before I ran the commands).&nbsp; Try it without messing with the AV programs and if it fails, uninstall the AV and try again.&nbsp; The article listed also has other steps to
 follow if these commands don't fix it for you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the steps above and rebooting, my Visual Studio 2015 Professional is able to start, but the announcements on the Start page are not loading nor does my IE explorer connect to the internet.&nbsp; I will still have to see how to fix my IE and I plan
 to use the other recommendations in that article when I have time tonight.</p>

            Tried the solution above. Still can't access safe mode &amp; networking. I can get to safe mode but no internet access. Saw somewhere that you have to uninstall your Antivirus software, reluctant to do that. Is there anything else I can try?

            <p>I tried my pc in safe mode with internet.&nbsp; It was able to connect to the internet using a wired connection to my home network.&nbsp; It did not work with the wireless adapter.&nbsp; When I reboot normally to any account, both adapters work.&nbsp; So this may be a limitation
 of the safe mode internet connection.&nbsp; This is what Microsoft support tried to get me to do to remote into my pc before I reset the tcp/ip stack as noted above.&nbsp; They failed to get a connection when it was wireless so then they told me to use a wired connection.&nbsp;
 Even when it was a wired connection they were not able to connect.&nbsp; This now works in safe mode after I did the tcp/ip stack reset&nbsp;above using a wired connection.&nbsp; Also I did perform an update to the drivers of my wireless adapter before I reset the tcp/ip
 stack and that did not get me connected.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As to removing your AV, windows defender will take over as your default AV.&nbsp; It is built in.&nbsp; I did not disable defender at any time.&nbsp; I just wanted Norton AV out of the way since it has a bad habit of blocking internet connections when you go to anywhere
 else other than your home network and then go back home.&nbsp; The only way to fix that is to uninstall and reinstall Norton at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a gotcha with Internet Explorer on windows 10 is that you have to run it as an administrator.&nbsp; Right click the icon and pick run as administrator.&nbsp; This is on any account except the&nbsp; safe mode account.&nbsp; I am still trying to fix that since other apps
 that connect to the internet now needs to be run as administrator to connect (Visual Studio 2015).</p>

    <title>Dedicated Video Memory on Intel HD 530 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristers09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dedicated Video Memory on Intel HD 530</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I just got my new pc with Intel i5 6500 processor, wich has integrated Intel HD Graphics 530. In proporties, It shows that total aviable graphics memory is 8012 MB, but dedicated video memory is only 128 MB. I know that it is possible to increase it,
 but I couldn't find an option for that in BIOS. I have 16 GB of RAM, so it should be possible. &nbsp;My old laptop had this option. Then I found out, that this iGPU uses as much memory as it needs. But, after taking a look at my PC's graphics performance, I decided
 that it doesn't. I couldn't play GTA 4 because it showed that I have only 128 MB video memory aviable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I need ANY help at this problem. The best help would actually be telling how to increase Dedicated Video Memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ASUS Z170-E motherboard,</p>
<p>16 GB RAM;</p>
<p>Intel i5 6500 with Intel HD Graphics 530.</p>

<h2>            Bluescreen Error when open temporary files&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed windows 10 about a month ago. Things were working fine until I faced the bluescreen error. Whenever I try to open temporary internet files to remove them, the bluescreen error occurs. I wasn't facing this error before, I used to delete temporary
 files all the time, but now whenever I open "%temp%" from cmd, the bluescreen error occurs. I tried to restart my laptop and all but still having this issue. I also tried to update my SATA driver as told by the microsoft support team in some other bluescreen
 error thread here, but it didn't work for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see requests&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Similar to countless of other people using Skype, why can't I see requests? &nbsp;I am using the newest version on both Mac laptop, iPad, iPhone, and a windows 10 thing. &nbsp;I have also uninstalled and installed the "classic" version. &nbsp;Same response. &nbsp;A friend has
 sent 10 requests and I cannot see any of them. &nbsp;Same friend has sent several "waves" and I can't see them either. &nbsp;The friend can find me through Skype, but I can not find that friend. &nbsp;I confirmed I am using the correct account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the solution for this? &nbsp;I do not need a hand wave and a generic answer.</p>

<h2>            Connection-specific DNS Suffix Search List &#58; mshome.net</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Installed Vista SP2 yesterday. &nbsp;Today I can't resolve host names unless I use their FQDN. &nbsp;That is, in TCP/IP Settings for my NIC I have the following options set:</p>
<p><strong>Append primary and connection specific DNS suffixes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Append Parent Suffixes of the primary DNS suffix</strong></p>
<p>And in DNS suffix for this connection I have <strong>core.myexampledomain.com</strong></p>
<p>I can no longer ping <strong>htpc</strong> instead I now have to ping <strong>
htpc.core.myexampledomain.com</strong></p>
<p>In the ipconfig output, it shows a connection specific <strong>DNS Suffix Search List</strong> of
<strong>mshome.net</strong> for my LAN connection instead of <strong>core.myexampledomain.com</strong> as it should be.</p>
<p>I can work around it by using the option <strong>Append these DNS suffixes (in order)</strong> and listing:</p>
<p><strong>core.myexampledomain.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>myexampledomain.com</strong></p>
<p>Where is Vista getting mshome.net from for this connection?</p>
<p>I have LAN 2 connections, one is for a second NIC and is unplugged. &nbsp;They share DNS settings, that is if I change one, the other is affected, so the setting is not coming from the other NIC configuration.</p>

<p>Sadly I just got a ____ off response from Microsoft Support when I logged this issue. &nbsp;This is infuriating as I took the time to describe the issue, and to run the data collection tools ... to have the call closed with an off my desk response. &nbsp;Why should
 I ring support and have to go through describing the issue all over again? &nbsp;What was the point of running the data collection tools?</p>
<p>Thankyou MS or more specifically&nbsp;<strong><span>RESHMA CHITRA<span>&nbsp;<span>for nothing.</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From where did you download the Microsoft Expression Web file?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may check the default location:<br />
On a 32bit - <br />
<b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Expression\Web 4\ExpressionWeb.exe</b><br />
<br />
</span><span>On a 64bit computer - <br />
<b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Expression\Web 4\ExpressionWeb.exe</b></span></p>

            I checked both of those link areas and it is not listed there.&nbsp; I installed the program from my registered CD that I purchased earlier.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install the program again.&nbsp;&nbsp;When installling the program prompts you to browse the location and install it. &nbsp;You may choose Desktop as the saving location.&nbsp; Check if that helps.</p>
