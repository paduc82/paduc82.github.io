<p><span>Hi delsey30
</span><span><span>,<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</span></p>
<p><span>When do you get this error, is it on startup or when you were working on something?</span></p>
<p><span>ESAdvRemIntegrator is a service for a HP program. The process which runs in the background for this service is RemEngine.exe. It is an application from HP
 which has stopped working. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the application and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>As the name of the process says RemEngine.exe, I think it is a reminder engine. If have subscribed to something from HP and its trying to remind you whenever
 you start the computer. The best suggestion would be reinstall the Hp software or uninstall it completely if you do not use it.</span></p>
<p><span>If you still have issue I suggest you to contact HP support they should know about this process. You can contact HP at

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro Update &#40;and check&#41; fails with 80072efd</h2>
                    <br />
This machine was doing updates without a hitch up until 3 weeks ago when this problem developed.&nbsp; I've read more Vista fix pages on this issue (none of which were helpful) but found no solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have automatic updates set to download and notify settings
 if that matters and when I start up the update widget indicates that there are updates and I click on the download updates button and it says it has download ~49.3 MB then pops up the update fail with this error.&nbsp; If I try a manual check for updates it results
 in this error as well.&nbsp; It persists through reboots, I've tried stop/start of bits and wuauserv, tried a reload of the dll's per the Vista instructions (not all of which apparently apply to W7) so, what next?<br />

            <p>Yes, you can use the same product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no in place upgrade path from from Windows 7 64 bit to 32 bit. This means you will need to backup whatever personal files you have accumulated since you started using your Windows 7 64 bit PC to an external hard disk or burn them to a blank DVD.
 You cannot use Windows Easy Transfer program when migrating from 64 to 32 bit, <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
it is not backward compatible</a> with the older architecture. This means, you will need to copy and paste files into a folder on an external hard disk or thumb drive. You need to gather all those application and driver installation disks and prepare to reinstall
 all of them. You can learn more in our Notebooks.com article about how to reinstall Windows
<strong>here </strong></p>
<p><em>Obtaining 32 bit Installation media</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If your computer came with Windows 7 64 bit preinstalled, then you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer about obtaining a alternate recovery Windows 7 32 bit disk set to reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. The manufacturer might charge
 a small shipping and handling fee.</li><li>Some manufacturers will include the ability to choose either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 at installation time. This will require that you boot into the Recovery Environment, most manufacturers require that you press the F11 Function Key when you start your computer.
 Please consult the documentation that came with your computer about how to reinstall Windows 7.</li><li>If you bought a retail box license (upgrade or full version) then you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs included in the box.</li><li>If purchased a digital download of Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store, then you will need to go to the Microsoft Store website (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com</a>), log in with your store account, select Download Options
 and select Windows 7 32 bit and proceed to download.</li><li>If you have an Anytime Upgrade license, you will need first reinstall the base Windows 7 32 bit license, activate it then do the Anytime Upgrade to the particular edition and then reactivate again.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Starting the Installation</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d511%26amp%3bh%3d369" /></a></p>
<p>Boot to the Windows 7 64 bit desktop, insert your Windows 7 32 bit DVD, click <strong>
Run setup.exe </strong>when the Auto Play dialog appears. <em>If you want, you can also boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD and also do a custom install. Its just that, itâ€™s a bit more elegant when you simply boot to the desktop and start the installation from
 there. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d386%26amp%3bh%3d290" /></a></p>
<p>Click Yes when the User Account Control window appears</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d505%26amp%3bh%3d360" /></a></p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d504%26amp%3bh%3d350" /></a></p>
<p>Unlike the Windows 7 64 bit disk, you can start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit because the Setup program in Windows 7 32 bit is a full 32 bit application.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d499%26amp%3bh%3d349" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-6_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d498%26amp%3bh%3d348" /></a></p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-6a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-6a_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d498%26amp%3bh%3d365" /></a></p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use
 your previous version of Windows. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-7_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d347" /></a></p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-8_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d351" /></a></p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers. Persons running Windows Vista 64 bit, can also use this method when contemplating whether they should upgrade to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. If you decide to go the other way around by migrating from Windows 7 32 bit to 64 bit, the same principles apply
 with some exceptions. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to backup your personal files and settings and you will need to boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD to start the installation.</p>

<h2>            WAN Miniport &#40;IP&#41;  The system cannot find the file specified&#8221; while trying to install WAN miniport driver</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title:&nbsp; <span>WAN Miniport </span></p>
<p>I have Windows Vista Home Basic Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I also have dial up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time when I dial the local access number I get error 678 the remote computer did not respond.&nbsp; I am an ISP tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally I reinstalled my modem after&nbsp;unsuccessful attempts
 at other local access numbers.&nbsp; &nbsp;After reinstalling my modem, my dial up works just fine, but I have to reinstall almost everytime I dial up.&nbsp; I have a Toshiba Software Modem manufactured by Agere.&nbsp; I also tried updating the modem&nbsp;and got one successful update,
 but still have problems with error 678.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, tried to update my Wan Miniport (IP) by having Windows search online (in the device manager under driver update)&nbsp;and it found software, but after trying to install it gave this message:</p>
<p>Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.&nbsp; WAN Miniport (IP)&nbsp; The system cannot find the file specified.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know the manufacturer of youor device, you can visit its website and check the
 support section for driver software.</p>
<p>Microsoft is the manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have researched and cannot find anything helpful on WAN Miniports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, there is no signs or errors on any of my devices in my device manager and according to Windows, everything is working properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whosoever responds, could you educate me on the differnet WAN Miniport network adapters because I know there are different kinds (IP, IPv6, L2TP, PPPOE, PPTP, SSTP); tell me what the others are used for because I tried to update them and got same error as
 the Wan Miniport (IP).</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Netzteil kaputt &#91;Translation&#58; Xbox one power supply broken&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, also meine Xbox One steckt zusammen mit meinem Fernseher und meiner Wii U in einer 3-fach Steckdose. Wenn ich nach dem spielen die Konsole ausschalte leuchtet das Netzteil wie gewohnt Orange. Wenn ich die Konsole aber nach ein paar Stunden wieder einschalten
 mÃ¶chte leuchtet das Netzteil kurz orange, dann kurz weiÃŸ und dann schaltet sich die Xbox und das Netzteil aus. Dann muss ich den Stecker rausziehen und ihn wieder rein, raus, rein, raus und so weiter damit es wieder funktioniert. Meistens muss ich dabei den
 TV und die Wii U auch ausstecken. Am Stecker liegt es aber nicht, da ich es in einer normalen Steckdose auch schon versucht habe, da war es dasselbe Problem. Hat noch jemand solche Probleme, oder kennt ihr eine LÃ¶sung, oder wisst ihr vielleicht woran das liegen
 kÃ¶nnte? &nbsp;<br />

<p>Was meinst du, dass du es in einer normalen Steckdose auch schon versucht hast? Also es ist mÃ¶glich, dass sich die GerÃ¤te in einem Mehrfachstecker gegenseitig stÃ¶ren, so dass z.B. das Netzteil der One deswegen nicht ordentlich funktioniert. Probier also
 bitte nochmal, die One direkt an eine eigene Dose anzustecken.</p>
<p>Wenn du jemanden Kennst, der ebensfalls eine One besitzt, dann bitte diesen, dir einmal sein Netzteil zu leihen und schaue, ob die One damit einwandfrei funktioniert. Es kÃ¶nnte ja auch an der One liegen.</p>
<p>Sollte sich dabei heruasstellen, dass entweder die One oder das NEtzteil kapuut sind, dann wende dich bitte an den telefonischen Support (Tel.: 0800 181 2968) oder geh nach
<a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myservice.xbox.com</a> und starte dort einen Reparaturauftrag.</p>

<p>What do you mean by having it tried in a "normal" power outlet? It is possible that devices plugged into the same multiple power outlet cause interferences between them, so the power supply of the one might be affected and is not working properly. Be advised
 to please check what happens if you plug the power supply directly into the wall's power outlet.</p>
<p>Do you have a friend who maybe owns a One, too? If so please ask &nbsp;him to borrow his power supply to check if your One is working properly with his supply. Could be a faulty One of course, too.</p>
<p>If you get to the result that wether the One or the power supply is faulty please contact the local support by phone or place a repair order at

<p>Du must dafÃ¼r Sorgen das deine XB1 den Strom direkt aus der Steckdose kriegt ohne Mehrfachstecker oder VerlÃ¤ngerungskabel.</p>
<p>Wenn ein Problem aufgetreten ist, trenne das Netzteil von der Steckdose und der XB1 warte 60sekunden bis zum nÃ¤chsten Versuch.</p>
<p>Stelle Sicher das das Kabel richtig gut eingesteckt ist und nicht wackelt.</p>
<p>Hatta anfangs auch Probleme bis ich sie direkt an der Wand eingesteckt habe.</p>
<p>Sonst wÃ¼rde Ich die XB reparieren lassen bzw. das Netzteil...</p>

<p>Many here have had the exact problem with various updates. Dont try reimage windows or fresh install as all here have tried and no result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience, try to leave your SP empty battery for 1 to 2 days and then turn it on again. It should work, some would work after a few hours completely empty battery, mine works after 3 days :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your keyboard work again, do the followings (these are my experiences only)</p>
<p>1. Disable Connected standby (google it)</p>
<p>2. In power options, replace sleep/hibernate with shutdown</p>
<p>3. Always shutdown your SP, never sleep/hibernate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.<br />

For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />

<br />
When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.</p>

<h2>            Win10 Folder Permissions</h2>
                    <p>Win10 Pro V10.0.16299 Build16299 64bit</p>
<p>This system has run 24/7 since 2014 I use a network backup up App, IDrive, this runs every night and has run without issue since setup</p>
<p>The system wasn't used during the Christmas holidays , I accessed the system on 2nd Jan and the backup ran on that date</p>
<p>On 3rd Jan the back up failed logs showed errors 'there is no permission to backup the folder'&nbsp; (6 folders)</p>
<p>My Document Folders are all re-directed to a D:\ location (A separate drive, and have always been so)</p>
<p>I checked permissions on the folders and they all had full permissions</p>
<p>Nothing has been added/changed on the system (other than office data docs) There was no Win10 update on on/around the failure date</p>
<p>I have created a completely new backup which fails with the same permissions error. The backup app has been uninstalled, all files/folders removed and then re-installed and a ne backup created, same errors.</p>
<p>I have spent nearly 1.5 hours in a remote session with the app builders and they cannot find any issues</p>
<p>My Acronis TI v2018 system Image continues to run/verify daily with no issues&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to properly isolate the issue with the error message "There is no permission to backup the folder", we would like to know if you were able to reset your security settings and permissions. If not, we suggest that you try resetting it, and check if
 the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks, I have re-set all win permissions on the relevant folders, (none of which were at fault) but I continue to 'no permission' errors with the backup program.</p>
<p>However since I have been both creating docs and editing docs that are in these locations it seems to me illogical that there could be any underlying win permissions issues.</p>
<p>This and some other facts found leads me to believe that the problem lies with the backup program itself and not win.</p>
<p>You can therefore ignore my original post and I will go back to the program maker.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk</p>
<p>Did you find a solution to this one. I have begun having similar issues after some days of Idrive usage. For the first time they asked me to reinstall a newer version. But problem continues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back up fails on MyDocument which is strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back up fails on another users folders. (I am able to open them from my account as I had allowed Windows to do so.)</p>
<p>
[ERROR] [04/14/2018 10:20:54] [[C:\Users<strong>\&lt;&lt;ME&gt;&gt;\</strong>My Documents\][There is no permission to backup the folder]]<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure if it was a Windows or IDRIVE issue. Its also possible that myissue is limited to these particular folders as I do not see these logs on others. Thanks.</p>

<p>I gave Idrive support remote access, they amended various permissions, after which the backup has run without issue.</p>
<p>I was somewhat perplexed as to why permissions had changed or caused the problem as nothing had been changed or added to the system</p>
<p>This is the second occasion I have had a 'permissions issue' with Idrive </p>
<p>I do not use any 'speed up my PC' type of utility</p>

<p>
For the last year I could not launch Skype on my Macbook Pro and got the message above. It worked fine on Windows through Parallels and on my iPhone as well.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Trying to launch the "Ask a Question" page of the Skype Community website Google Chrome error message gave me a clue to by-pass the problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I hope it works also for you, guys!</p>

<h3> braniel64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED&#34; and unable to boot to desktop on Windows 10 operating system</h2>
                    <p>My laptop recently has stopped working.</p>
<p>It turns on and everything, it just cannot boot up.</p>
<p>The loading screen pops up and everything, but it won't go to the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I power the laptop on, it goes on the loading screen, and stays like that for a good 5-8 minutes, then gets an error message that says</p>
<p>"Process1_Initialization_Failed"</p>
<p>Then it tries to go into System Recovery, but after "Loading Files" it goes into the loading screen, then transitions into a black screen. There are no options, just a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wait for an hour, and absolutely nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure nothing else is plugged in except for the Charger.</p>
<p>The laptop is a Lenovo Y51.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need anymore information, please ask. I really need this fixed soon.</p>

            <p>Hi Braniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are facing in accessing the operating system with blue screen errors on your device. Do not worry we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide us additional information to assist you better with this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any changes to the operating system that might have resulted in this?</li><li>Were you able to see any error code along with the error message of this issue?</li><li>Which is the current version of Windows 10 installed on your device?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most of the stop errors (also sometimes called blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. Errors that occur on a blue screen may be caused by a software problem or by a hardware
 problem. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are on the insider builds of Windows 10 operating system you may refer to the Microsoft help article below to rollback to the previous build and check if it helps.</p>

            Nothing was changed before this happened. It happens at boot up. After you acknowledge the error next comes another error that explorer.exe is not the right version for this machine. Is x86 or x64. The PC is running Windows 64 bit version

            If this isn't a laptop, open it up (unplugged of course) and you should be able to push the piece out from the inside of the case. If it's a laptop the same thing can be done it's just a lot more work to take apart.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            critical administrative event 41 windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have been having an issue with my system just simply shutting down without any warning almost as if a power outage occurred. No blue screen no notifications nothing. It has happened 4 times now while playing a game in particular. When the power goes out
 I cant turn the computer back on for about 2 minutes or so. I initially thought it was a cpu heating issue since i had a stock cooler, I changed it for an evo 212, but the same issue applies. Could it possibly be the PSU, even though it powers the computer
 99% of the time and fan seems to be working fine? I went back into the windows event viewer and I have a link of the past week of errors that have been occuring, I just dont know what they mean. any help?<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=42B9E1D1DBB4DB7C%21104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=42B9E1D1DBB4DB7C%21104</a></p>

<p>temperatures doesnt reach more than 58 degrees under full load usually around 50 range.</p>

<p>
</p><p>that is one of the three unexpected shutdown events if someone can read what the problem is. I am debating whether or not it was a overheating issue or dying psu. I recently changed from the stock cooler and the temperature of the cpu doesnt go higher than
 58 on full load. That leads me to believe its the psu. Does this even tell you that? all three times have happened while running a game so I figured it was due to the cpu getting too hot now im not so sure..</p>

            does anyone know what this problem might be? I did realize that my bios seems a bit outdated idk how much of an impact that would make. I went ahead and disabled sleep mode in case the problem has to do with that. It seems that most of the cases have happened
 when the computer has returned out of this mode and upon entering a game. I have not confirmed that however.

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Bug, resulting in EPIC FAIL</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Now me not being ABLE to activate my Windows 10 is normal. (I used the media creation tool they ("they" would be Microsoft) made!) There's just one problem, and it's I couldn't see my DARN PRODUCT KEY! I was darn confused. Now how
 do you suppose I get a product key for Windows 10? (They promised me free..!)</p>

            <p>That's actually the problem ONLY with the discs. I still managed to upgrade, but I couldn't click on the links, so I couldn't get the key!<br />
Quick Edit: The previous install was Win 7. </p>
<p>Quick Edit: The activation was automatic on the "Get Windows 10" thing. I could not wait, but my approach was glitched.<br />

 not really seen an explanation of what I should do to fix it that was in terms that a non-techie like me could understand. Please help! I don't want to lose everything I have on the computer by reinstalling Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I will not, of course, be able to download the file that is referenced in the instructions since I cannot even start up my computer (it just goes directly to the error screen I described). I can download it onto a flash drive with a different computer but
 if I do that, how can I use that flash drive to get the file onto the non-functioning computer since I cannot even start that computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the instructions are from 2015. I didn't even put Windows 10 on my computer until June of 2016. Is the file that the instructions are telling me to install some kind of upgrade/fix file? If so, is it still applicable to my situation since I would assume
 that the version of Windows 10 that I installed in 2016 would have included that upgrade/fix already?</p>

<h2>            No 5.1 Surround sound option on windows 10.. receiver-tv-pc</h2>
                    <p>My 5.1 surround system is connected with optical cable to samsung tv then through HDMI cable to my computer with GTX 970 sound drivers. i cant switch to 5.1 surround as there is no option for it. it has been years apparently people have been complaining
 about it. why hasnt it been fixed yet.</p>
<p>i dont want a garbage answer from a moderator that just wants to build his rep up with replies. I would like it if Microsoft gave me an actual solution to this please as i want able to find one anywhere. tried all of the things people have suggested like
 updating and reinstalling drivers, enhancements, etc. </p>
<p>It seems the issue is the pc detects only 2 speakers from the TV so there needs to be a workaround to tell it the receiver is on the other side.
