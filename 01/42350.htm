<h2>            Exception Code &#40;c0000005&#41; - causing app crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've only had my laptop a few days but already I'm getting problems with app crashes (Exception Code (c0000005).&nbsp; I've no idea what this means not being tech-savvy, but it's disrupting several functions... including by IObit Advanced System Care utility
 which I thought was supposed to take care of all this stuff!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, sometimes an error message pops up, sometimes not.&nbsp; I've had to do a system refresh once because early on all my tiles disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really&nbsp;appreciate any assistance on how to get rid of these errors for good so I can actually use Windows to do something useful. rather than deal with endless problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a disk check and an SFC scannow which, apart from using the IObit software above, is about the limit of my capabilities!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi Sarah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Lifecam Cinema turning on when system boots up.</h2>
                    I have a Lifecam Cinema and for some reason it now turns on every time I boot my system up. I can't see any program that should be using the webcam but it is still on. I have to unplug the webcam and plug it back in so it will work for other applications.
 How can find out what is turning the cam on and what program is using it. and change so it wont just turn on.?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can disable the lifecam cinema from the startup tab using Clean boot procedure and see if it helps.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Follow <strong>step 7 </strong>to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Type <strong>Msconfig </strong>in the start search box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Now click the <strong>startup</strong> tab.</p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Now locate&nbsp; <strong>Lifecam cinema</strong> and uncheck it.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Click <strong>apply</strong> and then <strong>ok .</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

            Karla,
<br />The first thing to try is a two button restart:
<br />
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.

    <title>blue screen error after updating graphis driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> binoyghosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue screen error after updating graphis driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am using hp notebook laptop, hp 15-ba042au runs on Windows 10 Pro. It has AMD E-2 7110 Processor with Radeon R2&nbsp; graphics. Now, my installed graphics driver version is 18.5.1.
</p>
<p>About a month ago I got an update from AMD of the graphics driver, version 18.7.1. After updating, I got the blue screen error several times. So I search the internet and got many causes of blue screen error and one of them is due to the graphics driver.
 So, I uninstall the latest version(18.7.1) and reinstall the previous version(18.5.1).</p>
<p>And there is no such blue screen error. Now, I have another update 18.10.1. So, What should I do? Can I update the latest version?
</p>
<p>I really didn't understand what's happening. pls, help me.</p>

            Hi BINOYGHOSH,
<br />
<br />There is no way to know whether the new driver will cause a BSOD, the only way is to install the driver and see if your system is stable . . .
<br />
<br />Sometimes new drivers are released, especially for Video cards and they cause a conflict with other components on your system
<br />
<br />Yes, you should go ahead and try that update, if that is not successful and caused BSOD's again, you can always revert to that previous version

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi BINOYGHOSH,
<br />
<br />There seems to be a compatibility issue on your PC, your best option would be to roll back that driver to  the version (8.5.1) that works on your system and wait for Nvidia to resolve this with a patch. f you are having this trouble, then so are many other users and Nvidia needs to resolve this . . .

            Make sure you don't have an application such as CCleaner set up to delete dump files.
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file

            The Event Logs show several blue screen error the latest reported being Sep 2/18.
<br />
<br />The error was not consistent as there were different errors reported which may tend to absolve the video driver update.
<br />
<br />Usually a faulty driver tends to cause a specific repetitive error but not always.
<br />
<br />Looking at the System Information shows the AMD R2 graphics driver is at Driver Version 25.20.14003.1012 which according to the following link would indicate the 18.10.1 update has already been installed:

<br />
<br />From the link:
<br />
<br />Package Contents
<br />
<br />The Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition 18.10.1 installation package contains the following:

<p>
</p><p>There is no installation error when I download and install the offline Radeon R2 graphics installer from AMD official graphics download page.</p>

<h2>            Page Fault in Non Paged Area &#40;LV 302V64.sys&#41;</h2>
                    I upgraded from Win 7 to 10 a few weeks ago and am still learning how it works. Today, I decided to click on the 'Camera' app and got a blue screen message with the error as shown. Unsure on what to do now. I use an old Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX.
 I checked my skype and it is working just fine there. Anyone have a suggestion? Tks

            <p><strong>ZigZag....here is where I'm at, with following the instructions:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Minidump folder was empty and searched the complete C: drive for MEMORY.DMP....no file.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I saved the MSinfo32 file to the Desktop.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Downloaded Speccy and saved system info file to desktop. (I decided to create a restore point before I installed Speccy.)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Followed 'To ensure minidumps are enabled', steps and changed %systemroot%\Memorydump to Minidump...OK'd way out and rebooted.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Got Blue Screen error..<strong>."Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then you can restart.</strong> (100% complete)&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can search online for error: <strong>PAGEFAULT IN NONPAGE AREA (avgntflt.sys)</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Waited a couple of minutes and nothing happened, so I had to manually power down. (held PC power button down a few secs)....then powered back on.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>Rechecked Minidump folder....it now contains a file: <strong>
091515-37031-01.dmp</strong></p>
<p>I have not tried anything else at this time. Should I go back to my Restore Point, try something else, or save this new .dmp file to the desktop, compress them and upload? It may take a while to figure out how to use WinRar &amp; One Drive, but we can give it
 a try.</p>

            <p>Do you just want the .dmp file now, or all 3 files? I'm having trouble figuring out how to use WinRar and OneDrive. WinRar was showing in the Start menu under All Apps, but only had 2 document files....no app. I went to CNET an downloaded and reinstalled
 WinRar, but there was no change, so I went to File Explore and found the application file and did a Pin to Start. Now it and the help file are there. I added the 3 files from the desktop to WinRar and ran the wizard to 'Create New Archive'. A compressed file
 has now shown up in WinRar that I had named BSOD Problem.rar &nbsp;I hope this is correct. BUT, now, how do I use OneDrive. If I click on the task bar and the OneDrive icon, File Explore shows up. If this is the right place, how do I get the BSOD Problem.rar file
 into OneDrive....there is nothing that I can see that allows me to copy &amp; paste it? Sorry for sounding dumb, but this old fart just ain't that up on tech issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have worked this OneDrive thing out. I tried your OneDrive link in your reply &amp; uploaded the BSOD Problem.rar file. I hope this link below works:</p>

 time, I didn't realise it was a screen print and couldn't figure out how to sign in to my microsoft account, as nothing seemed to be working. (this gives you an idea of how computer savvy I am)!!! :( &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, here it is.</p>

            <p>As previously mentioned, I used to use TuneUp, later to become AVG TuneUP, for cleaning up my PC. I've always used Avira Antivirus Pro as my antivirus software. Approx Aug 8th, I uninstalled AVG and upgraded my Avira Antivirus Pro, to Avira Internet Security
 Suite, which includes Antivirus Pro, System Speedup (replaces TuneUp), Browser Safety and Identity Safeguard. Since working on this issue, I found other folders/files I was sure were connected to AVG and have since deleted them...actually just yesterday. I
 have the built in defender (Windows Defender) disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's my next question....can I safely do a search of the C: drive for each of these files and just remove them, or, is there some way to tell which ones I still need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help and patience...</p>

    <title>Disc drive making beeps when I put in a disc. Is this normal&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microlink&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc drive making beeps when I put in a disc. Is this normal&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This happened 4-5 times. I put in Fable 3 and the console was fine but I heard this low pitched beeping sound (not VERY low pitched, but not high pitched either) and occasionally when I played. It happened with Black Ops as well. It did not interrupt gameplay,
 it just beeped. Not sure if it's the disc drive going on me or what, I've only had the thing since Christmas. I tried putting Battlefield 3 in and it did not beep.</p>
<p>Here is a video I recorded of the sound. You may have to turn up the volume a bit, and it is near the end. You'll probably know when you hear it. It kind of sounds like a check-out at a grocery store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;http://s1175.photobucket.com/albums/r629/toonlink989591/?action=view&amp;current=xboxsound.mp4</p>

<p>it's an Xbox 360 SLIM, just so you know. I put in Fable 3 in again a few minutes ago and it was fine. I even played around 10 minutes of the game and didn't get that beep.. thank goodness. &nbsp;EDIT: To be precise the beep is at EXACTLY 2 seconds in.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure it's failing, but it's a sound that has peaked my interest. The console's performance hasn't gone, it's just the beep that is making me wonder. I can't get it to happen again, so I don't know. Could it have been the way I inserted the disc?
 If I hear the sound again I will probably contact support.</p>

<p>Just an FYI. You do know that the Normal Slim consoles will beep if the eject/power buttons are touched?</p>
<p>You could try unplugging the console and then wiping the 2 buttons with a DRY TOWEL. Sometimes fingerprrints causes the sensors to glitch.</p>
<p>If the console shows no sign of proformance issues then just let it be. You are still under the warrenty untill christmas so really you have time to see if its a serious problem.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of the beeping, but this is a different kind of beeping. If you copy and pasted the Photobucket link I posted, you'd be able to hear the beep I am talking about. I just put in a disc and I heard the sound yet again. I'm starting to think
 it is something serious, and I have already sent an email to Xbox Support.</p>
<p>I have one question, this is my first Xbox, so if they want me to send in my Xbox, do I take apart the entire console? Do I send the console with the hard drive in or do I take the hard drive out and just send the console?</p>

<p>Greetings, shreds97. If you have any questions about the repair process please take a look at this support article titled "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/repair/warranty-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 repair: Frequently asked question</a>s".
 Just for clarification, is this issue impacting your gameplay or the way your console functions? It seems like it only occurs when you insert a disc. Is that correct? Are the games you mentioned currently installed on your hard drive? Let me know! :)</p>
        </p>

<p>Some games are installed, some are not. Skyrim, Quantum of Solace, and Left 4 Dead are on my hard drive. The beep only happens when it's reading the disc when I put it in but does NOT happen when playing. The rest of my games are not installed and make the
 noise when it is first reading the disc and occasionally when playing. Doesn't seem to be affecting gameplay but it sounds like the Xbox's disc drive's laser or something. It only happens when I insert a disc and even when the sound occurs the Xbox doesn't
 freeze up. I had some lag in Skyrim (pretty bad) but I think that was only because I have a lot of games on the hard drive so clearing the cache seemed to solve that for the most part... but then again Skyrim lags for me if I don't play it in a loooong time
 (not sure why but it happens and has only freezed once but that was 2 months ago)</p>
<p>It doesn't APPEAR to affect my console nor gameplay. It's a sound that just irks me. It sounds like the beeping when someone is scanning products at a store, such as Wal-Mart. I contacted Xbox Support and I got a response saying that they never heard of
 such a thing and that if it continues to happen and if it impacts gameplay or console functionality to "not hesitate to call us." Not really sure why they don't know, but I guess I can't really blame them since I've never heard the sound on any Xbox I've encountered.

            <p>Hey shreds97! Unfortunately this may be a case of a slightly noisy disc drive. When did you purchase your console? I noticed the stickler on the disc tray - was it relatively recently? If so, are you able to exchange it with your retailer? A different console would likely not exhibit that sound. :) </p>

<p>I got the Xbox as a Christmas gift (2011) so it's been around 7 or 8 months now. My friend who also owns an Xbox said her Xbox occasionally makes the sound that mine's been doing, but I don't know what could be causing it. I haven't been hearing it much
 lately, though. It sounds to me like it's the laser in the disc drive. If I continue to hear this sound I will probably get a new console.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, shreds. As Miss Portia noted it seems like this is merely a case of a slightly noisy disc drive. It seems like the noise has somewhat subsided for you, which is great! Keep us posted if the noise comes back and if you decide to get
 a new console. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this issue occur only on Microsoft Edge or on Internet Explorer too?</p>
<p>Have you checked in Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, I suggest you to delete the Caches and Cookies of the Browser and install the latest drivers for the PC.</p>

            I went to my pc website and downloaded every driver update they offered. When I go to Pinterest one of two things happens, it either freezes with a shaded screen as if it is processing, or, it works but when I press the add pin button to browser, nothing
 happens. This is the same response as&nbsp;before I went through and made sure I had all updated drivers and software.

            It works in Firefox too. Hope they add this to the Microsoft edge browser soon - no pinterest button is&nbsp; a deal breaker for me.

<h2>            Windows App Store trouble</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble logging into the Windows App Store. I used my Yahoo email to sign up just today. I already redeemed a code for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition in Chrome, only then to realise that the Windows App Store built into Windows 10 will not let
 me sign in. It says "Are you sure that's the right email address? This organisation doesn't support joining Azure AD."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure that it is the correct email. Also, I put in my password, pressed enter and it does bring me back where I started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>

    <title>Trying to add account to Windows Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennislong63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to add account to Windows Mail</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to setup an email and receive emails from 3dcartstores.com using Windows 8.1, the blue Mail tile.</p>
<p>After the mail program opens, I go to right side of screen, click on settings when black bar slides out.</p>
<p>Then click on Accounts.</p>
<p>Click on Add an account.</p>
<p>Click on Other account.</p>
<p>Enter the information required by 3dcart,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Incoming mail and outgoing mail Server should be: mail.3dcartstores.com <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Port should be: 495 for incoming and 465 for outgoing smtp.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My internet provider is Charter in Northern Michigan. I have always had email trouble with Charter.</p>
<p>3dcart told me that when they setup the account, it worked. But I have tried setting this account up a number of ways and I cannot get it to work.</p>
<p>Now 3dcart is mad and me and thinks I do not know what I am doing. I have sent them a number of pictures to show them the steps I took &amp; putting in the information at each step.</p>
<p>I tried to add the pictures, but they take up the whole screen. I do have them.</p>
<p>I do not like outlook.com, nor does my wife, as you cannot do as much with outlook as you can with Windows Live Mail in Windows 7.</p>
<p>But I am finding that mail using the blue tile is not very good either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>What happens if you set up a new account to use the servers you named, using port 993 for incoming and 465 for outgoing? "no luck" doesn't really help&nbsp;with diagnosing the problem.</p>

<p>I'm more inclined to think that it's the Mail app that's stupid. Perhaps it doesn't like the mismatch between the mail server's domain and the email address - I've seen wackier things. Since
<strong>mail.nokout.us</strong> is an alias of <strong>mail.3dcartstores.com</strong> (both resolve to &nbsp;208.43.49.137), you might pacify the beast by entering
<strong>mail.nokout.us</strong> as the server both for IMAP and SMTP.</p>

<h2>            Duplicating file in drive C</h2>
                    Heey people,, <br />
There is this folder-"HPQLOG" it is under the folder "Program Data" in drive C, my computer had alerted me on low disk space and i wondered what had occupied such a big space on the disk until i discovered that this folder had occupied a cool 232GB which was
 abnormal<br />
<br />
, i run a disk scan with AVG which didn't solve the problem,<br />
&nbsp;i tried to delete this folder which deleted all files except one which is 50GB, <br />
<br />
That was yesterday,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;today, it haD occupied the 230 going to 250GB!!<br />
&nbsp;i tried deleting again but this file-8GB refused to delete again saying that it couldn't delete because the file was being used by another program even though no other programs were running.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have tried to use the 'restore default' option in the folder's properties but it still doesn't want to delete, these files, which are XML type which call themselves
<b>HPSecurity tools </b>are currently duplicating thmselves, please advise

<h2>            Canon printer does not respond.</h2>
                    This HP Folio with Windows 7 does not detect my Canon MX726 anymore. It used to do it until yesterday...The other PC I have (XP) has no problem, so I know the printer's wireless connectivity is OK. It tried several fixes like reinstalling drivers but still
 cannot detect. I tried the Canon IJ tool but printer is not found. If I put a USB cable, then it is fine. I really wonder what it is the issue.

            <p>Thank Naman. I hesitate to reinstall the printer as, during installation, it will ask to connect to the printer (via wireless) and if it cannot, I shall be stuck.</p>
<p>What I'd like to understand is why I cannot ping the IP address of the printer on my SSID network...I know the address through the other XP PC. On the other PC, no problem at all when typing the IP address in a browser. On this one, pinging has no result,
 it is not detected. What can block the IP address to be detected while it was the case days ago?? Any networking tip?</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Alain</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I solved the issue after reading on networks. It was a network issue. This PC was connected to a relay router I use for the second floor (I realised that when it would only ping LAN connections but not wireless devices and also it lost its internet connection
 when I disconnected the LAN cable from the primary router). I disconnected the PC from that router and removed that network. The printer is now online again. I don't know why the kids upstairs who always connect to the relay have no problem but I am not a
 network expert...Glad I did not follow advice from here.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Moving Microsoft Visual Studio into another drive</h2>
                    <p>As I am nearing the limits of my C drive, I have been purging applications and moving them to&nbsp;a secondary D drive. One of the uninstalled apps, Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Pro, opened up space on my drive, but also left about 29 uninstalled programs (and
 I assume, many unnecessary folders). According to a couple of Google searches, uninstalling these programs, even if done in the correct order, could cause some problems down the line. However, I do want to install this program on my D drive. Would installing
 visual studio on my d drive cause any problems (as there are&nbsp;29 programs related to visual studio on&nbsp;the C drive)?

<p>I've only used Skype once before over a year ago and must admit that I am not too fond of talking to others online. However, this nice young lady tried to communicate with me and I can't get back to her?</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is on the list on the left hand side of the app, showing the time that she called. I have clicked and double clicked on her name and photo on the list and still can not get connected to her?</p>

<p><br />
First, note that in your question you save "save" but in the subject line you say "download." There is no downloading involved here. What you need to do is simply copy the files (whether photos or any other kind of files) to the external drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell us what "cant save" means. Exactly how are you trying? What happens when you try? If you get an error message, please quote it verbatim. Copying files to an external drive is exactly like copying them from one folder on yout internal drive to
 another; there's no difference.</p>

            Hi Sammy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.

<h2>            Direct serial port access</h2>
                    I have older program that needs a direct connection to serial (rs233) port. It does not work in windows 7 because there is not direct access to serial port hw. How can I enable direct access to serial port?<br />
In XP I used giveio.sys but it is not working in win7.

<p><span>Hello Novicexyz,</span></p>
<p><span>If your unable to run the program in windows 7, let’s try to install the programs in compatibility mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Program compatibility is a mode in
<span>Windows</span> that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of <span>
Windows</span>. Most programs written for <span>Windows</span>&nbsp;XP also work in this version of
<span>Windows</span>, but some older programs might run poorly or not run at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Most programs written for
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> also work in this version of <span>Windows</span>, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of
<span>Windows</span> doesn't run correctly, you can try changing the compatibility settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Make sure that this program can only be used in windows 7 professional, Enterprise and Ultimate edition.
</span></p>
<p><span>To install the programs in XP compatibility mode, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the program icon and select properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on the compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under compatibility mode check “Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the drop down menu, select Windows Xp.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link for more information:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></strong></p>

<h2>            How to find Windows media Center</h2>
                    
<p>I am asking this on behalf of my friend who came to me for help because he is hardly computer literate.</p>
<p>Home Premium Win 7. About 4 months old.<br />
He said at one time he was playing around with Windows media center, thinking that it was Media Player.<br />
Today he realizes that he cannot find WMC any more.</p>
<p>I told him about Vista method of&nbsp;locating ehshell.exe&nbsp;...<br />
Start &gt; search box, enter ehome &gt; Enter &gt; scroll the list for it.<br />
It did not work for him. Entering ehome in search box did not bring up <br />
C:\windows\ehome window.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me how to call&nbsp; up WMC ? Thank you.</p>
