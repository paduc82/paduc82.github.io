In the Process of doing that i wasn't able to complete it. The case review was accidentally submitted with me saying "Dear Microsoft Enforcement Team". Hopefully with&nbsp;&nbsp;any chance you would&nbsp;help me submit another case review or get my account unbanned. The Representative told me to make another account because i couldn't make a forum on my Spoildstone01 account.&nbsp;Here my Reference Number from a Support Team Member: SRX1421147669ID</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Secure Boot isn&#39;t configured correctly Build 9600</h2>
                    <p>We have a 6 month old Asus CM6730 which I upgraded from the Windows Store to 8.1 yesterday.&nbsp; Noticed PC is now running slower and jerky in MS card game.&nbsp; Getting a very irritating msg in lower RH corner:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Secure Boot isn't configured correctly<br />
</p>
<p>Build 9600</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Secure Boot has been checked and reset in BIOS.<br />
When is Microsoft tech support going to release a bug fix for this?&nbsp; Or does it need to be uninstalled?&nbsp; Shades of MS DOS 4.0!</p>

<p>Please respond ASAP?<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />

    <title>Microsoft Has Lost My Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> longdongkon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Has Lost My Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>So, I'm looking to see if anyone out there has experienced this same issue......</p>

<p>A month ago, I noticed my Xbox One wasn't playing any of my Blu-Ray DVDs. However, it was able to play games just fine. So I created a service request on 07/26 and shipped it to MSFT CORP in McAllen, TX (I live in Katy, TX). I received confirmation on 07/31
 that my Xbox was received.&nbsp;1 week went by and I finally received an Email stating that my&nbsp;service request had been completed and that the system was being prepared to ship (08/07/15). Also, my tracking number was "Manual_Shipment" (yeah....that's helpful)
 and that there is a 3-7 day processing period. I contacted Microsoft and requested a tracking number and was told that they could not provide one, but to be rest assured that my Xbox would arrive soon. 10 days go by and I'm wondering where my xbox is. I once
 again contacted customer support and was told that they are unable to find ANY information on when my Xbox was shipped from McAllen, TX to me (in Katy, TX), nor could they find record of what address it was sent to or what tracking number is was sent with.
 I am currently waiting to be contacted by the&nbsp;Escalation Department for more information. At this point, I feel like my Xbox is gone. There is no way it would take more than 10 days to be shipped across Texas, unless "Manual_Shipment" means they just tied
 it to a carrier pigeon's leg and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>Has anyone else dealt with this issue before? I really need help here.</p>


<p>Thank you</p>

<p>So Microsoft haven't lost your XBox ONE.</p>
<p>But it's still a poor experience and you're really the only person I've heard of have this specific problem though when the ONE launched there were a couple of guys complaining that the carrier had made errors.</p>
<p>It's frustrating to have to wait in a digital age when we're so used to getting things immediately.</p>
<p>Just make a note of the information and timescales given and follow it up religiously.</p>
<p>Eventually you'll get your ONE back or it will get escalated high enough for it to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Hope you're not waiting too long.</p>

<p>Maybe you're right, they may not have lost it. However, no one is able to tell me where it is, who it was shipped with, where it was shipped to, etc. There is no note of any of that information, while I was told there should be. My understanding is that
 it has been 11 days since my Xbox was shipped back to me. At this point, I feel that it should have either arrived or there should be information about its shipment somewhere. I have no problem with waiting. If waiting was an issue, I would have never sent
 my Xbox in to be serviced. I knew I'd have to wait. But I have a hard time accepting that they can't tell me where it is, nor promise me that I will receive it. I just really hope they find it or find record of where it was sent to.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. </p>

<p>Man that is terrible. &nbsp;MS needs to do better than this and require more from whoever they have service the repairs. &nbsp;I can say that on anything I have returned or exchanged in the last 5 years, at least, has had tracking. &nbsp;If MS was the responsible party
 for shipping and cannot track it or tell what is going on they basically lost it. &nbsp;I mean, how hard would it be to get this thing back and call them and tell them you never received it (not recommended since this is very dishonest). &nbsp;And since they have no
 tracking information they could not prove otherwise (unless there was a lie about the tracking information being known). &nbsp;Considering everyone is not going to be honest I could see that being an issue. &nbsp;Unless they are going to basically assume that it made
 it and then if it gets lost just assume no responsibility.</p>
<p>I had to have a 360 repaired under warranty for a drive failure a long time back. &nbsp;And it did arrive fairly quickly. &nbsp;But I do remember there being no tracking.</p>

<p>Ah, this actually is a little common, not long ago someone was posting about this very issue, he literally called over and over until he got someone who knew what they were talking about as previously he was just getting passed around.</p>
<p>He even dropped the support agents name in the thread for others, but I just can't remember what the title of the thread was, sorry. I suggest to just keep on them.</p>

<p>Update: </p>
<p>I have received an email from Microsoft confirming that they have indeed lost my Xbox, and will be send me a refurbished one. It is now 09/04; almost 6 weeks since I created my service request. This is an utter pathetic display of customer service. I have
 about had it with Microsoft. if I didn't already have money invested in Xbox, I'd say screw it and go buy a PlayStation. I'm so incredibly angered by how long this has taken and how no one has offered compensation for the time I've spent waiting. all I will
 get out of this is a refurbished Xbox and 6 weeks of Xbox live wasted. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I know this is frustrating, but there generally isn't anything wrong with a "refurb". Technically speaking after they fixed yours, it is now a "refurb" as well.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Did they actually lose it in the factory, or did it get lost in the mail? If the latter, it isn't their fault.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Why don't you call them up and ask if they will extend you Live. They have done that for me in the past. Just remember be polite and calm when doing this or they probably won't be inclined to do so.</p>

<p>I agree with the refurbished part. I was just hoping to have mine back because I kept it's exterior in pristine condition. I don't want one that's dinged up and scratched (not saying that will happen but it has in the past with other consoles).
</p>
<p>It was either lost at the service department or in transit back to me. However, there is no record of its shipment, where it was shipped to, when it was shipped, nor any tracking information. Which I have been told by customer service reps is very unusual.
 Either way, I hold them completely responsible.</p>
<p>I have requested an extension on my live subscription and been told that I will receive one once I receive an Xbox. Which I am still waiting for.
</p>
<p>I guess I just expected a lot more out of a company that has been doing this for 14 years and is worth 70 Billion dollars. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What!? @Lofty?</p>
<p>Pepsi all the way! WTH is wrong with you and that 'It's OK to like Coke' stuff?!</p>
<p>I used to like Coke, then I went Pepsi and never turned back. I don't care if Coke has higher resolution and it doesn't matter to me if it focuses more on cola drinking! Pepsi people have better social experiences. When my friends and I are talking and drinking
 Pepsi, I get more&nbsp;fps (fun per sip)&nbsp;from the can and we talk about more things. Coke can have their sps (sips per second)!</p>
<p>Those who drink both don't count either... their taste buds are just fried from the Coke and they can't tell what is good anymore!</p>
<p>SMH... everyone knows Coke is rubbish... get real, man...</p>

<h2>            skype number not working</h2>
                    i have been having problems ith my skype number since the newest update, i cant hear it ring on my iphone, only when it shows as a lost call i see it. i see a lot , actually most people have this issue, we pay for a skype number , on top of that i must
 redirect to my original number, and then pay the rate, or call back using my skype credit. when will this be fixed, if ever? please respond or is it necessary to stop using skype and find another solution, this is not an upgrade, it is a complete disaster
 and failure. regards linda&nbsp;

<p>Hello&nbsp;linda haadiyaholthe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you resolve the issue, please try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>1. Check if your Skype account is active on other devices, log them out and use one device one.</p>
<p>2. Make a test call to your online number and check if you will be able to receive it or it will still appear as missed call.</p>
<p>3. Check the privacy settings for your online number, if it is set to allow calls to contacts only. Please be informed that you need laptop or desktop to check your online number settings.</p>

            You can check to see if this program is compatible with Vista at the Vista Compatibility Center at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/default.aspx</a>.&nbsp; If it isn't listed, then it wasn't tested and quite often that means it isn't fully compatible (but not necessarily).&nbsp; There may also be some information about this on the web site
 of the program - though you should believe what you read from Microsoft before believing what they write on the site concerning compatibility.&nbsp; What is the name and version of the program you're trying to install (and the web site link if possible)?<br />
<br />
If it was a download, re-download the program (the original download may be corrupted) and try again - make sure you are using a version compatible with Vista.&nbsp; Just to be sure, right click on the installation executable file and click on run as administrator
 (even if you are already logged in as an administrator).&nbsp; This sometimes works.&nbsp; If it is a CD, then clean the CD lightly with a soft tissue going from center to edge - it may be smudged or scratched and this may help it get past the problem.<br />
<br />
If none of the above work, then you need to contact the program designer (either at their web site or by phone) for technical support.&nbsp; They may also have a forum like this one which may provide valuable information.&nbsp; We can't help you find these resources
 since you didn't provide us with the name of the program.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Assuming the program will run on your Windows version try installing it by Right Clicking on the<br />
Setup or Install file and RUN AS ADMIN. If no joy check with the program's developer.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>How do I burn a DVD using Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#35;michael&#35;cedar&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I burn a DVD using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows10 and Office 2013. I used to burn holiday dvd's using Windows 7 but cannot do it in Windows 10. I can edit put on music etc but cannot burn to dvd. I used to open up Movie Maker, save the dvd
<strong>and burn</strong><strong> it</strong> from the drop down menu at the top of the screen on the right hand side. There is not a choice to Burn in the drop down menu. I have saved the dvd in "recommended for this project and HD" neither gives you an option
 to burn. When you have asked it to save as, &nbsp;there is a choice of either MPEG-4/H.264 Video file OR Windows Media Video file. I choose MPEG-4. It &nbsp;it goes through the motions of stage 1 and then stage 2. When it has finished saving, there is a choice in a
 box in the middle of the screen of either Play, open folder or close. There is no option to burn.</p>
<p>I have looked for solutions but it advises to burn from the drop down menu. I know someone else with Windows 10 and there's is the same.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay but I have been away on holiday for a few days.</p>
<p>I have tried to follow the procedure which I cannot make work so if I can I would like to clarify a few things.</p>
<p>I insert a blank dvd in the device.</p>
<p>I open up a project in Movie Maker. I am using an edited but not saved as you used to in Windows 7. This looks like a film roll and it is coloured orange &amp; blue. The size of this is 146kb and it is 29 mins 26 secs long.</p>
<p>When I click "File" and then "publish" it offers One Drive, Face Book, Youtube, Vimeo Flicker Groups, Add a Plug in, Manage your Services. NO DVD option.</p>
<p>If I save the Movie as I used to do in Windows 7 using "Recommended for this project or HD" it offer a choice of MPEG-4/H2.64 or Windows media file. If I choose MPEG it saves the Movie (I name it slightly differently) when it has finished saving it asks
 " play, open folder or close. The result is an object in my Video file that looks like a 35mm single negative but with 3.98GB. &nbsp;If I click this it plays in Media Player.</p>
<p>If I choose to right click this and send to dvd drive a balloon in the bottom right of the screen &nbsp;says you have files waiting to be written to disc. If I drag these to the dvd player and then right click again I can burn to disc. I put in a disc name click
 next it starts to burn. Great you think however when the disc has burned and put it in a dvd player it says "disc error" and it takes ages to eject.</p>
<p>Sorry about this but can you offer any advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;reply and providing&nbsp;the brief description&nbsp;of the issue. We apologize for the delay&nbsp;in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods provided below and check if it helps:<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Delete the files from the burn folder in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a&nbsp;file is set to burn to a CD/DVD, it will be copied to a temporary location, and then a disk image file is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Empty the files from the following location on&nbsp;your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>C:\users\(username)\appdata\local\Microsoft\windows\burn</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer after the temporary burn files are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Run a SFC (System File Checker) scan.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start button and select “Command Prompt (Admin)”.</li><li>Type “sfc /scannow” and press Enter.</li><li>After the scan is complete, type “exit” and press Enter.</li></ol>
<p>

            Thank you for your reply. I carried out all the checks and even bought new discs. I was chatting to my daughter and she tells me that an MP4 file will not play on a DVD player. When you save the edited film in Movie Maker it saves as an MP4 file. In windows
 7 you saved it, then burned it and it worked, not so in Windows 10. It is very disappointing to find that I have got to buy a third party file converter to enable it to be played in a DVD player. I am not aware that Microsoft produce one. If they do please
 let me know. Thank you.

<p>Face recognition and tagging would be incredibly useful! Because whenever I take a photo of a friend or a family member, it will be able to recognize them and puts their photos in their own face collection which then I will be able to share their face collection
 with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, all my friends and family members will instantly get notification from OneDrive whenever I take a photo of them. and they can see it in their OneDrive or Photos App on Windows without me having to create an Album for each event, put their photo
 in that album one by one and then email them a link to that Album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like this, Everything gets fully automatic! All I have to do is just keep taking pictures with my phone, it automatically uploads to OneDrive and detects faces. then friends and family members gets to see their photos instantly!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be amazing! because it would bring more people to OneDrive and Photos App. They will use it daily because they can all see each other's photos with ease and rate and comment on each other photos.</p>

<h3> gcibsthom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open .php or .asp files</h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium, and just installed WAMP to learn PHP. I have created one file and tried to open, but all I get is a file download progress bar and also the file download dialog, asking if I want to Open or Save the file. I already have
 the file on my computer, so I obviously don't want to save, but if I hit save, it goes to a save as dialog. If I hit Open, nothing happens. Either way, it seems that the file download dialog (and progress bar, should not be coming up just because I try to
 open. Is the system trying to download from my machine to my machine? Again, either way the files will not open. I tried with other .php and .asp files (IIS is turned off - I also tried with IIS turned on, but that did not help.) I am sure that this is some
 really simple setting that I am overlooking. But anyway, I have looked all over the net and in books for a solution to this, but could not find this problem described anywhere. Thanks in advance for the help.

    <title>Windows 10 Xbox app not working with Voicemeeter Banana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jw52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox app not working with Voicemeeter Banana</h2>
                    <p>I use my PC to stream, and in order to control and separate all my audio inputs (especially desktop audio) I use voicemeeter banana.&nbsp; I use a blue yeti to talk to my stream, and I also need to use it to talk to my fellow players in party chat.&nbsp; So I connect
 to party chat through the windows 10 Xbox one app.&nbsp; for the last few weeks whenever I connect to a party with voicemeeter running I get "the sample rate for your microphone isn't supported", but if I shutdown voicemeeter I can reconnect and it works.&nbsp; all
 of my settings for audio are set to 44.1Hz.&nbsp; What can I do to fix this problem??&nbsp; All of my drivers say they are up to date.&nbsp; Is there something else like voicemeeter i can use instead??</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little extra info.&nbsp; With voicemeeter i have my mic, spotify, Xbox game audio, desktop audio (party chat, chrome brower, etc.), and discord all on their own audio channel.&nbsp; This allows me to mix the level as if i was using a mixing board with everything
 being plugged in by its own cable.&nbsp; with out being able to use voicemeeter I cannot separate spotify from my desktop audio so when i stream with OBS when I startup and play music during my intro screen I also get my party as well.&nbsp; With voicemeeter spotify
 is using a virtual cable and is separated out to it's own channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be much appreciated&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem customizing image file folder icons,  &#40;change thumbnails&#41;.</h2>
                    After going through the Customize procedure, via Properties, for an image file folder, (to change the shown thumbnail/s),&nbsp; I have to run Disk Cleanup, clearing thumbnails, for the change to take effect ....&nbsp; as the folders with thumbnails reload.<br />
<br />
This is recent .... only happening with the most recent folders .... all older folders take any change in the normal manner.<br />

I hope this is clear enough to prompt some help and many thanks for any offered.<br />

<br />
.................................................................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Folder Properties &gt; Customization:<br />
<br />
1. Folder pictures&nbsp; &gt; click Choose File... &gt; choose file (but ignore Apply)<br />
<br />
2. Folder icons &gt; click Change Icon &gt; click Restore Defaults (on Change Icon pane) &gt; click Apply<br />
<br />
..................................................................................................................................................................<br />

That's it ... easy "workaround" found last night. Many thanks to 'ak40saj' in Windows 7 Forums.<br />

<h3> speical risk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Not Turn on File History&#59; Win 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new computer with a fresh install of Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; After installing a few programs I plugged in a 1T. external USB drive to use for back up.&nbsp; The drive is freshly re-formatted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I try to set up the Back Up, it searches and finds the drive, bit when I try to turn the File History on I get a message "Could Not Enable File History.&nbsp; either the device is disabled or no enabled device is associated with it."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can dump a drive image file to the USB drive and read/write to it.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to "associate" the drive with File History.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            You have to turn on the Windows Search service (the indexing service). After that, no problem with File History.

            It's absolutely the same for Windows 8.1, and not so technical. See the link, Option 1, and on figure under point 4 you can see just the required service highlighted. To start it, you have to change "disabled" to "automatic". That's all.

<p><strong><em>Is something wrong?</em></strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily. You would have done better not to have set the system such a large task. Using Automatic Updating results in the kind of experience you are seeing.</p>
<p>You can cancel the update and start again breaking the task into a number of smaller tasks. If there is a problem with one update it can greatly simplify how it is resolved.<br />
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_8154225_stop-automatic-update-progress.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_8154225_stop-automatic-update-progress.html</a></p>
<p><span>Here are some notes that may help resolve problems encountered when installing Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>The process of installing updates comprises downloading, installing and configuring the operating system to use the new updates. Some updates require the computer to be restarted and when this occurs configuring occurs as the system is shut down and
 is completed when the computer is restarted. It is important not to interrupt the configuration process as configuration involves making changes to the registry. If interrupted, the result can be a computer that will not boot.</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of problems arise from setting Windows Update to automatically update. You may prefer to change this setting. Select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on
 the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to “Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them” and click on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you encounter problems updating or you are not using the Automatic Update you should manually update by selecting Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to install, click on Install and
 click again on Install in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need
 to be patient. </span></p>
<p><span>If you have a number of updates to install break the task of updating into two or more tasks. If you have been having problems with Windows Update run Disk CleanUp (or better still cCleaner) and Disk Defragmenter ( or better still Defraggler) before
 installing any large download.</span></p>
<p><span>If the measures above fail to resolve your problem select Start, All Programs, View Update History and post the Failure Code and Update reference number to the Windows Update Forum at Microsoft Answers.</span></p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a corrupted profile is one of the possible reasons why you are unable to install the game Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare. To help you resolve this concern, we recommend that you perform the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps. This can help remove problems with an app from Microsoft Store. To do this, you may refer to the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Sign out and sign in your profile from Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Windows <strong>Store app</strong>, and click on the <strong>user icon</strong> located on the top right hand side of the window.</li><li>Select the <strong>user name</strong>, and click on <strong>Sign out</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, kindly clear the store cache one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the results.</p>

                    <p>I get error code 800F0904 when trying to download and install SP1 for Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; The install hangs up at 1% every time.&nbsp; I have tried the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing in a clean boot state</p>
<p>Installing in safe mode (w/ networking)</p>
<p>Disabling all virus software</p>
<p>Disabling UAC &amp; Firewall</p>
<p>Downloading/Installing via the Microsoft Download Center</p>
<p>Running troubleshooter for windows update</p>
<p>Running the system update readiness tool</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I download/install from the download center, it tries to install Windows Debugging Symbols (which I have installed several times, hoping that it might be the right thing, just disguised).&nbsp; I have not downloaded the .iso file, which might be my next
 step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've read this string of messages and followed the&nbsp;suggested steps, but I'm STILL having&nbsp;lock ups.&nbsp; (The PC will not do anything; it has to be manually shut down and restarted.)&nbsp; One thing I've noticed is that quite often the PC is performing "maintenance"
 when it locks up.&nbsp; Not every time, but quite often.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;adjusted scheduled maintenance times, but the PC&nbsp;conducts maintenance&nbsp;whenever it chooses to (i.e., when it's idle).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also, I've tried to run&nbsp;some programs to see if this has any effect, but the lock ups do not appear to be linked&nbsp;to any one program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I saw that you recommended emptying&nbsp;the Event Viewer memory (which I&nbsp;did, with no change in lock up frequency).&nbsp; If you wish, I can retrieve an Event and let you inspect it.&nbsp; Please advise....</p>

                    <p>Original title: Dell KB216t</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell KB216t with my desktop.&nbsp; It came without instructions.&nbsp; Some of the keys are obviously double function.&nbsp; One function is printed in gray and one in blue.&nbsp; The insert key (gray)&nbsp;doubles with the Print Screen (blue),&nbsp;one key with both words imprinted
 on it.&nbsp; I would like to know how to switch between the functions.&nbsp; There are 9 keys labelled this way.&nbsp; I have contacted Dell several times and talked with as many techs.&nbsp; Nobody seems to know what to do.&nbsp; The last tech said he would send me a new keyboard.&nbsp;
 I don't think this will help.&nbsp; The problem is in the step to switch functions.&nbsp; If anybody knows how to do this, please let me know.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have a new computer and have made no changes. &nbsp;My printer is HP,but I don't think that impacts on print screen or alt+printscreen working. &nbsp;If I had no printer connected, print screen should still function. &nbsp;Because my computer is only a few days old,
 there have been no updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is similar to a scientific calculator I have. &nbsp;There is a key that controls first or second function. &nbsp;If this keyboard had a similar key then the first function on a particular key would be the insert function and the second function on that same key
 would be print screen. &nbsp;Another key has page up as the primary function and pause break as the second. &nbsp;The first functions are printed in gray and the second is blue. &nbsp;I am trying to learn how to switch between first and second function.</p>
<p>

            <p>I was able to get the answer to this question and am passing it along to others who might find it helpful.&nbsp; The second left key on the bottom row of the keyboard is a function key designated by Fn.&nbsp; If that is depressed with print screen, you will get the
 screenshot.&nbsp; The leftmost key is the control key.&nbsp; Depress that with the function and print screen, and a link to the screenshot will be copied on the clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Print Screen is a secondary function on this keyboard with insert primary on the given key.&nbsp; Thus any secondary function can be accessed by following the above directives for print screen.</p>

<div>Evening everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm having issues trying to connect my computer to the internet. Originally the issue was that the Ethernet cable doesn't have a valid IP configuration. I then proceed to use Command Prompt to run &lt;netsh winsock reset&gt; and &lt;netsh int ip reset&gt;. The second command
 wasn't working correctly so I had to go into the registry to allow the command to work. Here's a general list of things I've done.
<ul>
<li>Diabled and enabled the adapter</li><li>Swapped ethernet cables</li><li>Tried different ports on router</li><li>Check to see if DHCP was enabled</li><li>Updated adapter drivers</li><li>Disabled all anti-virus and firewalls in safe mode to see if I can ping localhost</li></ul>
<br />
Here's where it gets interesting, I can't ping the local host. It gives me a "General Failure" comment. Now, I've gone ahead and set up a static IP address for my computer using Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8) but I still can't access the internet and regardless
 of what I do I can't ping the local host.<br />
<br />
Window's diagnostic for my ethernet adapter is that it works but the DNS isn't working.<br />
Any and all help would be appreciated.</div>
