<h2>            Windows Vista Student Version - can I still use it after graduation LEGALLY</h2>
                    <p>Does the licensing conditions allow continued use after graduation without violating license.</p>
<p>Also: what if , after I intall this operating system onto my computer then later on sell the computer. Is the new owner, although not a student, legally allowed to use it?</p>
<p>Your kind assistance will alleviate much anxiety on this matter</p>

    <title>Some Metro Apps - No Internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some Metro Apps - No Internet</h2>
                    Good day
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently upgraded from Windows 7 (64 bit) to Windows 8 Pro (64 bit). So far I am overall very pleased with</div>
<div>Windows 8 but there is one issue.</div>
<div>Some Metro Apps don't want to connect to the internet. I can access the web from the desktop, download etc. but no internet access</div>
<div>in the Metro UI.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have done everything I can:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Disabled my Anti Virus and Firewall (Using Bitdefender 2013)</div>
<div>2. Reset my PPPoE connection</div>
<div>3. Checked that my&nbsp;graphics&nbsp;drivers are up to date and above the required resolution amount to run Metro Apps</div>
<div>4. I switched back to my Local Account from my Microsoft Account and back</div>
<div>5. Deleted the Apps that doesn't work and&nbsp;re-downloaded them&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now it's not all the Metro Apps that doesn't work. The following Metro Apps works great:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Internet Explorer 10</div>
<div>Windows Store</div>
<div>Skype</div>
<div>Bing Search</div>
<div>Messaging</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BUT, the majority of the Apps don't, like:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bing Maps</div>
<div>Mail</div>
<div>Google Search</div>
<div>Games</div>
<div>Finance</div>
<div>News</div>
<div>Wikipedia</div>
<div>Weather</div>
<div>SkyDrive (The one app I actually DO want to work)</div>
<div>Sport</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and the list goes on...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now do you guys think this could maybe be a permission related? I can't think that it has to do with the internet&nbsp;because&nbsp;I can access</div>
<div>the internet from the desktop and some Metro UI Apps do work. How come other apps don't???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help I really want this issue to be fixed&nbsp;because&nbsp;then I will love Windows 8 110%. Thus far this is the only issue I have had with Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div>Rohan</div>
<div><br />

            No,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the apps..&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if it works great..</div>
<div>Right click on the apps from all apps,&nbsp;</div>
<div>click uninstall</div>
<div>Go to store and re-install the apps again&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Run Network adapter troubleshooter&nbsp;</div>
<div>Swipe to Charms bar,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click on search,&nbsp;</div>
<div>click on troubleshooting after you search with "Troubleshooting"<br />
Click on Network Adapter&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This should solve the issue.</div>

            Hello friends,<br />
<br />
it might not be a big thing, it might just be a missing running service! I searched for 2 weeks and Microsoft support asked me to uninstall anti virus clients and create a new user to test apps without success. Then I found out that the apps that worked on
 my PC have the right to access local or company network and the internet, but only the once allowed to use the local network also did their job. Apps allowed to use the interet connection only should work but did not.<br />
<br />
Then found some work arounds on the Internet using Fiddler for analysing the network connections of the apps via this route I found out that the root cause of the problem was so easy in my case:
<b>The DNS Client Service was deactivated</b><br />
<br />
<b>Activate the DNS Client Service, start it manually and switch it to run automatically in future</b> and it might be that also on your computer all the apps will work fine in future!<br />
<br />
Here I found the answer and how to fix the problem: <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w8itpronetworking/thread/50cd8300-3691-4d0a-b9d3-764b20b4839c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I have the exact issue you do. I upgraded from windows 7 64 bit&nbsp;to windows 8 64 bit and I have the same list of working/not working apps that you have. I have tried nearly everything I can think of to remedy the issue for almost a week, and no solution of
 my own or on the internet has helped. I refuse to do a fresh install and blow away all my installed windows 7 apps. I have read of several users that resorted to this to get all their Metro apps working. Keeping my legacy apps&nbsp;was the entire reason I chose&nbsp;to
 upgrade&nbsp;and not do a clean install in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you discovered a solution to this issue yet that is not destructive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my old apps work fine, including all my games and development tools. I can&nbsp;use both desktop and metro IE10 all day long. One of the strangest things is I can use the XBOX SmartGlass app to control my xbox but I can't use the Games metro app to login
 to my LIVE account over the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another oddity is I reverted back to my local account as a test, and every single metro app told me I was using the built in local administrator account and refused to start. It's been many years since I created my admin account, but I'm pretty sure it is
 NOT the locally supplied admin account. I know this account can't be used to run Metro apps. Regardless, when I switched it back to my LIVE account the original issues remained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at work as I write this and I have not yet had a chance to try the DNS client service solution posted above. I will post to this thread again after I try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home now and I also had this service disabled. I'm pretty sure I did not do that myself, but starting the service fixed all my issues.</p>

            <p>I ran into the same problem and I discovered that the DNS Client Service was not running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify that the DNS Client Service is running:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>From the start screen search for "Command Prompt" </li><li>Run the command prompt</li><li>type in "services.msc"</li><li>find DNS Client in the list</li><li>right click on it and check its properties</li><li>Startup Type should be Automatic</li><li>Press the Start button under Service Status to start the service</li></ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Same problems. Some default apps like Weather don't work.
<div><br />
<div>Xbox Games apps doesn't work and Wordmant doesn't work (cannot connect &nbsp;to Internet).</div>
<div>On the other hand Pinball FX and other Live games work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried firewall, Fiddle, proxy solutions, probe registry settings and everything else I've found on the net. No working solutions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suspect &nbsp;this problem is related to using Huawei 3G modem to connect to internet, and W8 somehow not identifying this as a proper internet connection.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot my windows, repair it and even can&#39;t perform a new clean install.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys, So I have been having this problem on HP laptop for last 3 4 days. I cannot get windows to load.
</p>
<p>Its stuck at preparing automatic repairs. After that there's black screen.</p>
<p>Sometimes it goes to diagnosing you system. It again goes to black screen.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can see my mouse in these black screens. and sometimes i get Blue screen of death.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Solutions I have tried are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get into Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>I press F11 on boot to get in to Recovery environment. I shows a HP logo with loading screen. Then all black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried using my recovery flash drive. But it shows HP Logo plus loading then goes to a blank blue screen with cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried doing a clean install of windows 7 using a bootable USB drive. It starts with windows is loading files screen. The Its stuck at loading windows screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm all out of ideas any advice would be greatly helpfull. I dont know how can i fix computer when i cant get into windows or recovery enviorment to start.</p>

<p>Well I fixed it. I'm gonna post the solution just in case if anyone is having the same problem as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was caused by corrupt hard drive.</p>
<p>So download as ISO of your installed OS. make a bootable USB.&nbsp;<br />
Boot using this USB. Then go into repair the computer option instead of installing new windows.<br />
Them from there open CMD. Use disk part commant to clean the hard drive and format it to NTFS.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<h2>            &#34;Save As&#34; in Windows 10 won&#39;t show shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7, if I had just completed a document (ex. MS Word file), and then I went to "Save As . . ." file, I could search folders, and while searching, I could click on Windows shortcuts that I had previously made to take me to a specific subfolder where
 I could save the file I just created. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, when I do the same thing, the file explorer no longer shows the Windows shortcuts, just folders and files.&nbsp; This forces&nbsp;me to navigate through the file structure to get to my intended location for the file I am saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a step backwards with Windows 10, compared to Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting change I can make somewhere that will display the shortcuts when I am doing this?&nbsp;

</p><p>I just sent about an hour preparing a response to you, answering all of your question and putting screenshots in it to illustrate the issue.&nbsp; And after I had them all in, when I went to submit the response, your BBS system here rejected it because it said
 I was trying to put in two&nbsp;many characters (it said something like several hundred thousand, which I certainly didn't type . . . it must have been reading the embedded screenshots as large quanties of characters).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to find me a way to get the information to you, by attaching a pdf file or&nbsp;something like that.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I will rebuild the response.&nbsp; But I'm not going to waste more time trying to get this Microsoft Community system to work as good as many other
 bulletin board systems are that can handle illustrations and photos easily. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or just respond to the problem I described in my earlier post.&nbsp; It is clearly written.

<p>
</p><p>I checked Word 2010 in Windows 10. Open / Save As dialog shows folder shortcuts just fine.</p>

<p>You can see there is a "Windows - Shortcut" file listed.</p>
<p>

            <p>This issue seems to be specific to 2003 with Windows 10. Workaround is to choose "All files" in the types list box.</p>

            <p>That looks like a reasonable workaround for now.&nbsp; I even tried just typing in one * and it showed the shortcuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I think&nbsp;Windows 10 should get fixed (updated) to allow the 2003 Office work products to&nbsp;work in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 2003&nbsp;works with this function in all previous Windows versions, so something must have changed or been missed when&nbsp;Windows 10 was
 put together, that broke this functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;That isn't a feature, that is a mistake.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10&nbsp;is&nbsp;a new operating system, so one would expect problems like this, but also one would expect that they&nbsp; fixed as time went on.&nbsp; Few users will be looking at this website to learn about a workaround, but lots of users of 2003 (cited by many to
 be the best Office version ever) would benefit. </p>

<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, using Office 2003, if you do a "Save as" to store a file, it will present Windows Shortcuts, and if you click on one, it will take you to that location.&nbsp; This is helpful when you want to regularly store a file in a&nbsp;complex folder location.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10,&nbsp;using Office 2003, if you do a "Save as" for a file, by default, it will not show any Windows Shortcuts.&nbsp; If you search for a file with an asterisk, it will show the shortcuts.&nbsp; But unfortunately, it will&nbsp;not do anything if you click on the
 shortcut.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>In the other thread, someone reported that&nbsp;Office 10 using Windows 10 does not have that problem, that the links are visible and active when doing a Save As.</p>

<p>If you do a "Save As" as described in office 2003 and select the shortcut that displays --- IT REPLACES THE SHORTCUT ON THE DESKTOP WITH THE FILE! &nbsp;(don't do this!). &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>I see that the dvd drive does not read cd. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Which fixit did you run?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p><span>Run this fixit and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>Fix problems with CD or DVD drives that can‚Äôt read or write media:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The
<b>SFC /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>

<p>I have tried to update all drivers and it does not fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not run Method 4 since i have&nbsp; a current AntiVirus program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know if any of these affect the CD/DVD drive or what function they have. Any recommendations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you </p>

            <p>Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have solved my problem. The Sony CD/DVD drive DW-Q58A had a mechanical problem. I found a drive to switch and test and that solved the problem. I am told that there may be two heads in the drive and the one that reads the CD may have been faulty. I appreciate
 all of the help from everyone. I dont know what the actual problem was but a new DVD drive works for me.</p>

                    My primary screen is to the right of my secondary screen. How can I stop my desktop icons from moving over to the secondary display (left) after rebooting?

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows stacks icons in columns on the left side of the desktop. But you're not stuck with that arrangement. You can move an icon by dragging it to a new
 place on the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To unlock the icons so that you can move them again:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click an empty area of the desktop.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>View</strong></span>, and then click <span>
<strong>Auto Arrange</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> to clear the check mark next to it.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro, Installed Enterprise, Reset back to factory, cannot update to 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am attempting to update to 8.1 through the Store but can not get the update to appear.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sortof seems like the Surface Pro still believes it is Enterprise even though I completed a factory reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>I previously upgraded my Surface Pro to enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, with the release of 8.1 I decided to do a reset to factory settings expecting that I would be back to Windows 8 Pro and able to do the 8.1 update through the store like normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First problem I had was that the factory&nbsp;reset could not find the media.</p>
<p>"Insert Media - Some files are missing.&nbsp; Your Windows installation or recovery media will provide these files."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got past this issue by using diskpart to assign a drive letter to recovery partition then run the following command:</p>
<p>reagentc.exe /setosimage /path D:\RecoveryImage /target C:\Windows /index 1</p>
<p>reference:&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/surface-pro-128gb-restorereset-does-not-see/a51a4a50-1eaf-485c-9dec-74d975652a5f?msgId=16578135-013b-4ea7-b15e-d7544fe8202c&amp;page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/surface-pro-128gb-restorereset-does-not-see/a51a4a50-1eaf-485c-9dec-74d975652a5f?msgId=16578135-013b-4ea7-b15e-d7544fe8202c&amp;page=2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now it appears that I am back to factory, Settings shows Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I proceed to install all updates, verify that firmwares are OK in devices, verify that KB 2871389 is installed, but cannot get 8.1 to appear n store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done a couple more factory resets as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using direct links will open the store but only show me facebook, etc.</p>
<p>such as:&nbsp; ms-windows-store:WindowsUpgradeocid=GA81_O_WOL_Hero_Buy_81Update_Null_01</p>
<p>or ms-windows-store:WindowsUpgrade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It almost seems that my Surface still thinks it is Enterprise, even after the factory reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            <p>I did this exact thing ,&nbsp; got the same messages as&nbsp;&nbsp; you did.&nbsp;&nbsp; I opted to revert using my USB recovery drive instead of the recovery option on the surface.&nbsp; It worked fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Only problem I see moving forward is 8.1 doesn't have the ability to create a recovery USB drive.....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was kind of hoping to get the recovery partition updated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thank you!&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very interesting but unfortunately I do not have a USB&nbsp;recovery drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the enterprise upgrade killed the ability to create one and I didn't get around to fixing that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think I'll look in to manually creating a recovery drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; My recovery partition is intact (I didn't remove it) so maybe that will help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or perhaps now I can successfully create a USB recovery drive now that I have reverted back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying that next.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again, </p>

    <title>How Does Achievement Completion Percentage Work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isturbo1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Does Achievement Completion Percentage Work&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does the percentage go off the achievement score earned 1000/1000, or the number of achievements 50/50? For instance, if a retail game had just two achievements: one worth 10(G) and the other worth 990(G)... and you only obtained the single 10(G) achievement...
 would that count as 50% completion or 1%??</p>

<p>Microsoft uses the achievements as the criteria for completion, not the gamerscore. If you look at your games played on xbox.com, there will be a completion bar for gamerscore, a completion bar for achievements (i.e 45/50) and a completion percentage. The
 completion percentage is tied directly to the achievement completion bar.</p>
<p>For example, on Superman the Video game, I have 1000/1000, but I did not unlock the achievement for using a cheat code (it is a 0GS achievement). So, it says I have 17/18 achievements and only 94% completion.</p>

<p>Xbox.com uses the number of achievements to calculate the completion percentage. But if you calculated it gamerscore-wise I'd still consider that a good representation of your completion percentage. Gamerscore distribution is not always very logical and
 there's 0 point achievements, so it's not perfect. It's a matter of opinion which one is better. Taking the average of both would be pretty good, I think. But I don't really mind which one is used.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This occurs when the program you are trying to run requires the MSVCP140.dll file to be present on your computer system.&nbsp; MSVCP140.dll is a Microsoft C Runtime Library file of size around 626 KB, located in the System32 folder, and is installed by Microsoft
 Visual Studio. If any DLL file goes missing or gets corrupted, you can see such error messages on your screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind, we'd like to know:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does it only affect a specific program?</li><li>Were you able to launch this program before? </li><li>Have you tried reinstalling the program?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you have reinstalled the app the issue still persists, download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio

<p>..........</p>
<p>Hello everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>I know that Microsoft will never read this, I was just expressing my gratefulness for the Xbox brand &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Although I am young to gaming compared to the others in the Forums (what is Atari, Amiga, etc...) my love for gaming has been delivered by one brand &nbsp;--&gt;</p>
<p>Xbox</p>
<p>&lt;-- &nbsp;Yes, I enjoyed playing the Original Playstation (the console that started my interest in gaming) when my friend gave me his PS1 Collection to upgrade to his PS2 (it just came out). &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest factors that led me to go to the Original Xbox over the PS2 can be described in 3 words &nbsp;--&gt;</p>
<p>Halo: Combat Evolved &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;--- &nbsp;Halo: Combat Evolved was the very first FPS game that I've ever played &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>The learning curve was high, but needless to say you all know which system I stuck with at this point of time LOL &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>I know that someone is reading this and probably saying to me &nbsp;--&gt; &nbsp;" For someone who cares so much about the Xbox brand, you sure do complain a lot "</p>
<p>&lt;-- &nbsp;Well, my response to that is because I love and care about the Xbox brand &nbsp;:) &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One is only 2 years old and it still has a long life span ahead of it, I am looking forward to seeing what other games come out for it &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>I enjoyed playing Mario Kart (Wii) with the present that was given to me, but my interest in that console (Nintendo Wii) didn't last too long &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I am not hating on the Nintendo brand and Wii, please understand this. &nbsp;It just isn't for me.</p>
<p>I am really happy for those that love the Nintendo consoles &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I don't do the whole " superiority complex " of the Xbox vs Wii vs Playstation because that is pointless. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You SHOULD be buying the console that makes you happy, NOT the console that is going to make you fit into whatever crowd you wish to join because you think it is the way to go &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Also, I will admit to the following &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>The Wii has the following games on it &nbsp;--&gt;</p>
<p>(1) Monster High: 13 Wishes</p>
<p>(2) Monster High: Skulltimate Roller Maze</p>
<p>&lt;-- &nbsp;These are very appealing to me LOL :)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>I say Microsoft does come on here. They do have moderators on here (I guess they're authorized by Microsoft to moderate and have some admin privileges). And they have engineers who make changes to this site from time to time. And they have Official Support
 Staff on here too. And they do own this site so I doubt they've "abandoned" their own property.
</p>
<p>I think it's a great idea too Lei. They're already known worldwide for making operating systems (Windows) which run the majority of PC's in the world. They acquired Skype and Minecraft which are also very popular. And Xbox too. I'm excited they've shown
 a keen interest in Minecraft too. I also like Halo, Zoo Tycoon, Kinect, Kinect Sports Rivals, Screamride, Forza 6, voice messaging, and how they're approachable through Xbox Support (they generally send a feedback form via email after contacting them) and
 through the official feedback site. It may not be always perfect, but nothing is always perfect. I've only been with Xbox since late 2010. I like it so much that it can be addicting, even staying up past my bed time or rushing in the mornings. And then when
 I'm out, there's no escaping it. Xbox 360 smartglass and Xbox 1 smartglass. And this site too. And you can listen to voice messages on-this-site too. As for the Windows 10 Xbox app, It's kwl. I find your Friends List in the Xbox app updates in real time without
 having to Refresh. I like that super fast Windows 10 UI on Xbox 1, I like how I can change the dash background, I like how the console has dolby support instead of just Stereo Uncompressed sound that it had at Launch which sounded weird. Also they're a company
 you can trust with handling your personal info secure. 2 years ago, Facebook's sign-up page wasn't even encrypted. When you sign in or visit certain pages on this site, the address bar is highlighted green with a padlock. This site looks clean too. And I like
 how I can connect with people and friends around the world. And I like how genuine Xbox 360/Xbox 1 consoles aren't as susceptible to viruses as PC's are (reports of viruses on Xbox have pretty much been nil compared to PC's), and how there are no system requirements
 for games which PC versions have, cuz PC's are made in sooooo many crazy and different configurations. Xbox Live does go down, sometimes quite a bit. But the pro's out way the cons.
</p>
<p>My first console was a second hand PS2, and only had it for 2 weeks then no longer wanted. My 2nd was Xbox 360 slim console which I've had since late 2010, and my 3rd is Xbox 1 Day 1 console with Kinect which I went to the midnight launch for. Also thanks
 for making Xbox a personal and fun and likeable experience. </p>
<p>Late 2010, I was deciding to get PS or Xbox. PS may have the superior tech, but Microsoft has the software expertise and a really good online service which is why many have Xbox.
</p>
<p>I viewed some YouTube videos of Microsoft's CEO. "Creating these magical experiences" and "potential" "opportunity" "impact" "play more" "to get more out of every moment of their life is what we want to get focused on" "the do more company" And I think it's
 reflected in Xbox and Windows 10, and why they acquired Skype and Minecraft. They create software on PCs (Windows OS and Office software like Word etc) which helps us be productive in a digital/software driven world, and Xbox/Skype/Minecraft etc for us to
 enjoy during our free time. I watched a video Head of Xbox, at the 2015 geekwire summit and a video of when the Head of Xbox acquired Xbox and when they announced Phil as Head of Xbox. I think they want to provide a good free time experience for users as well.
 I think he's kinda kwl too. </p>

<p>Off topic: but my gut instincts tell me that, Allbeit Unofficially, they (MS) read these forums every day. Inculding some on MS's BOD from time to time.
</p>
<p>It's a wise policy to claim otherwise, but if you, the consumer, had the means by which to track their every move online. You would be amazed at how many times they descretely probe these very forums for both negative as well as positive info/feedback.

 that post here. &nbsp; &nbsp;Let's hope the Sony execs don't cotton on or the brand is finished.....</p>

<p>I would love to see a Rollercoaster Tycoon on the 360. We need more games like it on the system. Tropico is really fun, but it doesn't compare to the Rollercoaster Tycoon games.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hell, I will one up you. I want to see Theme Park(I always thought it was better than RCT) and Theme Hospital revived and released on current gen consoles. Love those games. Still play Hospital regularly.</p>

<h2>            Cant view DNG files in windows explorer.</h2>
                    
<p>I use a Canon EOS 500D for all my photos which are managed in adobe Bridge; processed in Adobe CS4. When looking at RAW images which are stored as DNG's in My Pictures (pre processing into JPEG's) they are not recognised and unopenable in windows. Only readable
 in Bridge. HAve microsoft produced a codec to allow them to be viewable in Explorer???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>The current one only lists Vista, but I believe it works for 32-bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>Adobe has not released a 64-bit DNG codec, but if you search the web, there are other 3rd party ones. The price one most is fairly small. For example, this one is $10

<h2>            Why Is It Saying Trial Version &#40;Euro 2012&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Basically I Downloaded It, And Purchased It, And It won't let me go online and it says I need to purchase it, I go to The fifa store and it says I own both the trial and full game, and also, isnt this an officially licensed product, as it keeps stating,
 which is why I wander who the hell all the players are in the welsh squad???<br />
<br />
??? Strange.</p>

<p>Tried the cache thing. It comes up saying "Loading Hospitality settings" then asks me whether I want ingame or server settings. Choose either of them and my whole xbox freezes. Won't let me go to the guide or nothing.

<p>Once again thanks for coming back to me. It has not solved the problem. When I turned the computer on today it posted a note saying the file was corrupt and did not match the computer sam or something like that.</p>
<p>could the fact that I am using office 2010 have a bearing?</p>
<p>should i reinstall windows update?</p>
<p>grateful for any help before I decide to get rid of my computer</p>

<p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this is due to corrupted Windows Update components. Let's try to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.
<span>This is done to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts of an update or when you run a program in Windows. Check this

<p>

    <title>Windows home premium for refurbished pc COA does not state weather it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hanketron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows home premium for refurbished pc COA does not state weather it is 64 0r 32bit version</h2>
                    <p>I bought a refurbished hp 5750 (for my brother in law) and I do not know weather&nbsp; the processor or the operating system is 32 or 64 bit.&nbsp; The hard drive died and the computer will not boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no recovery partition or hard drive to crack into and
 find the info and I have no recovery disk.&nbsp; I bought the machine from Walmart on line selling it for Circuit City and finding out what was replaced and what version the OS is has been time consuming, frustrating and so far fruitless.&nbsp; Is there a way to find
 out the version from your COA (certificate of authenticity/little sticker on the side) product key or one of the other 3 number/letter combinations listed on it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the title only says&nbsp; "Windows Home Premium for Refurbished PCs"&nbsp;&nbsp; As often as hard drives die, I would think there an easy way to find this out.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes, I know I should have made a recovery disc but stupidly&nbsp; I was waiting for the upgrade
 to Windows 10 thinking 10 would solve all my back up problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your time and consideration</p>

            This computer meets all requirements for 10 and 7 will load on a new hard drive. Most of these computers, hp5750, came with 64bit processors but not all and I can't get an answer from hp, ciruit city or walmart on what processor came with my refurbished
 computer....it may have been swapped out. &nbsp; I just need to know which version my COA applies too, but thanks for your thoughts anyway canadian tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I got it, After downloading a ultimate windows 7 (labeled 64 and 32bit) ISO, burning it to DVD and then installing it and then updating and registering with windows, I have the computer back.&nbsp; Not sure why 7 works as it does, but I think all installations
 of 7 cover the 64/32 need and the installation works out which you have.&nbsp; That may be why they didn't print the info on the COA.&nbsp; Mine turned out to be a 64 bit version after all was finished.&nbsp; I now have my upgrade to 10 icon and am about ready to enter the
 new 10 world.</p>
<p>

<p>Contrary to what you may read elsewhere, you do <strong>NOT </strong>need to regularly update your drivers, particularly printer drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if you do want to update a printer driver (because (a) you know that the new version fixes a specific problem you have or (b) you know that the new version adds a feature that you want or need), you should ONLY get the updated driver from the printer
 manufacturer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only circumstance for which you should get a printer driver from Windows Update is when no driver is available from the printer manufacturer for your edition of Windows (which is, unfortunately, becoming more common).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your subject line is accurate and the update in question is coming from Windows Update, right-click it (in the list of Windows Updates) and select "Hide Update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For curiosity only, what is the specific model of your HP printer and what is the KB number of the update?</p>

 it doesn‚Äôt work. When I restart the computer in safe mode, the user sign in page showed a sihost.exe warning: ‚ÄúUnkown Hard Error‚Äù and when I continued signing in, there was only a blank screen with some windows warning about something being moved or deleted
 ( It mentioned something about local system 32, I apologize for not recording down the rest of the message). The Windows+X key to open command prompt didnt seem to be able to open command prompt, so I proceeded to opening Windows NT and profile list, but there
 were no duplicated files and and the file with the most longest name ( had a 21 in the front part) was the only one with the RefCount and State set to a non-0 value. As the procedure didnt work, I retried putting my computer into safe mode, but now it seems
 to be stuck in a completely blank screen with the mouse and it is not responding to any command i put in. For some reason, Mcafee popups still appear as if it was still the desktop, but thats the only feature the blank screen seems to have. Please help me...
 I recently installed a non-factory installed SSD unto it, could that be the cause if the problem? ( though I have been using it with no problem until the reboot)</p>

<h2>            ASUS x553ma windows 10. apparently with Bluetooth 4.0, but nowhere to be found.</h2>
                    I got this ASUS X553MA with windows 10 and was pretty stoked to see it had bluetooth options...... on paper. nowhere in my computer have i been able to find such bluetooth settings. ive tried EVERYTHING!!! and i mean EVERYTHING!!! at first i wasnt even
 seeing the bluetooth icon in my "action centre", then i couldnt see it in my "device manager" list. i managed to find what i thought was the correct bluetooth driver, its showing up in my "device manager" but i still have no icon in my "action centre" and
 no bluetooth settings available and &nbsp;im going crazy. ASUS says its got a WLAN/BT combo drive so ive tried unistalling and reinstalling anything having to do with both Bluetooth and WLAN but still nothing.....<br />
<br />
im starting to think im as dumb as bricks and theres actually no Bluetooth capability on this..........<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We&nbsp;understand the inconvenience caused and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the Bluetooth drivers from the manufacturer website from the link provided below&nbsp;and install the same and check for status. If the issue still persists, I suggest you to contact the manufacturer for driver support as the computer
 is bought recently, it will be under warranty.</p>

<p>This will end your annoyance.</p>
<p>I can categorically tell you that THERE IS NOT ANY BLUETOOTH IN THIS LAPTOP.</p>
<p>It's an urban myth.</p>
<p>You need to buy BLUETOOTH ADAPTOR USB-BT400 by ASUS.</p>
<p>Prices vary massively, but i paid ¬£10 for mine in CURRYS.</p>
<p>Ridiculous, i know, but problem solved, even if you will lose a USB port.</p>
