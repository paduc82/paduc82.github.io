<p>Another classic waste of time by Microsoft's idiot support staff! The are NO error messages, and the problem persists no matter what setting UAC is on — other than total shutoff. Still this inept support imbecile could not grasp the issue.&nbsp;</p>

            I have researched this issue and there appears to be no resolve from Microsoft. &nbsp;I am having the same issue as the other 4 parties. &nbsp;I would have been unaware if it wasn't my McAffe Security was invalidated and I am unable to reinstall it. &nbsp;Oddly this
 seams to only be on my Dell Desktop and not on any HP's I have. &nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t download anything on Chrome, IE, Firefox or Safari</h2>
                    Starting from Thursday night I have no been able to download anything onto my laptop, I had to uninstall my World of Warcraft game due to a bug, and when I went to install it back the page wouldn't load, the download didn't begin, and I was redirected
 5 minutes later to a page saying "Web page is not available". Then on Friday I accidentally uninstalled my Ubisoft game launcher and when going onto the website to install it back, again, the page didn't load. I then switched to Firefox and got to the page,
 however it redirected me to a totally different page, I also tried Safari and IE and neither of the download pages would load. I also then uninstalled Steam thinking maybe I could go back and download it again and perhaps get my game launcher back, however
 I was very wrong. I tried downloading on all my browsers with the same result each time. I've done virus and malware scans, nothing seems to be wrong, I reinstalled Windows 8, I still am having the problem, and am quite annoyed. When

            <p>Thank you for replying, I went into safe mode, and ended up just resetting it to factory settings, and the problem is now fixed and I am free to download again! But to answer your questions; the problem wasn't only just for my games, it was for everything,
 including the virus scan you advised me to download. -Also, to answer your questions; Yes, I did have software protection; AVG, Malewarebytes and McAfee, I uninstalled them, thinking they were preventing me from downloading, but the problem still persisted,
 and actually, I think I answered the other two questions in the beginning of my reply.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Slow internet speed after Anniversary Update of Windows 10</h2>
                    I updated Windows 10 with the Anniversary updated earlier this week. &nbsp;Upon initial startup, my internet speed is very low compared to what I had been getting. &nbsp;I connect through a router. &nbsp;The only way to correct this so far is that I have to restart my
 computer and then the speeds are normal. &nbsp;Some setting seems to have been changed with the update. &nbsp;Any idea why I have to restart my computer each time.(I don't have to reboot the router)

            <p>I connect by Ethernet to my router. &nbsp;Here is exactly what happens since the Anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I boot up my computer and router just like I always do. &nbsp;I have a 1 GB connection. &nbsp;When everything has booted up, all things look normal and I am connected to the internet. &nbsp;However, I am only getting anywhere from 6-10 MB in terms of speed. &nbsp;At this point,
 I do a restart of my computer(not my router). &nbsp;Once my computer has restarted, my internet speeds are back to normal. &nbsp;I have had to do this only since the Anniversary update.</p>

            Same problem here. As expected Microsoft asks you to post a bunch of error logs without actually giving any solution. If this is the headache that I have to go through after every big windows 10 update, I was much better off with windows 7...

            <p>I have the same problem with the AU on 4 different computers. </p>
<p>We are talking about a 200'000 Kbit/s Connection to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So downloads from a perfomant server like: </p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/mirrors/opensource-dvd/opensource-cd/os_spiele_46.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">&nbsp;http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/mirrors/opensource-dvd/opensource-cd/os_spiele_46.iso</span></a>&nbsp;were
 done with a Speed of 23.5 MB/s on all computers - no matter if they were connected via cable or WiFi. One of the computers is a brandnew Surface!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade to the AU on ALL 4 Computers the download rate was less then half -&gt;9.5 MB/s, no matter which browser I used (Chrome,Edge,IE,FF).</p>
<p>The speedtest though was showing the correct speed of 200'000 Kbit/s at all times</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to version 1511 and -&gt; the downloadrate was up to 23.5 MB/s again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Pictures:</p>

<h2>            System Image Fail</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp;
<div>I have recently reinstalled Windows 7 Ultimate onto my son's Computer. This was originally set up as 32 bit, and the&nbsp;re installation&nbsp;is 64 bit. This has caused all sorts of issues over the last few days, updating drivers and software so there are no conflicts.&nbsp;Eventually&nbsp;we
 sorted all these little problems out, but because it has been an effort, we thought it would be a good idea to back&nbsp;this&nbsp;up, and create a system image. We have tried several times, and installed many windows updates to try to get this to work. We even got
 a Hotfix from the MS&nbsp;Support&nbsp;pages, but as this wasn't exactly for this&nbsp;OS, it's not working either. The message we get is:</div>
<div>A Volume Shadow Copy Service operation failed. Please check "VSS" and "SPP" application event logs for more information. (0x807800A1)</div>
<div>Additional Information:</div>
<div>The writer experienced a non-transient error. If the backup process is retried, the error is likely to reoccur. (0x800423F4)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            Hi Srimadhwa,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. I have completed your suggestions but&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;they make little difference. Here's what happened:</div>
<div>Method 1: All the services (Including the&nbsp;dependents) started and are listed as Automatic.</div>
<div>Method 2: I disconnected from the internet and disabled the Firewall and anti virus, then tried to run Create System Image again. The same error reports.</div>
<div>Method 3: I ran check disk and the computer had to be restarted (run from boot as C drive was in use). I then tried the process again: same error message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally I have checked the event log. There are two VSS logs at the time of the last test. The first is Event 12290 and was listed as a level of "Warning". Report as follows....</div>

<p>First of all<span>&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter</span>&nbsp;from Control Panel&gt;Troubleshooting&gt;Audio Playback.</p>
<p><strong>If it does not help,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;see if any output device is not disabled.To check this open playback devices&gt;Right click on any Empty area and check Disabled devices:<br />

I've been trying for over 2 weeks to fix the problem of my emails syncing to my windows phone and have been unsuccessful. It's driving me crazy. I went to the AT&amp;T store, that was a waste of time, I called tech support, that was a waste of time. Now I'm being
 told I have to drive out to a Microsoft facility in BFE and have them look at it. I need help ASAP!!!

<h2>            VPN Error 800 &#38; 807 unable to connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have Small Business Server 2011 Standard and we have a VPN setup which was working fine up untill last week when all of a sudden all users now get the following Error 800.&nbsp; I've also tried setting my client machine to use PPTP as the VPN type rather than
 Auto to get a more specific error message which is Error 807.&nbsp; Please see below;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f197468" /></p>
<p>- I have checked and added all the relevent ports to the router firewall and when I check the router log it does show that the requests are coming through and being passed onto the server.</p>
<p>- I've tried using various workstations with different operating systems and I am able to ping the server.&nbsp; So the issue doesn't seem to be from the client side.</p>
<p>- I have tried to run the diagnostic option shown in the above image but as always that did not come back with anything.</p>
<p>- I have tried to also disable the firewalls of the client and the server but this still didn't work.</p>
<p>- The router for the server is a Netgear DG834.</p>
<p>So I am now baffled as to why this has stopped working.&nbsp; Please help if you can.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. Aria.</p>

<p>Guys, I have finally managed to sort the issue by;</p>
<p>1. Going to Routing &amp; Remote Access</p>
<p>2. Right clicking on the local server I need VPN access to and going to properties.</p>
<p>3. On the Security tab although all the settings were correct I set them as another setting, clicked ok then went back into the security tab and set them back to the normal setting, in my case; Authentication method MS-CHAP 2, untick IPSEC &amp; HTTP and set
 certificate as default.</p>
<p>4. Once I did that I also reset the client machines VPN setting to conform to the server settings.</p>
<p>5. Finally I rebooted the router.</p>
<p>All seems to be back to normal and working now.&nbsp; Very strange issue!&nbsp; Hope that helps someone!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Sound auto adjusts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Sound auto adjusts&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I upgraded to windows 10, I noticed my volume has been getting louder, and its been raising itself on its own. For example, if I'm watching a youtube video, and I pause, then un-pause it will be a lot louder. But if I click on my speaker settings
 it says its still at 35, and if I try to adjust the volume by just 1%, it will dramatically decrease. So the volume increases, but it doesn't show it.

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the Audio/Sound card drivers in compatibility mode and check if it works for you.This is to check if this is caused due to driver/software compatibility issues.
</p>
<p>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to install driver in compatibility mode, the steps for Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.

<h2>            High Memory Usage, I Can&#39;t Find the Culprit, Isn&#39;t There Something That Does That Type of Thing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got a high memory thing going on, 75% with a browser + a couple of tabs + not much else (that I know of!) + identifying the cause is seemingly beyond me. Not being a 'pc guy' this didn't surprise me, what did was I was ever having to look for it
 myself, isn't a computer good at that sort of thing? I've always thought pc's are far too user dependent + he has to involve himself in ways that seem to me to be outside of reasonable expectation. If, for example, Msoft did satellite TV they'd have the customer&nbsp;
 up a ladder + on the roof&nbsp; installing the dish, I'm sure they would.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I was, therefore, hoping for a ''hands-off'' type of solution, as much as possible, a solution of any description is the main priority, though, all I've come across so far involves turning things off + disabling them, which is a trade-off more than a solution.
 An app, or some funky little tool that will fix the issue, as opposed to depriving me of a part of my system, that's what I'm hoping for + is why I'm here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'll leave it in your capable hands + hopefully hear back from someone bearing good news, soon. That hasn't been my usual experience of support requests, here or anywhere else, but hope springs eternal, as they say.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;All the best,</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; managed to make a fair drama out of getting the 2 files you requested, + the link which is above, hopefully I didn't make a pig's ear of anything + it's all as you would expect.</p>

<p>&nbsp; All the best to you, Sir, I'm much obliged.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just got a reminder email, quite appropriate I'd say, as I'd forgotten all about my question + the fact I supplied you with the information you wanted, as far as I'm aware I did, anyway. I'd have to say I'm intrigued as to what happened, did you
 manage to get the files I stuck in OneDrive?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Let me know, if you would?</p>

<p><span><span>The problem probably starts with the limited amount of installed RAM, i.e., only 2gb on a 64 bit system. You can install a maximum of 8 gb on your Toshiba Satellite L640 computer but
 this would involve some expense.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>What is happening is that you have an ever increasing demand for memory from the time you boot until the computer is shutdown. The process starts again when you reboot.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You have installed Rizone Memory Booster. I am extremely doubtful about this type of software and would not encourage any user to install it. It is known that that third party memory

<p>I'm with you. &nbsp;I wish I was a xbox preview member so I can get early access to the Halo 5 beta. &nbsp;It's so frustrating seeing some of my friends play this game, but I do not get to at all until later. &nbsp;I got an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** last month showing
 I have been with xbl since 2006, and that I am in the top 1 % of players for number of hours gamed. &nbsp;My total hours was 2710 at the time, and I would say half of those or a quarter are from Halo 2 and Halo 3. &nbsp;My Gamerscore and achievements was in the top
 5 % . &nbsp;</p>
<p>After all of that, I still didn't get an invite to be part of xbox preview or Halo 5 beta access. I feel completely disrespected for not being part of this exclusive program and invitation after all of the time I have put into gaming.</p>

<p>I don't know about some people - but for me I just had to sign up. &nbsp;About a year about Major Nelson tweeted about it and then it was on every video game website I saw. &nbsp;It was a link and you could just sign up. &nbsp;About a month later I got an email saying
 I was part of the program and I've been getting the advanced dashboard updates ever since.</p>
<p>It wasn't 'invite only' - it was 'sign up here'. &nbsp;I don't remember what the link was at all, but if you google it you may be able to find it.</p>

    <title>No Sound in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinyry  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sound in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Erm, hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if this question was already asked and answered, but I kind of want a easy description on what I should do for my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I updated my PC to Windows 10. Everything, after a while, went out smoothly. However, I realized that the sound isnt working. Well, mostly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, my PC's front audio (for headphones) ports work, to an extent. The sound is all distorted, voices can be barely heard while the background music is loud and somewhat clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within playback devices, it's showing that my speakers, my PC's back audio ports, are "not plugged in" and don't work, whether it be speakers or headphones plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some searching around, my only guess is an audio driver or something isnt working. So after troubleshooting my PC within "View Devices and Printers," it says that no driver is installed for Multimedia Audio Controller. Well, when I try to fix it via
 troubleshoot, it comes up with nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So my question is, how do I fix this and get my sound back? Is it the Multimedia Audio Controller issue that is the problem? Or is it something else entirely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC Tower is custom made and was given to me, so I dont know have much of a clue what parts are in it besides the processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I know this doesnt sound much of a "windows" problem... but the sound worked fine until I updated to Windows 10...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>es gibt ja unterschiedliche Versionen von dem alten, nicht mehr produzierten Lenkrad. Weiß jemand, woran man erkennen kann welche Version man da gerade in der Hand hat? Vielleicht weiß auch jemand, ob und welche Unterschiede es gibt.</p>
<p>Danke!</p>

<p>Welche genauen Unterschiede es bei der alten Version gibt, weis ich leider nicht. Vieleicht sind diese Infos trotzdem ganz interessant. Im November 2006 kam das gute Stück auf den Markt und im November 2007 gab es dann eine limited edition mit PGR 3 als
 Zusatzinhalt. </p>

<p>Sorry, umgekehrt. Das Lenkrad wurde von Anfang an mit einer speziellen PGR3 Version ausgeliefert. Leute die PGR3 aber kein Lenkrad hatten, bekamen das Update als Titleupdate.</p>
<p>Nach 2007 war PGR3 dann nicht mehr enthalten. </p>

<h2>            msconfig stuck on selective startup</h2>
                    when i open the msconfig, its stuck on selective startup and when i select normal startup, the apply button is grayed out. when i press ok and open it again, it goes back to selective startup. the issue is that i have everything in selective startup checked
 (even the things in the tabs) and some programs don't launch on startup. For example, i get a msi usb speed up error "the api was not found" everytime i start my computer. Before i had this problem, it was in normal startup. i had a problem with my computer
 and had to set up remote session with a microsoft support representative, and i think he did something to make the computer not load anything on startup and now its stuck in selective.

<p>Contact "microsoft support live chat" again. Their techs caused (or at least exacerbated)&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem so they'll need to fix it. [1]</p>
