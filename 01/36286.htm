<h2>            After 1803 Win10 installs things without user consensus</h2>
                    At each Win 10 update, the user have to&nbsp;fight to defend its privacy and freedom. My windows 10 Pro is already in Italian and now I received a notification that the "italiano pacchetto esperienze locali" has been installed (about 64MiB): Why this without
 my consensus to install it? and worse I have to resort to&nbsp;third-party software to uninstall it...

<p>This is actually component of Windows and it is to enhance your user experience, instead of taking much space during install , it will be install after everything is set.</p>

<p>"<span>instead of taking much space during install , it will be install after everything is set</span>" : this is wrong. Or it is a Windows component and so installed with the OS or it isn't and MUST not be installed without
 user OK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I have uninstalled it and my OS is still working without problems from this point of view... The interface language is still in italian as before and as it was since I upgraded to Win 10 in July 2016. So really is it "<span>actually&nbsp;</span><span>component
 of Windows</span>"? What would it mean "<span>it is to enhance your user experience</span>"? I already have all what I need without that package...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, explain the usefulness of that package.. maybe I could reinstall it.</p>
<p>

            I believe this package contains things like advance dictionary and additional language or characters and update to language. It won't bring you any harm and like Windows Update it is to improve your experience. &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>It DOES! Just now Windows has re-downloaded and installed that package without any advise and it really breaks my system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Without that package my Windows is in Italian and I, having an US keyboard, have also an icon on the tool bar with which I can switch between the Italian (IT) and US keyboard. The icon is ITA over US;&nbsp; just pressing
 SHIFT-CTRL I can do the switch. This is sometime useful when I need to type some accented letter (</span><span>SHIFT-CTRL and typing '[', the square bracket, produces 'è', the 'e' with open accent).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the "italiano pacchetto esperienze locali" is installed I lost that icon on the toolbar and&nbsp;</span><span>SHIFT-CTRL does not produce the switch: this causes a lot of trouble because
 now it is very difficult to produce accented characters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now the question is: Given my Windows is already in italian and I can switch between US and IT keyboard, how can I stop that the package is reinstalled? Usually I uninstall it with another (cleaning...) software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should give instructions to uninstall it avoiding its re-installation using Windows tools. Commandline (DOS/Powershell) is welcomed!</span></p>

            If that breaks your system, that is different story, normally it should ac like Windows Update. In your case, I suggest open start and search for feedback and open Feedback Hub app and then explain auto-install of this feature break your system and write
 what happens.

<p>I thing there is some bug in this Windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, Windows insists to reinstall the "italiano pacchetto esperienze locali" and I have left it there. The tool bar (systray) does not show the icon ITA over US and SHIFT-CTRL does not work to switch between the default US keyboard and the ITAlian keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings - Time &amp; Language - Region &amp; Language shows the "Add a language" button and below "Italiano (Italia) - Lingua di visualizzazione di Windows" : the _same_ was shown before the installation of this language package!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking&nbsp;"Italiano (Italia) - Lingua di visualizzazione di Windows" shows that only the "Options" button is enabled; clicking it shows that under "Keyboards" there are the US and, below, Italian keyboard. Now removing the Italian keyboard and re-adding it
 allows for the ITA over US icon to re-appear in the tool bar and SHIFT-CTRL works again to switch between the two keyboard layout, but only for a while or until reboot. Indeed, it disappears again, mysteriously, and SHIFT-CTRL does not work any more unless
 one repeat the game to remove and re-add the Italian keyboard as described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is really this a normal behavior?</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, it is better to report this in Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>The normal behavior would be something that won't interfere user and it just work and if it is not (based on what you explained), it is better to share this issue through Feedback Hub.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can reproduce systematically the issue of the icon and SHIFT-CTRL functionality disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click "<span>Settings - Time &amp; Language - Region &amp; Language</span>", exactly when I click in "<span>Region &amp; Language</span>" while it loads its content the ITA over US icon [1] disappears
 and SHIFT-CTRL functionality [1] to switch between the US (default) and ITAlian layout of the keyboard stops to work, just a reboot fixes these things. So... not clicking&nbsp;"<span>Region &amp; Language</span>" is OK. NOTICE the issue
 is ONLY for clicking&nbsp;"<span>Region &amp; Language</span>" NOT "Date &amp; Time" or "Speech"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is a bug how Windows handles the languages...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what regards "<span>Feedback Hub</span>" I removed it since the first time I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10... Is there a mailing list to which one can write?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively... May you flag this discussion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Angelo.</p>

<p>[1] When the&nbsp;SHIFT-CTRL works and the icon is present on the tool-bar, the icon changes in "ITA over it"</p>

<h2>            High Disk Usage with Low MB&#47;s Ammount</h2>
                    <p>For the last two weeks or so my computer has had a high Disk % usage; however, the amount of MB being used is next to none. This has obviously caused my computer to run exceedingly slow. I have tried a few reported fixes, but none have seem to have worked.
 I have tried changing the amount of virtual memory that can be used (16 gb) this had no effect. I have also tried a clean boot, this had no effect. I have tried a full scan with Norton as well is disk optimization, and temp file clean up, this had no effect
 either. I have disabled "Windows Search" process and "Supperfetch" (This was from a similar yet different problem where I had a high disk usage, but I did have a high MB% being used). I simply cannot find a fix anywhere so I have decided to ask for help from
 professionals who I assume know of some way to fix this without a clean install.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel files from pxl on pocket pc to xls in Vista</h2>
                    I recently got a new laptop with Windows Vista.&nbsp; I was using XP Pro and Active Sync with my pocket PC.&nbsp; Now, with the Windows Mobile Device Center, it's not converting the pxl extension files back to a xls format I can use with Excel.&nbsp; I update various
 spreadsheets I use between my work computer, which is running XP Pro and Active Sync and my home computer.&nbsp; What do I need to get this conversion to happen?&nbsp; I will be upgrading to Win 7 as soon as the software arrives.

            <span>To convert the .PXL files to .XLS, I suggest that you open the files on your device and save them as .XLS format. Then you can open them in Vista.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Microsoft decided to drop the .PXL converter with ActiveSync 4.x and WMDC (which probably means you'll have the same problem with Windows7).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's another reply with a similar answer but in more detail:<br />
<br />
<p>To transfer files from your PC to your any PocketPC in the .xls format, change your ActiveSync settings so it DOESN'T convert the files when you copy them to your
<span>CF card<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.intellitxt.com%2fast%2fadTypes%2f2_bing.gif" /></span>:</p>
<p>In ActiveSync select Options | Rules Tab | Conversions Settings | General Tab | UNCHECK ~ Convert files when synchronized, copied or moved. OK | OK</p>
<p>When you move the files to your CF card they will be in the .xls format. You can turn this setting on &amp; off as needed, even during the same connection session.</p>
<p>Note: you will NOT be able to open the .xls files on your PocketPC until you copy them onto a computer with ActiveSync &amp; back to your PocketPC with conversion turned ON. Though you can have a converted &amp; an unconverted copy on your PocketPC. They won't overwrite
 each other because they will have different names (.pxl &amp; .xls)</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

I hope this helps.<br />

Good luck!<br />

    <title>Added d drive but can&#39;t search for files on it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailingdreams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Added d drive but can&#39;t search for files on it</h2>
                    <p>I cloned my c: drive to an SSD and then reformatted my old c drive and added it as the d drive. Windows 10 sees the c and d drive and I can copy files to the c and d and have "Program Files" installed on both. Everything works fine except for the searching
 for files. For example, when I search for a file named "img_*" in windows explorer on c, it finds them no problem. But searching for an "img_*" file on d: doesn't work. It shows nothing eventhough I have a ton of img_* files on the disk.</p>
<p>Another strange thing I noticed is that when I click on an image on c: , I can click on the advance to next picture arrow, but on the d drive, the advance to the next picture arrow is not highlighted. Clicking on it won't take me to the next picture.</p>
<p>Its like Windows 10 can open the picture when I click on it, but not figure out that anything else exists in the folder.</p>
<p>I must have mucked something up when installing the d drive, but why would the Program Files on d not have an issue?</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what I could check would greatly be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better regarding your concern with the drives on the computer, we suggest that you create a partition&nbsp;for you to be able to do dual boot.&nbsp;Cloning the&nbsp;C: drive will allow you to copy the program files, but not the system files.&nbsp;It is the reason&nbsp;why
 it's not doing anything when you tried to search in file explorer using the&nbsp;D: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>He's not trying to dual boot. It should be obvious to anyone who can read that he transferred the OS to the SSD, formatted the HDD and added the latter as a secondary drive to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Cloning the&nbsp;C: drive will allow you to copy the program files, but not the system files.</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, do you know what cloning means? It's a 100% copy of all the data on the drive, including even the partition table.</p>

            Is there a lot of data on the HDD right now? If you can, I suggest you copy/move it all off, then right-click the Start button, open Disk Management, delete all the partitions on the HDD, create a new simple volume (partition), format it as NTFS with all
 default settings selected and see if that works properly.

            Enter "index" in the Cortana search bar.&nbsp; Select "Indexing options."&nbsp; From there you can add the D: drive to file indexing, which should cause files there to appear in searches.

            Indexing is not a prerequisite for search to work. Clearly there's some other issue here.<br />

            I agree that there's probably something else going on, but I have seen instances where making changes in indexing locations
<em>does</em> solve the problem.

            <p>This is really weird. I typed&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"index" in the Cortana search bar, opened the Indexing Options, selected the "modify" and then in the next window I selected the d: drive "change selected locations".
 When click on the box next to the d: drive, the "summary of selected locations" adds "OS (C:)". I'm letting it index to see if that helps. Hopefully JimWynne's suggestion (that's much appreciated) fixes it, but I got a feeling I've got to do what RobertJWin
 says.</span></span></p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>I thought indexing worked because it listed the file on my d drive when I used System.Filename:~= XXX. But when I right click and select open file location, it say "The file c:\my_folder_on_d_drive" is unavailable. If its a picture, when double clicking
 on it, the picture viewer says the file cannot be found. It seems even the indexing is somehow screwed up.</p>

            <p>Update: The solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish it was an easier solution, but I had to re-format the d: drive as RobertJWin suggested. Search works fine and so does the image viewer. Thanks gals/guys for your suggestions.</p>

            <p>I have tried the first recommended option, &nbsp;which made no difference, except that now during shut down of the computer I get a message asking me to terminate a program as it has an error in it.</p>
<p>Quite a time consuming procedure, &nbsp;to reboot in safe mode. &nbsp; It would be helpful for those of us that only have one computer, &nbsp;to have an option to &nbsp;EMAIL A PDF OF INSTRUCTIONS as there is no way I can memorise the long list of steps.</p>
<p>I will try option 2 when I have time to write down the long and complicated list of instructions.</p>
<p>I am on a HP Pavilion laptop, &nbsp;18 months old. &nbsp; I have a basic Idea of computers, &nbsp;I think I am an average user in that respect. &nbsp; Time &nbsp;to organize an option to &nbsp;EMAIL A PDF OF INSTRUCTIONS, then I could print it out and follow it. &nbsp; &nbsp; Thankyou for your
 reply, &nbsp;are you "WE" - it;s nice to know who one is talking too.</p>
<p>After following all the threads and links associated with the below "FIX" &nbsp;I won't waste my time on option 2.</p>
<p>Why recommend a fix that DOESN'T WORK.</p>

<h2>            Windows starting automatically after shut down</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my upgrade to Windows 10, I noticed that my PC will automatically start after I shut it down. I spoke to the Answer Desk last night to maybe try to find an answer. I was informed to maybe post a video of this event. The weird part is that I do not
 get any error messages at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my questions are...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I fix this?</p>
<p>2) How do I upload a video to provide an example of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Ben</p>

            <p>Are you sure you don't get any error messages? &nbsp; None in Event Viewer, for the date/time of the event?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is restarting after shutting down, it's probably because of something crashing or a problem hardware. Do you recall anything you installed or downloaded prior to this event occurring?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could check out this setting in your Control Panel. &nbsp; Right click on your Windows icon at bottom left of Desktop and click on Control Panel. &nbsp; Select System &amp; Security - System - Advanced System Settings - Start up &amp; Recovery Settings - untick Automatically
 Restart under System Failure. &nbsp; Hopefully, that will action will stop your computer from restarting, but it won't fix the underlying problem. &nbsp; You will have to search that out and have it rectified.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for this. I unchecked the box and it now powers off (let's hope it stays that way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually forgot about the Event Viewer. Had a look there and the error&nbsp;source is "Service Control Manager" and there is a warning "e1iexpress" as well. Should I be worried about this, or can I just ignore it and let my PC shutdown with errors and all?</p>

            <p>Sorry about the double reply - just thought I want to mention this. Before I marked everything as done/complete, I shutdown my PC a few times. Each time it worked. However, the problem still persists. I will search more on the web to see if I can come across

            I assume that your 'persistent problem' refers to the error message in Event Viewer. &nbsp; If so, and if it is any comfort, I also get a similar error message, but this occurs whenever the Network Link is disconnected when the computer goes to sleep (I have
 an Intel Adapter). &nbsp; So if that is also the case with you, I wouldn't worry about it. &nbsp; Indeed, a lot of the errors and warnings in Event Viewer can be ignored, but keep an eye on them especially when a program crashes, freezes, etc.

            <pre>No, its not OK to just delete any files especially those labeled as amd64 since those are likely import system files that make your computer function. If you want to free up space in Windows 10, here are some common places you can look.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder. 
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            It might not be a good idea, you may break your OS.
<br />A better way to clear files is by using the "Disk Cleanup Tool" that is installed with Windows. Do a search for "Disk cleanup", select folders with data in it, select "Cleanup system files".  That will be the safest way to clean up files from your system.

<h2>            Xbox PC beta audio not going through the desired drivers on every single game &#40;and thus no surround&#41;.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a logitech g933 through USB and use my G-HUB drivers for some nice dolby surround in all my games and it works wonders, yet everything sounds like bad stereo in every game launched through the xbox app or the MS store for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tested games that I already own on steam and I can without a doubt tell that the surround is working as intended on any platform that isn't the xbox app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me figure this out? I have absolutely no idea why it has been made to use some random generic audio drivers instead of the installed ones. It's really changing the audio experience by so much it makes me close to chose not to pursue paying
 for the service.</p>

            I've got no luck with the troubleshooter. The thing thinks everything works fine but it doesn't.<br />
What's absolutely astonishing is that I can hear everything else through the intended surround sound but not the game launched through the Xbox app.<br />
<br />
For instance, I can hear a youtube video in the background with the intended sound while the game is stuck in a weird generic stereo that is unpleasant.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how this can even happen? It doesn't happen anywhere else simply because there's no reason that the game goes through "another" sound channels or whatever. It feels like games played through the xbox app are "wrapped" around some software
 magic that renders the sound themselves (like 3rd party) instead of going through the usual drivers of the computer and it makes absolutely no sense. Infuriating really.

<p>UPDATE:<br />
<br />
I tested some more games and found some where the sound works as intended and surprisingly when looking inside the game files after setting the file permissions right it looks like only the games "heavily locked" have the sound problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By heavily locked I mean that the files contain some appx folders and there's a padlock icon on every file inside the game folders and you can't start the game from the .exe inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to launch these .exe it ways windows cannot access it.</p>
<p>Why would game files be completely denied access from the user at all? It might be even because of this that the drivers can't do their work on the sound of these games. It's ridiculous, no other platform does that.<br />

            There are a lot of hits on this headset and surround sound issues that affect certain channels or where the sound is coming from; for instance no sound in youtube.&nbsp; Most problems seem to be corrected with a firmware update (no version specified) that I
 could find.&nbsp; You may want to see if there is a firmware update for the headset.

<p>Yeah I know about this issues. My firmware is up to date and the sound works wonders with absolutely everything.</p>
<p>Some of the games from the xbox beta app are really the only instances of an audio malfunction on my whole system at the moment.<br />

            Unfortunately no. I didn't find anything on the web either. It's like barely anyone is aware of this issue. Might only be related to Logitech audio peripherials using drivers surround through USB.

<p>A Surface 2, like the Surface RT, run a recompiled version of Windows 8.1 to function on an ARM processor instead of Intel.&nbsp; With that, no other software can be installed except from the Store app or what is already on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has Windows Defender which is good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To date, nobody has ever really gotten a virus or malware on a "RT" machine.&nbsp; A little like a Linux version of Windows.&nbsp; Save your subscription for anti-virus software for Intel based machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These "RT" machines are actually the most secure Windows computers that exist today to include machines running Windows 10!</p>

<p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are the sound
 files adding automatically to the Windows Media player library?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you change
 any settings in the media player or add the files to the Media player before this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Music, Videos, and Pictures libraries in<span>Windows</span> point to folders that store the actual media files on your computer. The Player Library simply contains
 links to the media files, but gives you greater control of how you organize and use your digital media content than the<span>Windows</span> folders do.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-Library-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-Library-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to remove the sound files in program files folder from Windows Media player library and check if it helps. To remove items from Windows Media Player
 library, access the link below and follow the steps. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can<span><span>change the default save location</span><strong>.</strong></span> The default save location determines where an item is
 stored when it's copied, moved, or saved to the library. Access the link below to know more about how to customize a library.</span></p>

            Hi Lori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can remove the Xbox app:
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-uninstall-and-remove-the-xbox-app-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-uninstall-and-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if necessary you can repair the store to get rid of the error if it persists:
<br />I'll give you everything possible to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Wow,&nbsp; That is some list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't think I can do too much with this tonight but I appreciate your speedy response.&nbsp; If the links you're directing me to are as comprehensive as your directions are, I shouldn't have too many issues.&nbsp;

<h3> stuartheaton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crashes when &#39;idle&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS8700 intel i7-4790 (incl. 256GB mSATA solid state drive plus hard drive) bought just a few months ago with 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>That worked fine.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I upgraded to 10 and have found that if I leave my PC alone for half an hour or so I come back to find the blue screen with "Recovery - It looks like Windows didn't load correctly" etc.</p>
<p>It doesn't do it all the time, just most of the time.</p>
<p>I have tried setting 'never' to the sleep options but to no avail (based on my guess the problem might have been linked to this).</p>
<p>Otherwise the system works very well.</p>
<p>Obviously I have never seen what actually happens when it decides to reboot (if that is what it does).</p>
<p>The system is fully up to date (set automatically).</p>
<p>I only have Defender on (no other anti virus software).</p>

<p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Your link tells me to restore to an earlier version.&nbsp; The only version I can restore to is from yesterday.&nbsp; I duly restored to it but I still have the same problem - the computer works perfectly until you leave it alone for half an hour and when you return
 it has the&nbsp;blue screen I mentioned above.</p>
<p>This problem has been going on for some weeks now, I just assumed a fix would be along shortly (searching around I see many, many people are having 'system at idle' problems).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never had this problem with 8.1, only since installing 10....</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

            <p>I too have that computer and also since I upgraded to windows 10,&nbsp; I get the same message as you. It's so frustrating. It happens when my computer goes to sleep but nothing helps as of yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a real pain reloading 20 or more tabs, and other documents and trying to continue where you left off. I'll keep searching on this site but no luck with anything I tried so far.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted or due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Check <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">if the issue occurs in
<strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>Refer below link to Enable<strong> Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10
</span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<span><strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></strong></a></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps in the above link are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same
</p>
<p>for windows 10 as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Four days ago I disabled some apps that were slowing my computer down on startup. Since then there have been no issues with "it looks like windows didn't load correctly"&nbsp; blue screen when my computer goes to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it comes back I will follow your suggestions above and report back. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I never really found out what caused my problem. &nbsp;I ran all the Dell hardware check programs and ensured I had all the latest drivers etc. but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rang Dell who couldn't immediately help - until we decided to reinstall W10 on a blank C drive and, hey-presto, the problem has gone away.
</p>
<p>Something went wrong with the upgrade procedure it seems (although it appeared to go well to me).</p>

            <p>That's good for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too made sure all my drivers were up to date, followed other advice on these forums, updated bios, adjusted sleep times etc. but nothing worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I found a thread online that said to disable some programs that were running on start-up and that seems to have worked so far. It goes to sleep and wakes up properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a clean install W10 media file on a flash drive that I downloaded from another W8.1 machine ready to go if the blue screen comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the blue recovery screen comes back I'll post back here and go ahead with the clean install as per instructions above.</p>

<br />
<br />I'm sorry but you'll need to explain a bit more.  I  cannot make out what you're trying to ask.  Are you stuck on the BIOS splash screen?  Are you asking if you can customize the Windows 10 startup animation (No)?  
<br />
<br />Please clarify so we can help you better.
