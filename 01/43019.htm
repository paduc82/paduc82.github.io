<p>Original Title: Technical problems with Windows Movie Maker</p>
<p>I was trying to make a video using Windows Movie Maker, but the program keeps making it to where I can't use it.&nbsp; I was editing the sound and video clips and all of a sudden, the preview screen turned black and when I press the play button, nothing happens.&nbsp;
 I have no idea how to fix it, but if I restart the program or even my computer, the situation does not change.&nbsp; Basically, the play button doesn't work.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to fix it? My project is due for school tomorrow...<br />

            I tried fixing the video filters using the link you provided, but that didn't help. &nbsp;I finally figured out the problem, though. &nbsp;I was using a MOV file, which apparently tends to have issues when you put it into Movie Maker, so I converted the files to
 a different type and they worked just fine. &nbsp;Thanks for your help!

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Can&#39;t install English &#40;US&#41; Language Pack after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>After the Anniversary Update, the interface language of my PC defaulted to Dutch&nbsp;(probably because the Netherlands is set as my region), although I set it to English before. I tried installing the English language pack several times in different ways; it
 downloads, it installs until 100% and then it tells me it was not installed for some reason. I have tried doing this via Settings, Control Panel and by manually downloading language packs (none of those were compatible). Is there any way to get my PC to install
 the pack or to download a compatible pack manually?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><em><strong>Translation:</strong> Some updates haven't been installed; the following updates haven't been installed</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The pack I tried to install:&nbsp;<strong>English LanguagePack - Windows 10 Version 1607 for AMD64-based Systems - (KB3180030) [en-US_LP]</strong>. One thing I noticed is that I don't have an AMD processor but an Intel, but this is the one it starts downloading
 when I press&nbsp;<em>Download and install language pack</em>.</p>

    <title>how do I know which apps to uninstall and which ones to keep after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monsterwizard  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I know which apps to uninstall and which ones to keep after downloading apps from a bad website&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I went to download.com and downloaded a few games and installed them. Then when I went to find the games, most couldn't be found. That was suspicious so I restarted the computer to have only windows programs installed and keep my personal files.
</p>
<p>When I explored the computer, I found that many things had changed (new apps I didn't have previously) and decided to do some research on the unfamiliar apps. It turned out that all of the unfamiliar apps were apps I didn't want, apps that were either malware,
 or apps that let pop ups to pop up while browsing, an app that jacked my homepage to go to a particular search engine and mess with my search results, an app that claimed to optimize my computer but was actually enabling various other apps to do other mischief.
</p>
<p>So I uninstalled all of those, but I'm still not sure if I got them all. </p>
<p>My question is, how can I tell what apps are good or bad? there are so many apps to search and research, and that would just be extremely time consuming. Is there a program or trick I can do to speed up the process?</p>
<p>I have windows 8 on an ASUS laptop, I just bought it recently so I'm not to familiar with the OS.

<p>
</p><p>WildTangent Inc. - Unless you play these WildTangent games, remove all WildTangent applications as they take up a lot of hard drive storage and is bloatware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dragon Assistant - Unless you have paid for this Dragon Speech software, I see no reason to have it installed.</p>

    <title>Problems with touch on the desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cadaei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with touch on the desktop</h2>
                    Ok, so I recently got the <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/twist/s230u/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lenovo Thinkpad Twist S230u laptop</a>, and it's been great so far. The touch screen itself is perfectly fine, and mostly works as it should in both the Desktop and Modern UI.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But sometimes, out of the blue, touch becomes unusable on the desktop. Obviously, this is more of a software problem (as opposed to hardware). What I mean by this is, I cannot interact with any element on the desktop and its applications. I cannot select
 or open files, open or close applications, open menus etc... The only things that I can really do (as far as I know) are open the calender in the system tray; and scroll and select links in the browser (Chrome, IE etc.)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To add to this problem, I also cannot swipe from the right nor left to access the Charms Bar or the App Switch Bar respectively. The Charms Bar is, however, still accessible through the mouse (but not the app switch bar). All this is happening, despite
 the fact that I am still able to use touch in the modern UI.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem mostly occurs after I wake the computer from sleep mode, although this can still occur while I use the computer. The problem can persist, even when I reboot the computer or wake the computer from sleep mode again. And then miraculously, as
 fast as it appears, the problem would be gone. Usually, the problem occurs for only a few hours (on a daily basis as well), and it can get really annoying especially when I take notes in OneNote during class.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated, thanks :)</div>

forum</a>.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Here's the solution:</div>
<div><a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-Knowledge-Base/Lenovo-Twist-Touch-Screen-is-unresponsive-after-suspend-sleep/ta-p/1168341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-Knowledge-Base/Lenovo-Twist-Touch-Screen-is-unresponsive-after-suspend-sleep/ta-p/1168341</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>As it turns out, this problem extends throughout nearly all users of the S230u. I downloaded the fix, and it seems to work so far. You would think, however, that Lenovo would make this fix an official update throughout all their S230u computers. Instead,
 you have to go to this forum yourself and download it from there.</div>

            <p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to incompatibility/corruption in Java files. I would suggest you to completely uninstall older version of Java and install new.
</p>

</p><p>Please refer to: <strong><a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Verify Java and Uninstall Out-of-Date Versions</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still remains, you may place the computer in clean boot state to check any third party software conflict.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup

<li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh winsock reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh int ip reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /release</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /renew</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /flushdns</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li></ul>
<p>In the third step, ipconfig/ rease no operations can be performed as media is disconnected. This error comes for Bluetooth, wlan and wifi all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried troubleshooting network adapter also but in vain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know the next steps.</p>

<h2>            Skype will not work at my Mexico vacation home &#40;for me at least&#41;</h2>
                    I have loaded the newest versions of Skype and updated Skype &amp; Microsoft account information. They both recognize me. Skype seems to work. But when I try to call out for a test call (or any call) I get 3 or 4 tones and then it stops....After about 30 seconds
 Skype stops trying. I have not received any help from Skype via email, or chat or via phone. Does anyone know a customer service number or email which works? Skype supposedly works in Mexico??? Thanks Paul

<p>Try connecting wired to see if anything changes.&nbsp; A low download and upload speed is not ideal for Skype.&nbsp; If your latency is too high Skype calls will cut out or not work properly.&nbsp; Run a
<a href="http://www.dslreports.com/pingtest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DSL reports Line quality - Ping Test [dslreports.com]
</a>and provide the Loss and latency and whether it passes or fails according to their measurements.&nbsp; Below displays a successful pass that should have no issue with Skype.&nbsp; Failing may point to ISP/connection/modem/router stability issues that would probably
 affect Skype call quality and stability. </p>

<h2>            Problem ze skradzionym kontem. &#91;Translate&#93; The Problem with the stolen account.</h2>
                    <p>Moje konto Microsoft/Xbox zostało skradzione. Ostatnio dostałem sms'a, że ktoś właśnie usunął mój telefon z konta. Kiedy próbowałem zalogować się na swoje konto wyskakuje błąd, że nie ma konta na tym mailu. Ktoś zmienił sobie maila, hasło i usunął mój numer
 telefonu z konta. Próbowałem napisać formularz ale trzeba podać maila, na którym jest konto i które chce się odzyskać. Niestety nie mogę napisać formularza bo mojego konta na tym mailu nie ma. Mam na tym koncie wykupioną subskrypcję Xbox Game Pass na 3 miesiące
 oraz zakupioną grę Forza Horizon 4 w wersji Ultimate (najdroższej). Wszystkie potwierdzenia wpłat za subskrypcję bądź też za samą grę mam na mailu. Próbowałem się skontaktować telefonicznie lecz na dzień dzisiejszy pomoc techniczna w języku polskim skończyła
 pracę. Proszę o szybką i sprawną pomoc, gdyż muszę przyznać, że cała ta sytuacja zaczyna mnie denerwować. Konto skradziono mi najprawdopodobniej w dniu 11.07.2019, gdyż wtedy dostałem sms'a, z usunięciem mojego telefonu z konta. Mam nadzieję, że ktoś z obsługi
 mi odpiszę i wtedy mogę podać na jakim mailu miałem skradzione konto. Mogę powiedzieć, że przed kradzieżą miałem nazwę użytkownika: TeKaoooo</p>

</p><p>My Microsoft/Xbox account has been stolen. Recently I got a sms'a that someone has just removed my phone from the account. When I tried to login to your account An error pops up that there is no account on this email. Someone has changed my email, password
 and deleted my phone number from my account. I tried to write the form but you have to enter the email where the account is and which you want to recover. Sorry I can not write a form because my account on this email is not. I have an Xbox Game Pass for 3
 months and an Ultimate (most expensive) Forza Horizon 4 game purchased on this account. All receipts for the subscription or the same game I have in the mail. I tried to contact the phone but for the present day technical support in the Polish language ended
 the work. I ask for quick and efficient help, because I must admit that this whole situation begins to annoe me. The account was stolen to me most likely on 11.07.2019, because then I got sms'a, with the removal of my phone from the account. I hope that someone
 from the service I write off and then I can give the Mail on which I had stolen the account. I can say that before theft I had a username: TeKaoooo</p>

 jeżeli chcę wejść w mój profil poprzez Microsoft Store otwiera się przeglądarka z profilem, z którego piszę właśnie tą wiadomość, a żeby jeszcze było lepiej z tamtego jeżeli wchodzę w Forze Horizon 4 bądź też w Forze Horizon 3 (którą też posiadałem na tym
 koncie w wersji standardowej) wyskakuje mi wiadomość, że mogę takie zakupić. Proszę o szybką pomoc i bardzo sprawną, gdyż te dwa tytuły do najtańszych nie należą oraz zależy mi żeby nikt nie miał dostępu do moich danych. Mam maila z potwierdzeniem kupna Forza
 Horizon 4 oraz pełno maili związanych ze zmianą hasła. Jeżeli chcę zmienić hasło na moim utraconym koncie, aplikacja prosi mnie o nazwę użytkownika.

<h2>            Lose Mouse Cursor after switching to tablet mode surface pro 4</h2>
                    <p>I love being able to flip the touch cover and use the Surface as a tablet, then flip the cover back and use the keyboard and mouse as a laptop.&nbsp; But over the last few weeks, I notice that when I return to laptop from tablet, I lose my mouse cursor.&nbsp; I keep
 running my finger on mousepad but no mouse cursor appears.&nbsp; It will only reappear with a force restart.&nbsp; This is frustrating because it really handcuffs me from being able to use surface as a tablet.&nbsp; I have already uninstalled/reinstalled keyboard drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this problem and have a solution?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            64-bit RAM upgrade from 2GB installed &#40;1.74GB usable&#41; to 4GB installed &#40;still 1.74GB usable&#41;</h2>
                    I recently replaced two 1GB RAM sticks in the two slots of my HP G56-127NR Notebook PC with two new 2GB RAM sticks in a Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit system that was originally sold as expandable to 16GB of RAM.&nbsp; Every diagnostic test I could find and
 run indicated that all 4GB are good.&nbsp; All of the System info on the computer indicates 4GB has been installed but on the System properties it displays "4.00 GB installed (1.74GB usable)".&nbsp; I've checked BIOs and am confident the latest version available is
 installed.&nbsp; Everything seems to be running fine except that it hasn't picked up any speed and when you monitor memory usage with Task Manager or Resource Monitor it pretty clearly shows that the new memory is not being used even though it is seen.&nbsp; The Resource
 Monitor seems to indicate that it has been grabbed for hardware.&nbsp; I have not changed any hardware (other than the memory sticks) associated with this computer.&nbsp; HP dodges the entire issue because

            <p>LemP...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let me thank you for your response to my problem.&nbsp; It (your response)&nbsp;is very thorough and indicates you gave in-depth thought to my issue and did considerable work on my behalf.&nbsp; I am deeply appreciative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I am pleased to report that I have stumbled across a solution and my issue is now resolved.&nbsp; Here is what I did for the actual "fix". (I tried and did many other things too numerous to mention here and actually of no value since they didn't work) -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I removed one stick of the two 2GB sticks I had purchased to replace the two 1GB sticks that came with the machine.&nbsp; I was curious as to whether it would boot up and it did without any problem.&nbsp; Once it booted, I checked the System Properties page from
 the Computer icon on the desktop.&nbsp; It then read 2.00GB (1.74GB usable), the exact same reading I had received on the two 1GB sticks before I replaced them and the same reading, as far as usable,&nbsp;I received when I installed the two 2GB sticks (which prompted
 the question initially posed here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Next, I inserted one of the 1GB old sticks in the empty slot next to the slot now holding one of the two new 2GB sticks. After I booted, the System Properties page read 3.00GB (2,74GB usable).&nbsp; Aha, the installed was now correct and the usable increased
 accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Lastly, I pulled the one 1GB stick out and replaced it with the second new 2GB stick.&nbsp; When I booted up SHAZZAM, the System Properties page read 4.00GB (3.74GB usable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Resource Monitor shows memory now reserved for hardware has now dropped 2.00GB (or whatever, it is much, much lower than it was while the problem existed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost as if I kicked or jarred something and got it to work.&nbsp; Go figure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to some of your specific points -</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I've had previous satisfactory experience with Crucial memory so that's where I went in the beginning and I found their scanning tool to be excellent and they pretty much guaranteed that what they were sending me would/should be correct (they are DDR3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I ran every diagnostic test I could find on my machine starting with the diagnostic tools in BIOS.&nbsp; Everything always showed the entire 4GBs as good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, it is really cool to have experts like yourself LemP, to monitor forums/boards/communities/whatever, to come to the rescue of those of us that don't have the necessary expertise.&nbsp; In the course of my little bit of research on this problem, I
 came across a ton of entries over several years and at numerous tech locations&nbsp;under headings about usable RAM being substantially lower than installed RAM.&nbsp; People came up with all kinds of things to consider and try but I don't ever remember seeing a suggestion
 to try something like what I did to successfully fix what I was able to fix.&nbsp; I hope it might work for someone else too.</p>

            I think there is nothing to do with the type of the cable. The problem is probably caused by unstable connection of socket, please try to tighten the screw on each side of the cable with graphic card and monitor.

    <title>Windows 10 Family Safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bscorpio73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety</h2>
                    I would like to see Family Safety return to the Local User Accounts in Windows 10. &nbsp;My kids do not and will not have a login with a Microsoft account, so I do not want to use a web based account to manage the User Accounts. &nbsp;Also, with the Family Safety
 option with Windows 8, I was able to allow my kids to sign onto to their computers for an hour, take a break for an hour, then log back in. &nbsp;I could not determine how to do that with the Family Safety web based feature. &nbsp;All I could do was limit their time
 to 30 minutes, No Access, or Unlimited Access. &nbsp;This will not do. &nbsp;I would really like to see the Family Safety feature revert back to the Windows 8 structure, within a Windows 10 update. &nbsp;You really have taken away the freedom of the parents to control how
 and when their kids use the computer. &nbsp;I do not like it at all, and am thinking of downgrading. &nbsp;Bad decision.....

            <p>I'm running into an issue where my son's computer shows twice, I have UNLIMITED time set for him, but when he logs in it says he's used all his time for the DAY??? And when I set it to NOT have time settings, it says he'll be logged out at midnight? It's
 all KINDS of messed up. I really liked with 7 and 8 that if I need to added 30-60 minutes to allow them to finish a project, I could do it without having to log into the website. Which seems to be unresponsive sometimes. I had a laptop I just upgraded to 10,
 but when I go to add my children's accounts, it says it can't communicate with the Windows Family site. But if I go to add the accounts to my family, it says they are already members - WHICH MEANS IT CAN CONTACT THE WINDOWS FAMILY SITE!!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it's the same thing that happened on July 29. Everyone is hitting the Family site hard, and then it can't respond, thus causing kinds of headaches.</p>

<p>I completely understand the desire not to have&nbsp;a MS acct/email requirement for kids but there is a definite upside for me.&nbsp; With 4 kids and 7 computers in the house, that was 28 accounts to maintain in Win8 style/local accts!&nbsp; We didn't actually have all
 of them but if I wanted to change any setting for one child, it was a minimum of four acct to work through...&lt;Removed&gt;!&nbsp; One setting change for all 4 kids was a minimum of 16 accts...t&lt;Removed&gt; So I do enjoy a single control point, set once and effective across
 all devices!!!</p>
<p>That said, I completely agree that particularly the screen time controls with the 30min blocks of time for the entire week, gave such fabulous granular control.&nbsp; A mighty downgrade we are living with now.</p>

            Does that mean if I had a clean install, the settings would work as they do in Windows 8? &nbsp;If so, is there a way to fix this without doing a clean install and recreating accounts. &nbsp;I have three laptops for &nbsp;each of my three kids. &nbsp;That would be an &nbsp;all

            Yep Family Safety is in deed broken under Windows 10.&nbsp; However it is completely fixable if MS want to do it.&nbsp; Considering how important limiting computer usage and monitoring what children are looking at on the internet is&nbsp;I am surprised that this was
 allowed to happen.

            The familysafety site won't come up on my Windows 7 machine; I have to do it on a Windows 10 computer. It's always "Loading..." And I've managed to lock my other son out of his computer unless I disable time management. If you block a day, it seems to
 be a block FOREVER for that computer. I'm going to try to do a complete user wipe on one computer to see if that fixes it, but that also means I can't ever use the Block all day option again.<br />

            <p>I ended up removing my daughters PC from the family safety website as it was not refreshing with the family safety website and had a mind of it's own similar to what you describe.&nbsp; I then had to log in to my daughters PC using her login and run the Task
 Scheduler as 'an Administrator".&nbsp; I then disabled the Family Safety Tasks under Microsoft/Windows/Shell.&nbsp; That returned her PC to normal.&nbsp; I then sent another invitation from Family Safety website and then manually enabled the Family Safety tasks on her PC.&nbsp;
 Now seems to be working.......... until the next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is that we shouldn't be having these problems.</p>

            <p>I agree 100%, and don't know what Microsoft was thinking.&nbsp; Perhaps the company is run by children who don't want to be limited on the internet???&nbsp; In order to put safety controls on a child's computer use, I have to give him an email account that will soon
 be receiving who-knows-what sort of spam, and probably allowing even more downloads of junk to corrupt the PC in general without my knowledge.&nbsp; Very Bad Idea.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello LarryClinton1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try resetting your router by unplugging it and then plugging it back in to its power source after 45 seconds. Restarting your Xbox after you’ve done that wouldn’t hurt, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though other people are having this problem and Xbox Support is aware of issues with the Microsoft Store as recently as today. Maybe they are somehow connected. Hopefully your issue will resolve soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for using the forums!<br />

            The users of xbox 360 are experiencing the same problem with the application of netflix, for the moment still no solution for the problem is found, if you want the return of your money I recommend that you contact directly with netflix to request the cancellation
 of your membership

    <title>Breaking Into A Surface Without The Password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Breaking Into A Surface Without The Password</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife was in a head on collision with a semi-truck about a month ago and everything surrounding her death is a mystery, as she was 150 miles from home with my daughter and there was no reason for her to be driving in that area.&nbsp; She had been pulled over
 because a driver called highway patrol claiming she was driving erratically.&nbsp; A sobriety test was given and she was let go, only to have the highway patrol being called again by another motorist less than 30 miles later.&nbsp; The police tailed her and didn't see
 anything warranting her being pulled over again so they stopped their observation of her.&nbsp; Within the hour she was dead and my 4 year old suffered a broken femur, clavicle, and had eye damage, luckily she survived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife did some weird things over a five day period and through my detective work I am certain her computer, Surface, and Gmail hold some answers.&nbsp; I just received the surface, but she changed the password on it and I am unable to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a way to access her Surface without losing any data or settings.&nbsp; I do not care what I have to do, as she was on her Surface minutes before she decided to go on that fateful drive and the history, along with a possible open Gmail account may help
 me to make heads or tails of the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a little girl who will one day want answers, just as I do now.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; If you do have a way please explain it to me as if I no understanding of computers through a list I can easily follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you.&nbsp; I am hopeful someone on here will see that this is a genuine good thing to do&nbsp; for a family who has only questions and very little answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care.</p>

            You may need to take it back to the police and see if they can get a technology forensic kit and extract the data off of the Surface.&nbsp; You can call and ask them about it since they would still have an investigation going on, on that incident.&nbsp; They would
 be interested in that information as well.<br />

<h2>            Programs On Computer Won&#39;t Run</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So none of the programs on my computer will run normally unless I right click on them and run them as administrator. I click on a program to open it and nothing happens. This started happening after I was restarting my computer for an update for iTunes.
 The restart was interrupted so maybe that has something to do with this. I've tried running my antivirus program (AVG) but it did not detect any viruses. I downloaded the microsoft safety scanner also to check for problems and it didn't find anything. Also
 I cannot restart my computer the proper way, I have to use the power button. So if someone could help me out or point me in the right direction, it would really be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t seem to download an update</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to reset my Windows update but when I try to update (KB3081452) it still won't update. This is very frustrating! I get the error 0x8007000d. No matter what I try to download this update it won't take. Can anyone please help me with this? The only
 thing that I can see to do now is to revert back to factory specs and start over. I don't want to do that so I need help downloading this update. I switched from&nbsp; Windows 8.1 - 10. Since then this is the first problem I have had with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help I can get. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the methods mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components <br />
a) Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.<br />
b) Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;net stop bits<br />
&nbsp;net stop msiserver<br />
&nbsp;c) Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old<br />
d) Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
net start bits <br />
net start msiserver<br />
e) Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.<br />
Now you may try&nbsp; to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to first run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management command (DISM). It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps:<br />
1. Press Windows key + X.<br />
2. Click command prompt (Run as administrator).<br />
3. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press Enter key after each command:<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
4. To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p />

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to move the location of Windows 10 mail to a different drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found the location of the email (<strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data)&nbsp;</strong>in this thread&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-mail-and-people-apps-storage-locations/062818af-c1cb-46ff-8cbf-66f25b9a854d?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cant see anyway to move the files / point Mail at a different drive location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@ MS - If I cant move these files off my small boot SSD (before it fills) I am going to have to stop using mail, I cant be unique in this, would be great if it worked like Outlook with PST's</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was working fine on my computer when I tried to shut it down.&nbsp; I accidently selected hibernate and the system proceeded to start hibernating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I wanted a full shutdown, I did a hard shutdown, holding the power on button until it turned off.&nbsp; It did fine and I went to bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Upon trying it today, I have a computer with the fan whirling, but nothing going to my turned on monitor.&nbsp; My screen is black.&nbsp; I rebooted hard again and same thing.&nbsp; I put in my Windows 7 CD to see if it would boot from the CD but still nothing.&nbsp; Very
 frustrated as last month my hard drive became corrupted and I just replaced that.</p>
<p>Please let me know troubleshooting steps.</p>

            try resting the BIOS by taking out the lithium ion battery on the motherboard for about 20 seconds and put it back in, it is possible you might have to do that 2 or three times, then when the computer boots up and is in running the POST tap the F8 button
 untill you have the safe mode boot options and boot into safe mode.

<p>I missed the original question, so I don't know what the problem is<br />
here. But let me state the following:</p>
<p>How long you need to keep the battery out to reset the BIOS depends on<br />
the particular motherboard. Twenty seconds may be sufficient for some,<br />

<h2>            Combine XAC &#40;Xbox adaptive controller&#41; with the normal xbox one controller</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I only have movement in one hand, and I use to play with the normal xbox one controller. The problem is with the left and right trigger, that I cannot use correctly. When I see the XAC I though that it would be the ideal solution, but I cannot combine both
 controllers in order to use de XAC buttons as RT and LT.<br />
<br />
Anyone knows how to do it, or at least if is possible?

<p>Hello Alberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand the question correctly, it sounds like you would like to use the Xbox controller along with the Xbox adaptive controller to control the same profile. Co-Pilot would be the feature you are looking for! Check out this link for instructions
 on how to set up this feature: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/controllers/play-with-adaptive-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Play with the Xbox Adaptive Controller&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn on Copilot</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If customization is more in line with your question, please review our article&nbsp;on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/controllers/customize-adaptive-controller-in-xbox-accessories-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and let us know the results!</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Instant Money</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi, dears,<br />
Yesterday I found another way to make millions quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this tip works, you have to have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CR 150.000</span> and at least
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">15 skill points</span>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the Autoshow and then Look for a <em><strong>1982 Porsche 911 Turbo 3.3</strong></em>; this car will cost&nbsp;
<em><strong>CR 150.000</strong></em>, buy it.</li><li>After buying the car, go to the menu cars and then car mastery.</li><li>On the left column spend your skill points to open the whole left column.</li><li>This procedure will give to you wheel spin, and <strong>CR 300.000</strong>, that is, you will cover the money that you already spent to buy the car and get more CR 150.000 extra, after which you can sell the car and do the same thing.</li></ol>
<p>If you do this at least <strong><em>20 times</em></strong>, you will get easily
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>CR 3.000.000 </strong></span>million.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This tip works for all formula drift cars.<br />
I have a video showing this on my channel but I am not quite sure if can I share with you guys here.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I hope that this helps you out.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>More information about Forza Horizon 4, ask me, will be a pleasure help, you guys.</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi IRB,<br />
It is not a glitch. It is skill points distribution.<br />
For it, you have to play to make skill points and of course you need to have CR 150.000. So, I mean, this is an honest way to make money.</p>
<p><br />
For me, the worst scenario are some streamers on Mixer that do not play the game and live 24/7 streaming a static scene getting influence points and misleading the people to follow them in exchange to sparks and influence points.&nbsp;

<p>Indeed you are correct, it does require more effort that just buying and clicking a few options. you need to earn the skill points first to spend etc.</p>
