<h2>            Windows 8,   Audible download manager not working</h2>
                    <p>For some reason this program is no longer compatible on my laptop and I have no idea how to fix it.&nbsp; Apparently the program is up to date but it isn't working how it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I delete and start again?</p>
<p>Getting very frustrated as I need to listen to some books!!!</p>

<p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern with the Settings app in Windows 10 can be due to the changes in the configuration of your device and/or corrupted system files. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>If you've experienced the same issue when launching other Windows apps (e.g. Control Panel and Task Manager).
</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing the steps posted on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to troubleshoot problems with the Start menu. Performing this will isolate the possible connection of Start menu issues when sorting, searching, and launching apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Same thing here! Many, Many, people are encountering this error/bug! My computer was working fine then after this update its been 5 days of frustration and just hell where my computer is completely inoperable. First I could not click on the start menu to
 open the start menu and then I noticed Cortana and my taskbar were inoperable (where I couldn't click on or open anything in my taskbar) then I discovered I couldn't even use the Windows key on my keyboard to open the start menu. Finally I was able to find
 out I could not open ANY settings or even get to my Settings by using any method!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install, deleted Everything and formatted my Samsung 950 Pro NVMe</p>
<p>M.2 SSD over 4 times; and same issues! And the formatting and deleting has seriously decreased the lifespan of this very expensive hard drive... Yet Nothing has been fixed or repaired and the Fresh Start or "Repair" Install advice is utterly useless..! Now
 I just can't continue wasting any more time or mental health trying to get windows to work right. Microsoft OWES its customer a fix or an actual Patch or hotfix... not these useless DIY ne'er-do-wells posting "tips"or things to try when they can barely read
 English! In other threads Microsoft "representatives" are telling people with this same problem to open their settings using the Start Menu that people are complaining is broken and they can't get to, to
<p>
</p><p>I paid over a Hundred dollars for Microsoft Windows 10 Home Edition from Walmart when I built this computer last year. And the least I could expect was for it to work and to be able to use my computer! Some people are recommending Linux as a better OS and
 I can see why now! This Windows 10 OS is the worst ever and Microsoft doesn't give a dam% about their customers or actually fixing the problems and havoc THEIR updates have caused!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Luckily from my signature/info on a PC Builders forum I had listed my system information and was able to find my Windows Build information from January 1, 2017 right before the trouble started... (Windows 10 64-Bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Version 1709 OS Build 16299.1922</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody should open a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for all the problems they have created in peoples lives; with no concern whatsoever on how their "Automatic"/mandatory, forced, horrible/hurried/hair brained, rushed out, untested, updates have
 affected peoples lives and livelihoods. If Microsoft is going to force everyone to receive their "Automatic" updates they should at least TEST them THOROUGHLY and MAKE SURE they won't harm people's computers or hurt their businesses or interrupt our lives
 and livelihoods. Even Forbes business magazine is reporting this latest update as a Microsoft disaster!</p>

<p>Dear Microsoft -</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have outdone yourself!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only are settings STILL not working consistently, but now the task-changing Alt-Tab function no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter issue has only been present since the last update of Windows. I would share the build and update package reference number, but since I cannot get into my Settings to view anything, we are out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow... almost forgot the issue of nothing refreshing. For example, if I plug in a hard drive or other device, nothing shows up on my taskbar or 'This PC' view until I hit F5 to refresh it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I eject said drive, it THEN shows and will not go away until I again manually refresh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This too has only been affecting me since the last 'update'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this... thank you.</p>

<p><span>I’ve had my Surface pro for 5 weeks and after a ten day absence switched on yesterday morning. There was a very brief screen message saying something about “upgrades” after which the screen message “Your PIN is no longer available &nbsp;due to
 a change to the security settings on this device. You can set up your PIN again by going to Settings...etc” appeared.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>The trouble is that I have no way of getting into Settings. There is no Task bar, no icons/buttons. The only things that are visible on screen (see below edited screen) are the wifi icon and battery life indicator plus the on/off indicator on
 a wallpaper background of a football pitch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits__On a multicore cpu</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone explain to me,why does Windows 7 <strong>64 bit version,</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong>install, only 32 bit drivers, on all 4 cores of my 64 bit,4 core cpu??</p>
<p>That is an AMD phenom 4 core 9950 125 watt,that is both 32 and 64 bit rated.</p>
<p>Fitted on the recomended Asus M3A32-MVP Deluxe motherboard.</p>
<p>With 8,(yes eight) gigabyte of ram fitted.</p>
<p>Every thing runs ok, but it seems such a waste to only have the 32 bit option of driver available,Is this correct?</p>
<p>If it is correct,why is it correct?</p>

            What makes you think that there are 32-bit drivers installed on your Windows 7 64-bit machine?&nbsp; Some sort of error message?

<p>No, I simply listed the drivers and only 32 bit drivers are listed.</p>
<p>Mind you there is hardly a day goes by without a serious (need to push reset button)crash happening.</p>
<p>It used to run fine on the RC version of windows 7and it had 64 bit drivers installed,but as soon as I installed the retail version,no 64 bit drivers and daily crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if there is any connection between drivers and crashing but it happens, and it is running&nbsp; slower.</p>
<p>And yes it did pass the compatibility test.</p>
<p>And before you ask yes it was a clean install to blank disks.</p>

<p>I don't know what tool you're using to list the drivers, but if you have installed a 64-bit version of the OS, they are definitely 64-bit or your machine wouldn't even boot.<br />
<br />
As for the crashes, I'd suggest starting a new thread for those and posting more details on when they happen, if there's any sort of pattern visible.<br />
<br />
You might also want to put a few of the files from c:\windows\minidumps to your SkyDrive account -

<p>That would be,device manager,windows 7's own,and all cpu drivers are listed as 32 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why wouldn't a 64/32 bit cpu work with 32 bit drivers?</p>
<p>The crashes are caused by a bios that is so old that Noah used it,but this windows 7 'compatable' PC motherboard manufacturer (Asus) refuses to publish any windows 7 bios, they claim that 64 bit vista&nbsp;bios will work! But which one there are about 50 of them!</p>
<p>The whole thing packed up this week after it auto installed a 'windows 7 approved' video card driver update,(nvidia 9800 gx2) it asked for a restart and promptly died a rapid death,even a complete reinstall of windows 7 would not cure this.I had&nbsp;to&nbsp;delete
 the drives and start again,now it will only boot into safe mode,and in windows 7 in safe mode, nothing works,you cannot use repair there&nbsp;are no restore files because I had to wipe the disks&nbsp;and the windows image files that I so carefully recorded,will not
 cure the boot problem.Oh and also you cannot do an upgrade install in windows in safe mode,if the damned thing weren't so heavy I would have launched&nbsp;it all&nbsp;out of the window, windows 7 ultimate disk included.</p>

<p>ruffian - I've looked in device manager, and the only thing that I see that might suggest to you that the 32-bit drivers are loaded is the path to the drivers (c:\windows\system32\drivers).&nbsp; Is that why you think that there are 32-bit drivers loaded?&nbsp; If
 not, please explain how you're coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>If there are 50 BIOS updates available for your motherboard, you shouldn't try to choose...just go with the latest :)&nbsp; Do you know the exact model of your motherboard, so that you can select the correct BIOS?&nbsp; If not, go into the BIOS setup page and you
 can usually find the model number somewhere in there.</p>
<p>If things still aren't working after a complete re-install of the OS, then I think you may have bigger issues here (likely hardware problems).<br />
<br />
Edit:&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; After I finished my reply, I see that you named the motherboard in your first post.&nbsp; Looks like there are 2 versions of your board: M3A32-MVP DELUXE and M3A32-MVP DELUXE/WIFI AP</p>
<p>If you have the normal deluxe version, the latest BIOS update can be found here -
<a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?modelname=M3A32-MVP DELUXE&amp;SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?modelname=M3A32-MVP DELUXE&amp;SLanguage=en-us</a></p>
<p>If you have the wifi version, the latest BIOS update can be found here - <a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?modelname=M3A32-MVP DELUXE/WIFI-AP&amp;SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?modelname=M3A32-MVP DELUXE/WIFI-AP&amp;SLanguage=en-us</a></p>
<p>If you're upgrading, I'd suggest staying away from the beta BIOSes (beta indicates that they haven't completed testing yet).&nbsp; There are always risks associated with BIOS upgrades, so make sure you read the instructions before giving it a shot.</p>

            Windows Live Movie Maker does not support animated .gif files.<br />
<br />
The following article may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Windows Live Movie Maker - Animated GIFs

<br />
If you have an earlier version of Movie Maker you could import the <br />
.gif file and save it as a .wmv file. Then use the .wmv in WLMM.<br />
<br />
And the freeware IrfanView can extract the frames from an animated <br />
.gif file and you could import them into WLMM individually.<br />
<br />
Open an animated .gif in IrfanView and go to...Options / Extract All <br />
Frames...choose a destination directory, choose a format, left click <br />
the Start button.

Hi there,<br />
<br />
What is your Lync 2013 version?<br />
<br />
Check the Outlook deleted items if conversation history has accidently deleted.<br />
<br />
To track down a specific conversation type in a term that might have come up in the conversation in the search box at the top of the Outlook window.<br />
<br />
Look at your conversation history in Lync<br />
Check if your conversation history is available, in the Lync main window, click the Conversations tab<br />
<br />
Find a previous conversation - Lync&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-a-previous-conversation-lync-d1d54123-0301-482e-b047-c82e9e2724a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-a-previous-conversation-lync-d1d54123-0301-482e-b047-c82e9e2724a3</a>&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi, I am having a similar issue with my Lenovo T430. I can not enable wifi. I can not disable airplane mode. Airplane mode switch is grayed out, wifi is not grayed out, but nothing happens when you switch&nbsp; it on (can't disable airplane). I have tried every
 possible online solution I could find with no avail. I have resorted to a clean install of Win 10 pro (my activated edition), clean install of Win 10 home, used a different MTC install for both (I have 2 different USB flash devices with MTC), changed bios
 settings, loaded default bios settings, and I still can not disable airplane mode. My Lenovo has a lighted wireless icon that stays lit throughout bios, but as soon as Windows begins to load it goes out and stays out.&nbsp; There is no wifi icon in my system tray.
 Please help before I slash my wrists...………...</p>

    <title>How to report an error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minosante  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to report an error&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to report a buggy behavior in Windows 7 Pro (64 and 32b versions) and would like to know which is the appropriate way to do so.<br />
<br />
It's about a minor error, but it's kind of annoying:<br />
If you personalize your desktop view and change the desktop icons using the Control Panel<br />
See: Appearance and Personalization =&gt; Personalization =&gt; Change desktop icons.<br />
<br />
The Recycle Bin icon will not automatically change anymore between full and empty when it should do.<br />
This is because the windows routine that changes the name of the icons in the Registry forgets to put a ",0" at the end of the Value.<br />
The right keys should look like this:<br />
<br />
Key:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\DefaultIcon<br />
<br />
Values (example):<br />
@ (default) &nbsp; REG_EXPAND_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Folder Icons\Recycle-Full.ico<span style="font-weight: bold">,0</span><br />
empty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_EXPAND_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Folder Icons\Recycle-Empty.ico<span style="font-weight: bold">,0</span><br />
full &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; REG_EXPAND_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Folder Icons\Recycle-Full.ico<span style="font-weight: bold">,0</span><br />
<br />
The ",0" at the end of the lines must currently be changed manually by the user after doing their personalization.<br />
It's not a big issue, but Microsoft cannot expect the users to to this.<br />

<h3> eric_&#40;edu&#41; m. chen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 boot with Windows logo instead of HP</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this time I have a question with my other computer, which is a HP Elite Slice running the newest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nowadays I've seen that the boot screen with the <strong>Windows logo </strong>
looks better than the one that I got, the modified HP logo. Do I have a way for the boot screen to have the
<strong>Windows logo</strong>&nbsp;to show up at boot instead of the HP logo? If there isn't a way to do that then I'm fine with the original HP logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>

            Hi Eric
<br />
<br />The setting for that is built into a chip on the motherboard on your PC and is not user configurable
<br />
<br />If you have UEFI BIOS, then more than likely the manufacturer (HP) have overridden the Windows Logo on boot
<br />
<br />Sometimes, though very rarely if you Boot into BIOS, you can turn off the manufacturers logo on boot - on a HP repeatedly press F10 on the HP logo to boot your system into BIOS
<br />
<br />Please note, do not make any other changes in BIOS settings . ..

<h2>            Sign-in options for PIN</h2>
                    <p>I've just updated my computer and noticed that I have to log into my computer using my Microsoft&nbsp;account password. I log in and go to my settings to see what is up. I noticed that it says to "ADD" a new PIN number. I follow all the directions and it says
 "<strong>We need to verify your identity&nbsp;for <em>**insert email address</em></strong>". I add in my old PIN number that I had before.......Kinda weird I have to do this.&nbsp; I add my old PIN number and nothing happens. It stills says I need to add a new PIN number
 when I already have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even clicked on <strong>I forgot my PIN,&nbsp;</strong>but it says <strong>You can reset your PIN by going to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options.</strong>&nbsp;But the problem is that I CANNOT reset my PIN because it says that I haven't made one before. (which
 I had before my computer updated)</p>

<p>Hi Jihye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge you're experiencing with updating your PIN might be due to a corrupted system file. That being said, we'll need more information to isolate the possible causes of your concern. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue affecting all the user profiles on Windows 10 device?<br />
</li><li>What is the current Version and OS Build of your Windows 10 device?</li></ul>
<p><span>To verify the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Version</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">OS
 Build</span><span>&nbsp;of your Windows 10 PC, click the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>&nbsp;button,
 type&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">About your PC</span><span>, and then press&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we advise running the troubleshooter for Microsoft account. This will automatically scan and fix any issues detected with your Microsoft account signed into your Windows 10 PC. You can access the troubleshooter from this
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/microsoftaccounts.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues even after running the troubleshooter, we recommend running the
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and the <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool. These tools will scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Follow the steps outlined in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026529/windows-10-using-system-file-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Using System File Checker in Windows 10">
<strong>article</strong></a> on how to run the <strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and
<strong>SFC</strong> tool. Please make sure that you're signed in as the administrator before running the tools.</p>

</p><p>

<h2>            program is incompatible with Logitech extreme 3d pro</h2>
                    Running a H.P. windows 7 . the Logitech extreme 3d program was downloaded from the Logitech site, 6 months ago, worked fine up to a week ago &nbsp;(when new, did not come with c.d.) this is a gaming joy stick. The program would not start, if I clicked on the
 icon nothing at all would happen !, so I went to control panel and deleted the program, then re installed a new one, from the Logitech website, and lo and behold the same problem !, so I thought it might be a problem with the connector or circuit board in
 the Logitech unit &nbsp;so I had a old unit ( exactly the same model) and tried that one (which is a known good unit) and the same thing!. when i run the windows program compatibility program it would always come back as "incompatible program" .I tried everything
 imaginable to make it work, I'm out of options.&nbsp;

<p><span><span><font>1.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font>Do you receive any error message when launch the Extreme 3D Pro Joystick program or when you connect the joystick to the computer?</font></p>

 crazy thing is when I click on the icon (with or without the unit plugged in) the icon only fades a bit ( like it acknowledges the mouse pointer ) then nothing at all happens no error message nothing trying to start, can't hear the hard drive spinning to higher
 r.p.m.s or absolutely nothing. went to the Logitech site and did all the updates and trouble shooting etc, tried changing a few things in properties, deleted and reloaded the program about 10 times even did a system restore to a earlier version that was known
 to work, I do have Norton anti virus but that would usually give a error on program problems, I'm stuck can't figure this one out.</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps:</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Method 1:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Run the hardware troubleshooter and check what happens.</font></font></font></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0563c1"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</strong></font></a></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><b>Method 2:</b> As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps
 resolve the issues.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</b></font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><b>Note:</b> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>3. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>4. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link for assistance:</font></font></font></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0563c1"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></font></a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the issue still persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hope this helps, if you need further assistance on Windows let us know we will be glad to help.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Can I use my ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 256 MB that came with my laptop &#40;HP Compaq nx9420&#41; to run Windows 7 in Aero mode&#63;</h2>
                    I already asked ATI(AMD), they sent me to ask HP, and HP told me to run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor. The advisor told me it was not compatible with Aero, but it didn't say why. I check the specs, and it should support Aero.

            I've run the upgrade advisor on two desktops, both with an ATI Radeon X1300 PCI Xpress card&nbsp;(one with 512mb, other with 256mb) in them. On&nbsp;my Dell it says Aero will be fine, but on the HP it say the same card isn't compatible with W7 Aero.<br />
<br />
I've been running the W7rc for months with Aero switched on with the&nbsp;Dell, so how accurate is the upgrade advisor ?<br />

<blockquote>The advisor told me it was not compatible with Aero, but it didn't say why. I check the specs, and it should support Aero.</blockquote>
It will support Aero, however your card is part of a series of cards where drivers have been discontinued and only Vista drivers are available, that is probably why Upgrade Advisor is saying it doesn't support it.<br />

            Windows update has a generic driver that works pretty well with the x1600 in windows 7, but there are some major downfalls. &nbsp;Aero will run fine, but you will have major issues trying to play 3D games, or watching videos from youtube, hulu, etc. in full
 screen (it will be laggy). &nbsp;Also there are issues when connecting to a 1080p external display (I did not have the same issues running running XP).
<div><br />
<div>Windows 7 is an excellent OS, but the lack of mobility x1600 support is a shame. &nbsp;I had to drop it and go back to XP because the lack of driver support was very frustrating. &nbsp;Ati/Microsoft should really get on their game and add full support for W7, the
 x1600 is not that old of a card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, don't bother trying to use the modded drivers for the x1600, I have tried many times and have had no success (if some has had success with the modded drivers with a mobility x1600 please let me know!)</div>

<h2>            Windows Vista -This copy of windows is not genuine</h2>
                    This is driving me mad. I have had my HP Pavilion for just under 3 years. It came with Windows Vista Home Premium pre installed. A few days ago following some updates it suddenly decided it was not valid. Have checked on the forum and this appears to be
 a recurring problem. I've already run CHKDSK C:&nbsp; and sfc /scannow. There were problems the first time but they were fixed. The COA sticker is on the bottom of my laptop but you can barely read it. The only product key I have is the manufacturers.&nbsp; It has been
 checked and checked again and rebooted but it will not take the product key.&nbsp; The error message I get on entering the Product Key is 0xC004F063 - The Software Licensing Service reported that the computer BIOS is missing a required license.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
I did have a different error previously so something changed during the various checks.<br />
<br />
Here's the current diagnostic<br />

I've also tried a Restore to prior to the updates and it completed but as soon as you boot up you get the message that it has failed and the system has not been restored.
<br />
<br />
Only thing I have left to try is a phone activation but this is driving me nuts! It seems to be a common problem with HP Laptops that are 3 years old judging from the number of threads. Are HP including a time sensitive bug to get the laptops to commit suicide???
 (sorry feeling very fed up today). Does anyone have any bright ideas or should I just go for phone activation?<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>You need to change the Product Key to the one on the COA sticker on the machine's case (or inside the battery compartment),<span>&nbsp;

            I am afraid it would take a miracle to be able to read the COA sticker. There really is no chance. Seems my only option is to try phone activation.
<br />
<br />
There certainly seems to be a time sensitive problem with pre loaded software judging from the high incidence of this error over a period of years. Call me cynical but I can't help thinking it is designed to get us to purchase new hardware/software on a regular
 basis.<br />

            <p>Your problem is that for some reason, the system is unable to properly read the SLIC table in the BIOS, which is required to be able to self-activate the OEM_SLP Key with which the computer came
 installed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The normal solution is to change the Key to the one on your COA sticker - but you say that you are unable to read the Key there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the only things you can do are
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) recreate the Licensing Store - in case it's a minor software problem causing the misread
</p>
<p>2) try updating the BIOS to the latest available Vista-compliant one, from the manufacturer's website
</p>
<p>3) Contact the manufacturer direct, and see if they can provide assistance to correct the SLIC table
</p>
<p>4) a reformat and reinstall using the manufacturer's recovery media
</p>
<p>5) purchase a new license for Windows (or a new computer)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You've already tried #1</span></p>
<p><span>#2 and #3 don't apply</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;- which leaves #4 and #5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There *may* be an alternative solution though, if you are patient and persistent.</p>
<p>Attempt Telephone Activation, and speak to an operator - they will tell you that your current Key is blocked (they should then ask for confirmation of your Product Key). Explain to them your problem,
 that you need to change the Key to the one on your sticker, but that the sticker is unreadable (could they please supply a replacement Key?). Hopefully they will ask for documentary proof of the sticker, in the form of an email with a picture of the affected
 sticker - and you can proceed from there.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes two or three calls before you get an operator who actually knows and uses this procedure - but I know that it can and does happen.</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Does
 this happen with all the commercial DVDs that you are trying to play or any particular DVD?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if this happens with other DVDs like non commercial DVDs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First ensure that you have the right settings to play the DVDs on the Media Player, run the Media Player troubleshooter on your computer that will
 reset the media player settings: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 View all, and then click Windows Media Player Settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check out this article for more information on this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>DVD's come with soundtracks that allow a user a certain amount of configuration depending on the hardware/speaker configuration.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It could be possible that the problem is caused by your decoder or sound card. It could also be possible that the speakers are connected to an incorrect
 output on the sound card. Check if the connections are right.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can check if the sound devices are configured correctly for your Media Player:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Windows Media Player, Click on Tools, Options.<br />
2. On the Device Tab, select "Speakers in the Devices list and click on 'Properties'.<br />
3. In the properties dialog, check if the device is set to use or the default device or a separate device.<br />
4. Also try setting a different sound device.<br />
5. Apply the settings and close Media player.</span></span></p>

                    After updating my Hp laptop to Windows 10 Version 1803, thumbnails of .mkv files are not loading but for other video file types such as .mp4 load and display correctly. All thumbnails were showing correctly before upgrading to version 1803.&nbsp; The current
 build I am using is Build 17134.112. I hope Microsoft fixes this issue in the next cumulative update.

            The .mkv video files play well, installing a codec is not necessary because in one of the post links above states that installing a codec will not fix the thumbnail problem. The issue is that Windows 10 April 2018 update contains a bug that prevents these
 thumbnails and video property details when I right click the video file and navigate to details tab, from loading and displaying. This issue affect many users of the latest update they have complained in many non Microsoft forums.&nbsp; In the same post link a
 user installed Icaros thumbnails which fixes the problem as long as the program is installed. I recommend that Microsoft should troubleshoot the cause of the problem since it is affecting many users and provide a fix in the next cumulative update.

            This problem remains unfixed in the latest Windows 10 April 2018 update which is OS Build 17134.228. I hope Microsoft is troubleshooting this problem and providing a solution to this problem which will not involve installation of third party thumbnail
 generator like Icaros thumbnails.

I used Icaros, a free software program. Works perfectly. Look for "Icaros safe download" on Google.<br />

            I have installed Icaros thumbnails because it seems Microsoft will never fix this problem in 1803. It works perfectly. Windows 10 October 2018 also fixes the issue but I rolled back to 1803 because of the update's problems I experienced such as the Missing
 troubleshooters in the settings app which are the Blue Screen and Hardware and Devices troubleshooters and other problems in this&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-october-2018-update-problems-after/baf18607-ddc7-46ca-a9d8-9a6a00f0d18f" title="Other 1809 problems">link</a>&nbsp;like

<p>I can testify that the issue is in no way, shape or form resolved with Windows 10 October 2018.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update brought back a small amount of .mkv support, but the majority still don't display thumbnails. I think this is because it all depends upon the type of codecs used when creating the mkv file as they are all not the same. All mkv files play in Windows
 10 as of October 2018, it's just the majority aren't able to generate a thumbnail preview.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hey guys! I have faced this problem from yesterday, the partition Windows is sitting on turn to RAW&nbsp;and now it's solved by me without help from Microsoft! I was talking with Microsoft support but she said my EliteBook 8560p not have compatible drivers for
 Windows 10!&nbsp;They affect to the Upgrade, but&nbsp;I don't mind! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I re-installed Windows 7 and activate again then start the Upgrade with Windows 10 disc, ... (by running setup.exe in root directory of the&nbsp;disc, you can skip installing drivers, update... for your Windows 7 to saving time). After choosing few options for
 the Upgrade and wait for it done of&nbsp;it's works, Windows go restart my PC.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;At this point, I power down my PC to prevent Windows 10 start the Upgrade then&nbsp;clone my Windows 7 with pre-upgrade&nbsp;to an External HDD using Norton&nbsp;Ghost, connect&nbsp;that External HDD to VMware virtual machine and lets the Upgrade complete on virtual pc. After
 Windows 10 Upgrade is done (at&nbsp;first setup or already logged-in Desktop), turn off the virtual machine &amp;&nbsp;clone bootable Windows 10 partition&nbsp;back to my primary HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Now I'm&nbsp;having working and Activated Windows 10 Pro &amp; can doing clean install also!</p>

<h2>            Trying to get my daughter playing on Minecraft</h2>
                    <p>I've created a child account for her under my Microsoft Live account. She's got on to Minecraft (on her phone) but when she tries to add a server, it's saying she 'cannot play online multiplayer through Xbox Live because of how [her] account is set up.'
 It then says 'This can be changed in your privacy and online safety settings on Xbox .com. I've signed in on xbox.com but cannot see anything I can change to make this work. There is no menu option with that name.</p>

<p>I've got two whipper-snappers, myself, who love to play Minecraft, so I've been down this same road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since she's trying to add a server and not a realm (let me know if I'm wrong there), the settings that you're most likely looking for in the Privacy and Online Safety Settings (<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">since
 she's playing PE, easiest way to get to those settings is via Xbox.com following these steps</a>):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Xbox One/Windows 10 Enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can play with people outside of Xbox Live</li><li>Share outside of Xbox Live</li><li>Join Multiplayer Games</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Under Privacy Enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see and upload community creations</li><li>You can communicate outside of Xbox Live with voice and Text</li></ul>
<p>And that SHOULD allow her to play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If she's trying to add a realm, or on an Xbox console, that will be different options, such as adding permissions for clubs and her account would need Xbox Live Gold, so let us know if the parameters change, or if you have any questions about what I've covered
 above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck, and hope she's having fun building soon!</p>

<h2>            Windows flashing every 5 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having a weird problem that I thought started after a windows 8.1 automatic/critical update. After the first time this update installed my browser and any window I open in desktop began flashing off and back on again about every 5 seconds. As well
 as the flickering just being annoying, this stops me being able to type withot missing out letters and I can't use drop down menus/ my favourites etc. because they vanish as if I have clicked off them before I can get anywhere. My system is also incredibly
 slow now. If I just have the mouse on desktop it also flashes up with the loading circle every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for viruses etc. but the scan said there are no threats. I then did system restore to last known good point, which fxed the problems. A few days later the update reinstalled itself automatically and the same problems started again. I tried the
 system restore again but this time it has not worked. Also sometimes the windows are not coming back on again automatically now so I have to reclick on the screen/ window I am tryin o use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very grateful for any help please!</p>

            <p>I've got a 64 bit version of windows 8.1, which is what the pc came with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem hasn't happened before and I haven't had any failed updates or error messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed this update for the second time on the 23rd of April, I would say the first time was probably around the 18th. The update number is: KB2565063.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month I installed the free trial version of Kaspersky when I was experiencing different problems and prior to that I only had Windows defender. Kaspersky made no noticeable difference so I uninstalled it and planned to carry with defender. (In the meantime
 I sorted out those problems). I used defender to scan the computer after the first time I installed this update and the problems started and it found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 23rd I tried to scan the computer again but it said Windows defender was turned off. I tried to turn it back on but it will not. When I press the turn on button it begins loading, but I don't think it has enough time to complete the process before

            <p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>AVG</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</li></ul>
<p>Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Had the 30-day Kaspersky free-trial already expired by the time you replaced it with AVG Free?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did you uninstall the Kaspersky application &amp; reboot before you installed AVG Free?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is KB3038314, KB3042553, KB3045999, KB3045685, and/or KB3037579 (<em>and possibly&nbsp;KB3044374</em>)&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>8a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v17.0.0.169 </strong><em>for Internet Explorer</em> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>10. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities;&nbsp;AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser;
 SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's
<em>Registry Cleaner </em>component)?</p>

            <p>1. How long had the Kaspersky free-trial been expired by the time you replaced it with AVG on Friday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does the second line of text in IE11 Help } About read <strong>Update Versions: 11.0.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">08</span> (KB3038314)</strong> or

<p>

[1] Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

</p><p>1. Are you absolutely, positively, <em>100% <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
certain</span></em> that neither a Norton free-trial nor a McAfee free-trial came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it in September 2013?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having exactly the same problems with my &nbsp;ASUS (laptop S550C))</p>
<p>Very similar timing too! &nbsp;In my case the ASUS PC came with the free offer to install McAfffee - I cannot recall whether &nbsp;I ever accepted it though! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Norton 360 installed and have used it for maintenance including Registry Clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have raised a different thread to this one under my name ... but no real solutions offered at this stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will investigate&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">update number is: KB2565063 and would ask the Community 3 questions</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Can I UNINSTALL KB2565063 individually and what risks would this pose?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. IF I have 'overtrusted' Norton Registry Clean .... what is the best way to repair Registry?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. I have captured the message below. I'm unsure whether this is the CAUSE of my problems OR simply a SYMPTOM?</span></p>
