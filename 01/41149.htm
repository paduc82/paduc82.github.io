<h2>            Unable to access D&#58; drive, receives error&#58; &#34;Location is not available. D&#58; &#47; drive is not accessible. Access is denied&#34;.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Windows 7 --- Error:&nbsp; "Location is not available. D:/ drive is not accessible. Access is denied".</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 7 Home premium OS in my laptop. </p>
<div>I had configured such that the D: drive is accessible only in admin mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Now, even if I login in admin mode, I'm not able to access the D: drive. I'm getting an error message as</div>
<div>&nbsp;"Location is not available. D:/ drive is not accessible. Access is denied".&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;If I check in the "Disk management", I can see that the drive is Healthy" and ~50% occupied (which is expected).</div>
<div>&nbsp;Could you please help me to solve this.? </div>

<h2>            A-DATA Classic CH94 1TB Black External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Formatting this drive on W7 and 2008 server takes about 6.5 hours.</p>
<p>On an old Steam Powered XP machine with 512mb RAM it takes 14 minutes<br />
On 2003 Server R2 it takes 12 minutes.<br />
In both these cases I am “not” using quick format. And am using NTFS.<br />
I have 10 of these drives to be used for external backup drives so don’t think it is a one off problem with the hardware.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions on getting a bit more action out of W7 and 2008.</p>

I think this is more about the drivers for the A-Data hard drive or it's drivers rather than the entire Microsoft Operating System(s) described.</p>
<p>To this point the only other driver listed on the Adata.com.tw site is for Windows 98.</p>
<p>It looks like A-Data want someone else to be responsible for managing the drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi MadMike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand why you are mad, but you were given 3 or more months of notice to opt out of the upgrade. There a number of ways forward for you from here. While Windows 10 is not compatible with really old software, anything that ran on Windows 7 and onward
 should work just fine. If it doesn't there are a number of things you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Find the program you that is having issues in File Explorer, right click on the executable and select 'Troubleshoot Compatibility". This will trigger a program that will try to find any issues with this software. When it does find something try running
 it with the recommended options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Run the program by emulating another version of Windows. Find the program in the File Explorer, right click on the executable and select "Properties". From the compatibility tab select the "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select the version
 of Windows you upgraded from. If that doesn't work select the version prior to the version you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b110ae7a-a04e-4f86-824e-157482bdab04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b110ae7a-a04e-4f86-824e-157482bdab04" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If the above 2 methods don't yield the desired results you can go back to the previous version of Windows you had installed from the recovery panel. This option will be available to you for 30 days after you upgraded to Windows 10. You will find that
 instructions on how to do this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Please keep in mind that rolling back to the previous version means you opt out from the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you go and good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sam</p>

            <p>I disagree that people should be required to opt out of a Win10 upgrade. It's akin to blaming the</p>
<p>victim of a crime for their lack of knowledge or poor observation.</p>
<p>This is a shameful bully boy tactic employed by MS as they try to force as many people as possible onto Win10.
</p>
<p>People should be given an option to opt into Win10, not the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will guess that your issue has to do with another Big Brother 'feature' MS has foisted on an</p>
<p>unsuspecting public - DRM Blocking. </p>
<p>This malware developed by MS prevents many <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disk based games</span> from launching.</p>
<p>You can read more details in my post in&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>- This DRM Blocking malware is the only thing that makes games that were playable on Win7 unplayable</p>
<p>on Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If you manage to get back to Win7&nbsp; change your Windows Updates to manual. </p>
<p>Uninstall the updates below if they are still listed in Programs and Features &gt; View Windows Updates.</p>
<p>Reboot after uninstalling the updates and run Windows Updates again.</p>
<p>Go through the list and R/click on these updates and select&nbsp; "<em>Hide</em>". This should prevent Windows Updates</p>
<p>from offering them again. Remain vigilant, at least until the 'free' Win10 offer has expired.
</p>
<p>Some are for Win8, but all relate to the Win10 upgrade (many are for system information gathering)<br />

            <p>I'm not sure who you are replying to, but I'll assume it's to me. The Windows 10 upgrade was delivered as a recommended update to Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 versions of the operating system. Seeing as it was a major update Microsoft provided a few months notice
 whether to accept or decline the update. This is in line with EULA that is agreed to when the operating system is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally Microsoft doesn't alter non-Microsoft software and there is no feature called DRM blocking in the Windows operating system? The thread you linked to is basically people raising an issue that pirated or altered software no longer works in Windows
 10. I don't know how this is an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the updates (KB articles) you have listed have anything to do with 'DRM blocking' or anything even closely related.</p>

            <p>I was responding to MadMike. I may have accidentally clicked on your post instead of MM's</p>
<p>when <em>Submit</em> failed (I had to copy/paste after reloading the page, which often happens if you take</p>
<p>a long time to compose and submit a post).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Seeing as it was a major update Microsoft provided a few months notice whether to accept or decline the update."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not good enough that MS require people to become computer literate, and force an 'upgrade' from</p>
<p>Win7/8/8.1 automatically.&nbsp; No! Automatically upgrading people to Win10 is arrogant in the extreme.</p>
<p>This is the first time a new version of Windows has been delivered via Windows Updates.</p>
<p>Users have a right <em>not</em> to be forced to use Win10 due to possible complacency in regard to the prompts to
</p>
<p>upgrade to Win10. Many don't have a clue how to disable the prompt, much less reject the 'upgrade' offer.</p>
<br />
<p>You and I may not have an issue with this as we are interested in PC's, but believe me there are millions who just want to switch their machine on and have it work, with as little input from the user as possible.
</p>
<p>Their minds go blank and their eyes cloud over when you try to explain something about PC and the basic</p>
<p>workings of Windows to them.&nbsp; That's OK ! If they want to take their machine to a tech every time it</p>
<p>starts running slow because they don't want to learn, that's their choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Freedom of choice is what I'm on about, but many of these people have been 'upgraded' against their wishes.&nbsp; Disastrously, as evidenced by many threads in these and other forums.</p>
This is wrong!&nbsp; Stuff the EULA that most people don't read or understand if they did, myself included.<br />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"and there is no feature called DRM blocking?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There<em> is </em>a 'feature' which prevents many many&nbsp; disk based games that use either SecuROM or SafeDiskfrom launching. This is built into Win10 and provided surreptitiously via Window updates to unsuspecting</p>
<p>Win7/8/8.1 users via the "Security" updates listed in my post (how many people read the full description</p>
<p>of what every update does ? ).</p>
<p>DRM Blocking does not alter anything. It does not prevent people from installing their disk based games ,</p>
<p>it simply prevents any game with the <em>secdrv.sys</em> file on the disk from launching.
</p>
<p>DRM Blocking also does not prevent people from installing and running a pirated game.

<p>In fact that is the other option to not paying for a game you bought on disk again, should they be so inclined.</p>
btw - I don't condone pirates and have reported a number of posts from people seeking help
<p>with blatantly pirated games on both the Win7 and Win10 forums. </p>
<p>Particularly when they refuse to accept their 'black box' or similar version is not a pirated software
</p>
<p>(some world regions have nothing but pirated software on sale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In Win10 the only way to circumvent DRM Blocking is to use a noCD fix/patch/hack, because
</p>
<p>this sidesteps the disk check.</p>
<p>MS has taken a Big Brother stance on DRM Blocking in not allowing freedom of choice by not including</p>
<p>an option in Win10 to disable DRM Blocking.</p>
<p>In Win7 you can either uninstall this this update, or use a command to switch it on/off.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It has to do with being able to use legitimate disk based game collections.

            <p>Hi Boss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on the upgrade method used by Microsoft. Three months notice to opt out of the upgrade is sufficient, but that's debatable. I have checked all the KB articles you have quoted and none of them are for DRM. You mentioned
 SecuROM which is a DRM technology from Sony. This is no longer supported by Windows 10 and was patched out in previous versions of Windows because it introduced security vulnerabilities to the operating system. This behaviour was intentional, however if you'd
 like to play those games you can go back to your previous version of Windows from the recovery console and remove any KBs that were installed. Support for SecuROM was removed with SP1 for Windows 7.</p>

<p>I hate having to stuff around with the disk . Prior to Win10&nbsp; I've had a handful of games that use a DRM

<h2>            Signing in</h2>
                    Hi, I've had a Skype account for over ten years, which I regularly use. I always sign in by clicking on the Skype icon and then typing in my Skype password. Recently it's been asking me to sign in via my Microsoft account (which I presume is my hotmail
 address) so I do that and it says it doesn't recognise my email or username. After trying various login combinations it said that it would send a code to my hotmail address to change the password but the code never arrived. So I gave my second hotmail address
 and then it automatically created a new Skype account and started importing random people into my new skype, but I don't want to use this new one associated with my other hotmail account. I want to use my original Skype. Apparently I can delete my new Skype
 but then a message comes up saying it will delete my Microsoft account. I still want to keep both my hotmail addresses, I just don't want my Skype to linked to my secondary hotmail address. How do I get back my original Skype?

            Hello Polsss.<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear you're facing such difficulty. I know that it is very frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new Skype is still under development and is lacking many of the features and functions users have come to expect. It is also full of many bugs.<br /><br />Wow there is not yet and ETA, it is expected that in the near future Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for Skype that will add features and functions as well as correct any known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future so that users who wish to return to the features and functions they have come to know may do so. If you are interested in returning to Classic Skype it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br />I hope this is helpful to you.

<p>
</p><p>However, I don't appear to be able to log in with the new details, log on does ask for tel # as well as above- is there a constraint within skype given tel # is same for both personal and is requested for this "new" incoming access. Have obviously logged

<h2>            Maxtor OneTouch 4</h2>
                    <p>During the preview version of Win10 I was able to find Win10 drivers that worked on Seagate's official site. &nbsp;Now that the Win10 is released the OneTouch 4 isn't recognized. &nbsp;Kindly help me understand why drivers worked during preview phase but won't work
 on release version. &nbsp;This is not fair to the consumer now, boatloads of people will have to buy new external drives if there is no driver support. &nbsp;If there are Win10 drivers for this device please give me the link to them. &nbsp;I surely will download ASAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for Maxtor OneTouch 4</p>
<p>Model: ST3750528AS, Serial: 6VPC5S58, Firmware: HP35</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If I am understanding what you are saying, there is not an option for&nbsp;right click.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click means to press the button on the right side of your mouse or track ball.&nbsp; So put your cursor on the properties tab and use the right button to click on it.&nbsp; It will give you the additional options.&nbsp;

            I had this same issue but mine wouldn't work regardless of operating system. I tried everything listed in several different posts, no luck. I finally decided to try a different usb cable that I had laying around and boom it now works like a champ windows
 10 spotted it right away. My original cable was the mickey mouse dual usb port type cable that the mini 4 came with which was always a pain in the butt to get working. I hope this helps some with a similar issue. The usb cable I used was a single usb. I am
 not sure what it powered in the past perhaps an old phone or something but if you have one laying around give it a try this fixed my issue.<br />

<h2>            My cd&#47;dvd drive is not being read</h2>
                    
<p>I think it is a Hitachi ATA devivce, but only this shows up in Device manager under disk drives. There is no actual reference to CD/DVD Rom there.</p>
<p>I have been trying suggestions that I have read, including going into the registry and deleting the upper and lower filters.Although this worked long enough for me to upgrade my Vista system to Windows 7, it hasn't recognised it again since, even though
 I deleted the filters again after the upgrade. Can anyone hel me please?</p>

            Thanks Shinmila. Although the cd driver was solved in that the optical drive was shot and I needed another drive fitted, they did comment that the computer was slow and it really needed a repeat of the upgrade, I will follow your suggestion as to the new
 drivers through and i tank you for that. I also thank SpiritX for your suggestions, which I carried out and you did mention that it might be a corrupt drive.

            Hi MagdalenaHržić,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Try to type the first few letters of the apps name in Cortana search and see whether you get it.
<br />
<br />2. Open Microsoft Store, search for the app. If you already own that, you will get launch button for that. Try to launch them from Store.
<br />
<br />3. Reset Windows Store through Command Prompt
<br />Type cmd in Windows Search box &gt; Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type WSreset.exe and click Enter  &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

 saying cant be romvd because of outstnding balance but there isnt on my dads card but i havent been able to purchase a xbl gold membership since 3 weeks ago when i asked my friends for 1 and i got 1 but my internet went off about 3-5 days later but i knew
 it would go off because of phone bill not being paid but after my internet got put back on i couldnt purchase a membership so another one of my friends bought me a 14 day free trial and it was finished yesterday but i still cant purchase a membership using

            <p>You will need to contact Phone Support about this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>From what you describe, the most likely scenario is that the service tried to bill the card, but there being no money it failed. Thus there is the mentioned outstanding balance and there is probably a financial risk block on the account (the 'cannot complete purchase right now' error message).</p>
<p>You can get rid of the outstanding balance yourself by adding a valid payment option to the account, to which it will be charged. You can then remove the previous card.</p>
<p>However, if there is that financial risk block, it will become necessary to get in touch with Phone Support.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Klondike Daily Challenge 7&#47;19&#47;2014</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When playing the Klondike Daily Challenge, the number of Jacks I played to the foundation would not register, even though I successfully played the game (2 Jacks in less than 95 moves). &nbsp;I completed the other Daily Challenges without a problem, so the problem
 is only with this challenge. &nbsp;I'm using Windows 8 on an HP desktop system. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Me, too. &nbsp;I have not upgraded to 8.1 as when I tried that before my pc crashed and I lost important programs when the losers at the Geek Squad tried to restore me. &nbsp;Microsoft told me not to try to upgrade as 8.1 wasn't ready for prime time. &nbsp;They said they'd
 let me know when to try again but in 11 months I haven't heard back from them. &nbsp;So forget trying in 8.1 for me. &nbsp;Please fix 8 so my 2 jacks in less than 95 moves will register.</p>

<p>I,too,have the same problem in Windows 8. &nbsp;I solved it yesterday in 84 moves and like everyone else, it did not register that the challenge was complete. &nbsp;I solved it again today and it's still not registering. &nbsp;Will this be fixed by the end of the month?
 &nbsp;It's very frustrating to solve an Expert challenge, only to have it not register as a win.

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We have determined that there is indeed an issue with this Daily Challenge on Windows 8 machines. A fix is being uploaded shortly that will remove the "move requirement" so that this can be solved. If you're having this issue on a Windows 8.1 machine (which you shouldn't), please make certain that your Windows 8.1 is completely updated:</p>
<p>1.	Press the Windows key</p>
<p>2.	Type in Windows Update</p>
<p>3.	Under the search bar you see on the right, choose Check for Updates</p>
<p>4.	In the Windows Update screen, press the Check Now button</p>
<p>5.	Even if it doesn't seem to find any updates, click on View Details</p>
<p>6.	Install any updates you see that haven't been installed- including optional ones</p>
<p>7.	Restart using the restart option from the shutdown menu.</p>
<p>Then please try these steps:</p>
<p>1.	Press Windows Key + R</p>
<p>2.	In the box, type wsreset.exe &nbsp;and press Enter</p>
<p>3.	This will re-launch the Windows Store</p>
<p>4.	Hover over the right-hand side to bring up the charm bar</p>
<p>5.	Choose Settings</p>
<p>6.	Choose App Updates</p>
<p>7.	Choose Sync licenses</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we are sorry for the inconvenience this puzzle has caused and will have that fix out to you all as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>            Hp Quick Launch Buttons install problem</h2>
                    
<p>When I first ran the Win7 Advisor it told me that my Hp Quick Launch Buttons were not compatible and the software needed to be removed before install. I used the windows install/uninstall program to remove it and rebooted. The problem is it still keeps saying
 I need to remove the HP Quick Launch Buttons before installation even after I already removed it. I have been unable to find a solution and I have tried a few things that obviously did not work else I would not be here.<br />
<br />
1. reinstalled software then removed again<br />
2. ran windows clean uninstall utility ( forget the exact name )<br />
3. ran a registry cleaner<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated</p>

            Run msconfig, the Startup tab may have a checkbox to uncheck for that. Also remove any folder named for that in C:\Program Files\

<h2>            Why wasn&#39;t Spider Solitaire included in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The solitaire collection that Microsoft offers in Windows 10 is poor. You cannot choose whether to replay or start a new Spider Solitaire game, for example.&nbsp; Why didn't they keep the popular Spider Solitaire in previous versions of Windows? Had I known,
 I would not have upgraded.&nbsp; I cannot find it anywhere to download. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And, why can't I find a way to ask Microsoft directly?</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Graphics driver intel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louferjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Graphics driver intel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am very confused here. I go on the website and search for graphic drivers for my surface pro 2. It comes up with a driver for the 4th gen 4400 graphic card:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Version: 15.40.10.64.4300<br />
DATE: October 16, 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my actual driver on the my system, it is model number 10.18.15.4256 with the date of 7/17/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which means I should be able to update my driver right?</p>
<p>I cant, doesn't allow me says system is not compatible. Also why cant I find my intel graphics control panel to open so I can adjust settings for my monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need some answers please. Am I with the up to date driver for my SP2 for 2016?</p>
<p>If so how can I get my intel graphics panel up for adjustments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>windows 10, current build</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>MS removed that feature from the package it gives us a while ago, supposedly for performance reasons.&nbsp; The only remaining trace of it is the icon.&nbsp; E.g. in Settings search for HD and find Intel HD Graphics, try and open it and get back Settings as if you
 hadn't done anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think you are on the right track to try to find and install a more recent driver that Intel provide for our device.&nbsp; Probably the problem with trying to use it is that it is not signed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heh.&nbsp; Look what MS have on the Catalog site.&nbsp; But for what?&nbsp; I imagine it will be signed though.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/ScopedViewInline.aspx?updateid=ec5b465e-43f0-4028-9e72-41ad48999cde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/ScopedViewInline.aspx?updateid=ec5b465e-43f0-4028-9e72-41ad48999cde</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Catalog search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intel video 4400</p>
<p>-sorted by Last Updated descending<br />
)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even bigger version number than your "web search" turned up.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>20.19.15.4360.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that it says "for Windows 10 and later"&nbsp;but it doesn't mention Surface.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you finding out your applied version?&nbsp; FWIW I just tried using Settings, Display, Advanced Display Settings, Display Adapter Properties and and got told&nbsp;"Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate
 permissions to access the item."</p>
<p>
</p><p>That happens even when I try starting from Administrator:&nbsp; Windows PowerShell</p>
<p>PS&gt;explorer.exe ms-settings:display</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get more permissions than that?&nbsp; However, I am aware that explorer.exe does tend to strip the Elevated status off its tasks, so I suppose I should try to find an alternate method of doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; I got something that matches your applied version&nbsp;using msinfo32.exe Components, Display</p>
<p>Driver Version&nbsp;10.18.15.4256</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, who knows?&nbsp; Maybe we are just getting a peek at something that will be offered to us normally (eventually).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I installed the driver (20.19.15.4300)&nbsp;on the intel website manually... wasn't that difficult but now it offered the HD graphics panel to adjust my resolution and what not. I see what you are saying by MS doesn't offer any help on the downloads. I just
 wish they didn't falsely advertise. When you say the SURFACE PRO 2 displays 4k in 60hz and doesn't actually do that, there is a big problem and means for law arguments. They need to hop on INTEL to get their cards updated because there is a huge uproar on
 other forums....

                    <p>Hi!<br />
Can somebody from MS give a proper answer how to solve the problem after an update when windows 10 run's in an infinitive loop of Automatic repair?</p>
<p><br />
My OS is Windows 10 x64</p>
<p>Here is the log file snippet:</p>

<p>
</p><p>What is the right solution to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Please don't post "reinstall the OS" or similar.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with that kind of solving.</p>

            Hi Chris
<br />
<br />If the Automatic Repair process itself is unsuccessful, your best option is to reinstall Windows 10 manually.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Hi Chris:,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Hmmm....<br />
The major problem is does I don't have an install disk with the PC because the PC was bought with the windows preinstalled, no cd/dvd beside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows is a genuine copy and is in my company where I work.</p>
<p>How can I now reinstall my windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a sys. admin in that company and others also.</p>
<p>As I figured out this type of problem is well common in win10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm afraid does I will have huge problems in other companies too where I'm the sys. admin</p>
<p>but I can't do nothing to prevent this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe to reinstall 10-20-30 PC and all that specific softwares which are installed too</p>
<p>with all that setups on it etc. just because MS mage such of bugs in their OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Startup repair is not working</p>
<p>2. Safe mode is not entering</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the best way to transfer this crashed system to a virtual machine?</p>
<p>so I can safe try to solve the problem without making the real system worse.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Account Username</h2>
                    So I made an Xbox Live account, right from my new Xbox. But I forgot I had a Windows 10 Xbox account, and would like to use my Windows 10 username. I can still change my Xbox Live account username but it is taken by the Windows 10 account. I know that
 I could of used the Windows 10 account but its too late now because I have purchased Xbox Live on the console. Any idea how I can change my Xbox username to the one I have on Windows 10. *Not by paying to change the username, and its okay to delete the Windows
 10 account if that meant the username would become available.*&nbsp;&nbsp;

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />c
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />So, if its a different computer, you will need to purchase an all new license. 
<br />
<br />If its the same machine, you would have install Windows 10 Pro, not Home.

            I am trying to import a CD through what was the D drive but there is no longer a D drive option. I opened itunes and could not find anyway to open the CD or import it. I did not receive an error message. After taking the Cd out and putting it back in several
 times there was no response at all. I could not find a way in Windows Media Center either. I am using a Dell Latitude E5520. I found out that Windows 10 does not have DVD use without buying an additional app. Is the issue with the Cd the same?

            <p>Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from your additional comments, the problem seems to be that nothing on your computer recognises that the CD drive itself exists.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so then go to the Dell support website, get the latest driver they have for your CD drive then install it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if there is still a problem,&nbsp;look in Device manager and find your CD drive in the list of disk&nbsp;drives then right-click on its entry &amp; select
<em>Update driver</em> - this will prompt Windows update to check the existing driver and see if it can find a better one.</p>

            I went to Dell to get driver updates. Dell says that there are no driver or device updates needed on my computer. You did not respond to my question about Windows 10 supporting playing DVDs and CDs. If it does not it will not matter if my drivers are up
 to date. I also found that I cannot use the USB port that I have been using to back up client files on an external hard drive. Since none of these function I would like to take Windows 10 off of my computer and return to my old operating system. Can you tell
 me how to do that?

            <p>I also went to the Device Manager and right clicked on the driver. It said that there is no update needed. Again, I don't think that Windows 10 support any external devices - CD, DVD, or USB ports. I have an expensive Embroidery Design Software program that
 needs to use the USB port to allow it to open. If this cannot be resolved I would like for you to tell how to uninstall Window 10 and return to my previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From looking at the others who have the same problem it seems that they are not willing to say that Windows 10 does not support CD use. Either they don't know are aren't willing to say.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Disk Mirror Throws Not Enough Space Available</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Pro and when attempting&nbsp;to Mirror the existing&nbsp;Disk 0 to a new Unallocated Disk 1 that is the exact same disk in size, manufacturer, model etc as Disk 0 I am getting the error 'There is not enough space available on the disk to complete
 this operation'.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried adding a extra 1G at&nbsp;the end of Disk 0 (by shrinking it some some) and still get the same error.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried both the 'Add mirror' (right click on the partition on Diks 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;and Right Clicking on Disk 1 for 'Add Mirrorred Volume'
 wizard and get the same error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second drive (Disk 1) is Dynamic and Disk 0 it Basic.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the Windows message that Disk 0 will be converted to Dynamic which I expect and reply OK to the question (knowing that both disks will need to be Dynamic).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I have tried it with Disk 1 being Basic and still get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached is picture of the Windows Disk Management error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying different options for the past several days and have search many forums with no&nbsp; solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope someone can help.</p>

            <p>The Disk Defragmenter (Analysis showed 0% fragmented) and CHKDSK&nbsp;ran fine with&nbsp;no issues but the problem of not being able to mirror the Disk 0 to Disk 1 continues.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Add Mirror or the Add Mirror Volume is run the standard expected messages are
 displayed&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) which Disk to mirror to and Disk 1 is selected and then&nbsp;2) Disk 0 will be converted to Dynamic, and do you want to continue and the after replying Yes then the not enough disk space is available.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if it has something to do with getting free spaced added to Disk 0 (1GB) or Disk 1(1GB) but when I tried this it didn't help since Dynamic disk need this area.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am missing something very easy but can't figure it out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased two exact disks so that they would be the same.&nbsp; The screenshot from&nbsp;Windows Disk Management might&nbsp;help someone to see the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Has anyone recieved a solution for this problem yet? I am using 2 500gb SSD's with new installation(Windows 10) and a "not enough free space" error when attempting to mirror the first partition using Windows 10. I experienced this problem b4 but only when
 it came time for the last partition which is easy to correct by shrinking the volume. This job is being done using the MBR partitions.

    <title>Intel Compute Stick - Windows 10 Build 1511 failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Compute Stick  - Windows 10 Build 1511 failure</h2>
                    <p>I bought an Intel Compute Stick last Sept and was able to successfully upgrade to Win 10. However, when Build 1511 came along, it bricked the ICS and even destroyed the recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this is a known issue and supposedly there is a patch for the previous build of Win 10 to move up to the Autumn build 1511. However, there is no clear solution for moving directly to&nbsp;build 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a replacement ICS&nbsp;under warranty (as the original was completely bricked) but this is running Win 8.1.</p>
<p>No license key is given with these (or at least not that I could find!)</p>
<p>However, the Intel Compute Stick keeps failing/stalling during the install phase so it keeps reverting back to 8.1.
</p>
<p>I can't use the Media Creation Tool image (which I have created) since the ICS doesn't have an activated version of WIndows 10 on it.....Catch 22!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to install a previous version of Win10 to get it authorised/activated and then patch it to do the full upgrade to 1511?</p>
<p>Can I get MS to manually activate it by quoting the Windows 8.1 Product ID? The ICS doesn't come with a License code so I can't enter it. Is Magical Jelly Bean a legal program&nbsp;to extract the license code??</p>
<p>
</p><p>VERY frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help in this!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am posting here is related to Windows 10 and the activation in order to migrate to build 1511 since I can't install the patch required to previous builds of Windows 10 as the ICS is running Win 8.1 and upgrades now go straight to build 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that on the face of it that the Intel Community is the obvious&nbsp;place to go first. I have been there and there are countless people like me facing the same problem with no apparent solution available to us. However, those who already had the
 previous build of Win 10 working, were able to apply a MS patch which then allowed the migration to build 1511 using Media Creation Tool. I am hoping to try this approach but still need some way of getting an older build of Win 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully extracted the CD Key using Magic Jelly Bean so can use Media Creation Tool to do a clean install and enter the CD key to activate an older version of Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need to know is if it is possible to get access to a previous build of WIndows 10 that I can then patch to enable the final progression to build 1511?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel community indicates that the BIOS needs to be upgraded to the latest version (0031) which I have done and reset the ICS to factory state with Windows 8.1 in order to ensure the installation is all clean. Intel don't seem to have a fix and simply
 offer warranty replacements for bricked devices - not useful given that we start from scratch again with Windows 8.1 and being unable to upgrade to Windows 10 without it stalling during either the Installation of drivers phase or the Finalising Settings phase.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for some kind of response from MS on this - the Intel forums document the issue very clearly and it is very definitely a Windows issue getting from previous builds of Windows 10 (which work perfectly well) to Build 1511. I followed all
 the suggestions on the Intel forum.</p>
<p>The BIOS is the very latest, I was able to get a previous build of Windows 10 activated on the ICS and have all the very latest drivers installed. The SD card was removed as recommended on the forum.
</p>
<p>Up to this point an old build of Windows 10 works fine on the ICS.</p>
<p>I then created a Recovery USB drive of this "stable" Windows 10 state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used my USB Media version (created using Media Creation Tool) to bring the machine up to build 1511. It gets up to 98%&nbsp;during Installing Features...and then HANGS. I left the ICS overnight. So I had to power off and power on. Unit won't boot. Recovery
 partition doesn't work. </p>
<p>The only option was to use the Recovery Media to get back to the Previous Windows 10 build. All working fine.
</p>
<p>How is it possible that I can build an old version of Windows 10 and yet as soon as I try to get to 1511 it breaks the device?</p>
<p>Something has obviously changed - I don't see how this is not a Windows build 1511 issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Jan 29 update which may help someone at MS give an answer why this build fails whereas previous builds were fine - to me this says very clearly that something changed with Windows therefore this MUST be a MS issue to look into:Following Intel's recommended
 method will get a complete install past Stage 3 (Configuring Settings) to the&nbsp;Default Screen with the login prompt. After Login, you get&nbsp;past "Just Finalising A Few Things" or whatever it says ... then &nbsp;"We'll Be Ready Soon" before the system hangs again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i) Use Media Creation Tool for the appropriate version (i.e. 32bit Windows 10 Home)</p>
<p>(As mentioned above in my previous method) and copy the .iso to a USB drive.</p>
<p>ii) Get latest BIOS, latest drivers, remove SD card.</p>
<p>iii) MOST IMPORTANT STEP: Create a RECOVERY DISC!</p>
<p>iv) Run the upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>v) Select 2nd option which is Keep Personal Files Only (DON'T select "Remove Everything" or "Keep Settings and Personal Files)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK having done this gets the system to finish the upgrade, all the reboots etc to the point where you have to Login and finalise the settings and installing the apps. THIS is the point where everything hangs with the message "We'll Be Ready Soon... Don't
 Turn Off Your PC"</p>
<p>I left it for several hours in this state hoping it was just damn slow! Nope...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option is to force the ICS to power down by holding down the Power Switch for several seconds. When you try to restart, the unit keeps restarting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW you will be thankful for having the Recovery Media to get you back to a working ICS!</p>
<p>The Recovery Partition is gone. The system won't boot and cannot reset or repair itself.</p>
<p>Only option, go to Recovery Media and start again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK MS...Does this give a clue as to what could be going wrong with the ICS?</p>
<p>Clearly SOMETHING changed with Build 1511. What is happening during the "We'll Be Ready Soon"? Incompatible drivers for the hardware?</p>
<p>Intel are no help so far, but if someone can explain what happens at this stage of the upgrade, we can work this out together! Please? Someone?</p>

            Thanks! I'll give that a try. At the moment I've got&nbsp;the previous version of Win10 running OK. I've selected "delay upgrades" and that at least has enabled me to keep using the device. I still don't understand why Intel and MS have not been able to provide
 any help on this! Not impressed with either of them at the moment.....

            I had same problem this week, almost sent it back. It had signs of life and connected to recovery but no partition ! I had to get an image from my old compute stick different version and it got me to desktop with all generic drivers. Connected eventually
 because the original issue was wireless not working and reset device. Just a note of you do this, "disable firewall and defender" to install drivers, load AVG last. Only go to Intel site don't surf with no security. It took all day to sort it. Now it is better
 because I could "decrapify it" and lean it down with custom install. When you get it perfect "Make Restore Discs" and "System Repair Disc"! Then you will have a long and happy experience ! If I had thought of getting image at first start up, I could have saved
 days of work, but now I know Windows 10 inside and out&nbsp;

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting postscript.... So back when I finally got Win10 working on the replacement Win8.1 ICS, I selected "delay upgrades" in the Windows Update options as I mentioned before. After only getting the critical updates, I recently got a notification of
 "last chance to upgrade". Having ensured I had all the latest drivers using the Intel Driver update tool, I decided to risk it.....Lo and behold I now have 1511 running.
</p>
<p>One of the updates must have fixed something. Anyway, it IS possible to get it going it's just&nbsp;an extremely frustrating process.</p>
<p>BTW Magical JellyBean will enable you to extract the license key. Then you can use a standard ISO to rebuild if you want and then load the extracted license key. This is how I got Win10 (older build) back on to recover the broken install.</p>

            <p>Agree. It took me a few days lol but you can get it up with a restore disc/usb from another Compute Stick even if drivers and chip different ! Then disable defender and firewall to load drivers from Intel Compute Stick Support/Drivers/Downloads page. You
 can "unbrick" Compute Stick with any Windows. 10 disc or 8/8.1 as well, starting from scratch. But the lesson here as in the past "Day 1 make a system image" (usb/disc) and to be double sure a start repair disc or image&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one could lose much data these days with the ease of making copies on externals, but unlike the old days, we can't pull the drive out of compute stick and put it on a external usb interface to retrieve data because it is eMMC not a drive !&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox one X rattling&#47;whirring noise&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well it's certainly quieter than my base PS4, my computer or my fridge, but the Xbox One X I got yesterday is making this rattling sound right out of the box. It's not that loud but I can hear it 3 meters away from the console where I sit. Not so much when
 I'm playing (my TV is closer than the console), but sort of in the background when watching Netflix or youtube.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quess my main problem is that I don't know if this is normal or something of a defect. Has not affected performance as far as I can tell. I'm now thinking that I will either take it back to the store and wait for the PS4 Pro+RDR2 bundle (of course, there's
 no quarantee it won't have the same noise or be louder) or I'm just going to keep for now and maybe with time get used to it. I don't wanna take it to my retailer for maintenance because it take 2-3 weeks and if nothing is actually wrong with it, they will
 bill me.&nbsp;</p>

            In my opinion it's not normal to hear this kind of noise. It seems as if the cooling fan touches something.<br />
