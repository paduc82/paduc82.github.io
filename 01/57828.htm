<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 version 1803 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB4100403&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with this update.&nbsp; I'm showing two updates of the KB4100403 which shows an annotation of "Requires a restart to finish installing" and another which shows "Failed to install on ‎5/‎23/‎2018 - 0x80240034."&nbsp; I've restarted my computer
 a couple times and ran the troubleshooter twice to no avail.&nbsp; I manually downloaded the and tried to update using the stand alone installer but it states the update is already installed.&nbsp; What gives.&nbsp; How do I remove the erroneous information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks like clicking the RESTART REQUIRED button on the Security and Updates page did the trick.</p>
<p>However, we have two accounts and I had to logout of the other account first.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>When your computer hardware appears to power up okay, but the Windows XP operating system won't boot properly, you have to begin a troubleshooting expedition that includes getting into the operating system, determining the problem, and then fixing it. To
 help you get started on this expedition, here are 10 things you can do when Windows XP won't boot.</p>
<span>#1: Use a Windows startup disk</span>
<p>One of the first things you should reach for when troubleshooting a Windows XP boot problem is a Windows startup disk. This floppy disk can come in handy if the problem is being caused when either the startup record for the active partition or the files
 that the operating system uses to start Windows have become corrupted.</p>
<p>To create a Windows startup disk, insert a floppy disk into the drive of a similarly configured, working Windows XP system, launch My Computer, right-click the floppy disk icon, and select the Format command from the context menu. When you see the Format
 dialog box, leave all the default settings as they are and click the Start button. Once the format operation is complete, close the Format dialog box to return to My Computer, double-click the drive C icon to access the root directory, and copy the following
 three files to the floppy disk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot.ini </li><li>NTLDR </li><li>Ntdetect.com </li></ul>
<p>After you create the Windows startup disk, insert it into the floppy drive on the afflicted system and press [Ctrl][Alt][Delete] to reboot the computer. When you boot from the Windows startup disk, the computer will bypass the active partition and boot files
 on the hard disk and attempt to start Windows XP normally.</p>
<span>#2: Use Last Known Good Configuration</span>
<p>You can also try to boot the operating system with the Last Known Good Configuration feature. This feature will allow you to undo any changes that caused problems in the CurrentControlSet registry key, which defines hardware and driver settings. The Last
 Known Good Configuration feature replaces the contents of the CurrentControlSet registry key with a backup copy that was last used to successfully start up the operating system.</p>
<p>To use the Last Known Good Configuration feature, first restart the computer by pressing [Ctrl][Alt][Delete]. When you see the message
<em>Please select the operating system to start</em> or hear the single beep, press [F8] to display the Windows Advanced Options menu. Select the Last Known Good Configuration item from the menu and press [Enter].</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you get only one shot with the Last Known Good Configuration feature. In other words, if it fails to revive your Windows XP on the first attempt, the backup copy is also corrupt.</p>
<span>#3: Use System Restore</span>
<p>Another tool that might be helpful when Windows XP won't boot is System Restore. System Restore runs in the background as a service and continually monitors system-critical components for changes. When it detects an impending change, System Restore immediately
 makes backup copies, called restore points, of these critical components before the change occurs. In addition, System Restore is configured by default to create restore points every 24 hours.</p>
<p>To use System Restore, first restart the computer by pressing [Ctrl][Alt][Delete]. When you see the message
<em>Please select the operating system to start</em> or hear the single beep, press [F8] to display the Windows Advanced Options menu. Now, select the Safe Mode item from the menu and press [Enter].</p>
<p>Once Windows XP boots into Safe mode, click the Start button, access the All Programs | Accessories | System Tools menu, and select System Restore. Because you're running in Safe mode, the only option on the opening screen of the System Restore wizard is
 Restore My Computer To An Earlier Time, and it's selected by default, so just click Next. Then, follow along with the wizard to select a restore point and begin the restoration procedure.</p>
<span>#4: Use Recovery Console</span>
<p>When a Windows XP boot problem is severe, you'll need to use a more drastic approach. The Windows XP CD is bootable and will provide you with access to a tool called Recovery Console.</p>
<p>To boot from the Windows XP CD, insert it into the CD-ROM drive on the problem system and press [Ctrl][Alt][Delete] to reboot the computer. Once the system begins booting from the CD, simply follow the prompts that will allow the loading of the basic files
 needed to run Setup. When you see the Welcome To Setup screen, shown in <strong>
Figure A</strong>, press R to start the Recovery Console.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You'll then see a Recovery Console menu, like the one shown in <strong>Figure B</strong>. It displays the folder containing the operating system's files and prompts you to choose the operating system you want to log on to. Just press the menu number on the
 keyboard, and you'll be prompted to enter the Administrator's password. You'll then find yourself at the main Recovery Console prompt.</p>

<span>#5: Fix a corrupt Boot.ini</span>
<p>As the Windows XP operating system begins to load, the Ntldr program refers to the Boot.ini file to determine where the operating system files reside and which options to enable as the operating system continues to load. So if there's a problem rooted in
 the Boot.ini file, it can render Windows XP incapable of booting correctly.</p>
<p>If you suspect that Windows XP won't boot because Boot.ini has been corrupted, you can use the special Recovery Console version of the Bootcfg tool to fix it. Of course, you must first boot the system with the Windows XP CD and access the Recovery Console
 as described in #4.</p>
<p>To use the Bootcfg tool, from the Recovery Console command prompt, type</p>
<p>Bootcfg /<em>parameter</em></p>
<p>Where <em>/parameter</em> is one of these required parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>/Add--Scans the disk for all Windows installations and allows you to add any new ones to the Boot.ini file.
</li><li>/Scan--Scans the disk for all Windows installations. </li><li>/List--Lists each entry in the Boot.ini file. </li><li>/Default--Sets the default operating system as the main boot entry. </li><li>/Rebuild--Completely re-creates the Boot.ini file. The user must confirm each step.
</li><li>/Redirect--Allows the boot operation to be redirected to a specific port when using the Headless Administration feature. The Redirect parameter takes two parameters of its own, [Port Baudrate ] | [UseBiosSettings].
</li><li>/Disableredirect--Disables the redirection. </li></ul>
<span>#6: Fix a corrupt partition boot sector</span>
<p>The partition boot sector is a small section of the hard disk partition that contains information about the operating system's file system (NTFS or FAT32), as well as a very small machine language program that is crucial in assisting the operating system
 as it loads.</p>
<p>If you suspect that Windows XP won't boot because the partition boot sector has been corrupted, you can use a special Recovery Console tool called Fixboot to fix it. Start by booting the system with the Windows XP CD and accessing the Recovery Console as
 described in #4.</p>
<p>To use the Fixboot tool, from the Recovery Console command prompt, type</p>
<p>Fixboot <em>[drive]</em>:</p>
<p>Where <em>[drive]</em> is the letter of the drive to which you want to write a new partition boot sector.</p>
<span>#7: Fix a corrupt master boot record</span>
<p>The master boot record occupies the first sector on the hard disk and is responsible for initiating the Windows boot procedure. The master boot record contains the partition table for the disk as well as a small program called the
<em>master boot code</em>, which is responsible for locating the active, or bootable, partition, in the partition table. Once this occurs, the partition boot sector takes over and begins loading Windows. If the master boot record is corrupt, the partition boot
 sector can't do its job and Windows won't boot.</p>
<p>If you suspect Windows XP won't boot because the master boot record has been corrupted, you can use the Recovery Console tool Fixmbr to fix it. First, boot the system with the Windows XP CD and access the Recovery Console as described in #4.</p>
<p>To use the Fixmbr tool, from the Recovery Console command prompt, type</p>
<p>Fixmbr [<em>device_name</em>]</p>
<p>Where [<em>device_name</em>] is the device pathname of the drive to which you want to write a new master boot record. For example, the device pathname format for a standard bootable drive C configuration would look like this:</p>
<p>\Device\HardDisk0</p>
<span>#8: Disable automatic restart</span>
<p>When Windows XP encounters a fatal error, the default setting for handling such an error is to automatically reboot the system. If the error occurs while Windows XP is booting, the operating system will become stuck in a reboot cycle--rebooting over and
 over instead of starting up normally. In that case, you'll need to disable the option for automatically restarting on system failure.</p>
<p>When Windows XP begins to boot up and you see the message <em>Please select the operating system to start</em> or hear the single beep, press [F8] to display the Windows Advanced Options Menu. Then, select the Disable The Automatic Restart On System Failure
 item and press [Enter]. Now, Windows XP will hang up when it encounters the error and with any luck, it will display a stop message you can use to diagnose the problem.</p>
<span>#9: Restore from a backup</span>
<p>If you can't seem to repair a Windows XP system that won't boot and you have a recent backup, you can restore the system from the backup media. The method you use to restore the system will depend on what backup utility you used, so you'll need to follow
 the utility's instructions on how to perform a restore operation.</p>
<span>#10: Perform an in-place upgrade</span>
<p>If you can't repair a Windows XP system that won't boot and you don't have a recent backup, you can perform an in-place upgrade. Doing so reinstalls the operating system into the same folder, just as if you were upgrading from one version of Windows to another.
 An in-place upgrade will usually solve most, if not all, Windows boot problems.</p>
<p>Performing a Windows XP in-place upgrade is pretty straightforward. To begin, insert the Windows XP CD into the drive, restart your system, and boot from the CD. Once the initial preparation is complete, you'll see the Windows XP Setup screen (shown earlier
 in Figure A). Press [Enter] to launch the Windows XP Setup procedure. In a moment, you'll see the License Agreement page and will need to press [F8] to acknowledge that you agree. Setup will then search the hard disk looking for a previous installation of
 Windows XP. When it finds the previous installation, you'll see a second Windows XP Setup screen, as shown in
<strong>Figure C</strong>.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Figure C</strong></p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This screen will prompt you to press R to repair the selected installation or to press [Esc] to install a fresh copy of Windows XP. In this case, initiating a repair operation is synonymous with performing an in-place upgrade, so you'll need to press R.
 When you do so, Setup will examine the disk drives in the system. It will then begin performing the in-place upgrade.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that after you perform an in-place upgrade or repair installation, you must reinstall all updates to Windows.</p>

<h2>            Ark Survival Evolved&#58; Windows Store &#40;won&#39;t launch&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded the Windows Store version of Ark Survival Evolved, and I cannot get it to launch. Well, it launches into to default screen like it does for every game you would launch on the store, but it doesn't go any further than that. I've reinstalled
 the game twice, thinking that was the problem, but it didn't work. I've googled around and did all of the common fixes and can't seem to find a fix. I'm on the most up-to-date version of Windows and have the most updated Windows Store. Also, my graphics drivers
 are completely up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know, the game works completely fine on my Desktop at home, but doesn't like to work on my Laptop for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fixes out there for this? Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have better clarity on the issue, answer the below-listed questions and get back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you trying to play the Ark Survival Evolved game on your Windows computer or on your Xbox?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
Post a Screenshot</a> of the game that launches in the default screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try the below methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Fix Problems with Apps from Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix Problems With Apps From Microsoft Store</a> and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot</a> and see if you are facing the same issue with the Ark Survival Evolved game.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A 'Clean Boot' starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 while in a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Clean Boot works, then don't forget to place the computer to normal boot by going to 'Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting' section in the Clean Boot link.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: New User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above methods didn't' work, then you may need to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a New Administrator User Account</a> and launch the game from the New User Account and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>1. I didn't make any changes prior to the install.</p>
<p>2. I'm trying to use the game on my Windows computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of the fixes*, and nothing helped. The only thing that changed is that the splash screen crashes, instead of just hanging like it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also looked in my event logs and found multiple of these errors:</p>
<p>
Unable to start a DCOM Server: StudioWildcard.4558480580BB9_1.20.778.2_x64__1w2mm55455e38!AppARKSurvivalEvolved as Unavailable/Unavailable. The error:<br />
"5"<br />
Happened while starting this command:<br />

</p><p>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I tried making a new account and logging in and it said that I needed to install the game again.... I already have the game installed on my other account on the same computer, why would I need to install it again. The game is almost 80 GB, it would take
 days to install again. I also don't have the space required to have it twice on the same computer.<br />

<h2>            Help &#33; My mail tile &#40;win 8&#41; is not opening properly. Annoying</h2>
                    Well when the default program email opens it displays my total emails only 3 this morning, When i click, it opens and then closes in 1 second, it is displaying&nbsp; a message about password change (for my gmail account which i changed yesterday)but i cannot
 do anything in one second ! It flashes onscreen and then closes down.<br />
I have tried it with live tile off and it made no difference. I am trying to get used to using windows 8 tiles but i am getting more and more frustrated and installing desktop icons which defeats the point of TILES.
<br />
Any suggestions ? <br />
<br />

            Hello, thank you for the reply, ,<br />
In reply to point 1, almost every app i have added that i use has glitched, failed to work properly or operates intermittently to the point that i have to access most from the browser.<br />
point 2, No i have not changed the structure of this laptop.<br />
All i did was access, via the desktop and browser, my outlook to update the password change on my Google mail account., it worked fine in desktop mode however when i went to click the tile screen later on it just opened up and the screen flashed so fast i cannot
 press anything. This morning after a snooze (win8 ,not me ha ha ) my windows 8 outlook tile progressed to opening and to the "we could not access your g mail-enter your password screen" i was able to complete that and it continued its loading process and displayed
 my emails. It then crashed and closed. <br />
<br />
So, I have removed yet another app from the live tile, i only have a few left now !
<br />
Windows 8. great it is not.<br />

            Hi<br />
Thank you for taking the time to reply to my questions ! <br />
I have used the windows app fixer and this said it changed things (security and corrupt files) however there is no difference from accessing email via the tile system, it even created &amp; saved data files-but only Bill gates knows where these went ! - ha ha
<br />
I have only recently - one week ago- restored this laptop from the refresh option, this was due to following issues i had with "xe.xom". "skype" and "bitdefender" tile applications. I rebuilt it with the latest drivers and deleted over 30 other applications
 i had added to my "tiles" .<br />
Thanks for the suggestions, clearly from other users comments i have seen in application and technical reports there are serious issues with "win 8" , it is a shame , i was an eager "beta tester" last year and loved it, i have it on both my laptops but on my
 desktop i will keep windows 7 and just use desktop access for my mail, which even when i could access it from the tile was not pretty to use !
<br />
Thanks <br />

<h2>            Remove Windows 7 Desktop Icon Shadows</h2>
                    
<p>How can I remove the Window 7 desktop icon shadows? Each time that I place the cursor on one of the icons this square shadow appears behind it.</p>
<p>I have tried just abut everything to stop these shadows from appearing.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The solution to removing the desktop icon shadows is to bring up the Performance Options screen and remove the check from the last item listed "Use visual styles on windows and buttons" then click on Apply and OK. This will change the overall settings
 to Custom.<br />
<br />
However, there are some side affects of using this option which removes desktop icon shadows. It changes your Taskbar back to an XP style Taskbar and also changes any customized Icon, Menu and other Advanced appearance settings back to Default. Any settings
 that you had previously changed will have to be reaccomplished.<br />
<br />
When you open Internet Explorer it looks very similar in color etc that it did with XP which now is easier to read than Win 7 I feel. Each person will just have to play around with the Advanced appearance settings and select those they like best.<br />
<br />
So far I am delighted with the settings I now have and also not having the desktop icon shadows.
<br />

                    <p>I have a Surface Pro and I just ran the windows update (November 1st, 2017).&nbsp; Now every time I open a new Edge window or go back to a previous tab and it refreshes, the bottom half of the screen is white.&nbsp; If I open the keyboard an then immediately close
 the keyboard, the whole window is visible.&nbsp; This has become a big pain.&nbsp; Since windows has done everything possible to make Chrome and Firefox difficult to use on windows 10, I kind of need Edge to actually work somewhat efficiently.</p>

                    I use Windows 7. When I needed to burn an iso file, I used to use the built in iso burner, Windows Disk Image Burner. Now it's gone from my right click menu, and I have this weird entry that says "-exit -isowrite". What's going on? How do I get WDIB back?

            <div>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the system originally had another version of Windows did you run the Upgrade Advisor and<br />
check the Compatibility Center for the CD/DVD compatibilty (and other devices as needed).<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - please run this now.<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a>
<div>
<div>
<p><br />
Also check the Compatibility Center (for major devices)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Check with the System maker and the Device maker for information about drivers for Windows 7.<br />
(BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers).<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check these :</p>
<p>The DVD drive does not function after you install Windows 7 - these are different Sony drives<br />
however the same issue could be affecting your drive.<br />

<br />
FIX: The DVD drive is not recognized after you install Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2<br />

<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If the System can run Windows 7 AND there are drivers for the devices these might help :<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<p>I will want change Windows 10 from Professional to Home, reason is simple with Pro I get always error of any kind, with Home on other machine everything work greate. It more funny Home version was installed on "unsupported", old machine (nx7400) and work,
 with out problems, even performance is not bad,&nbsp; Pro on new Acer i3, 8Gb RAM, SSD had errors, I tired with fix problems every day, I lost money because that. I temportary try Home on it and work with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's simple, I want to change license from Pro to Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can fix every problem, i know how, but I don,t have time for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not buy other license I have one for Pro and one for Home. Faster I go to Ubuntu I checked to work greate than I want my money back for Pro version.</p>
<p>

            EDIT:
<p>Ok I fixed issues, main problem is bad detect SSD hard disk, fixed by uninstall drivers, now I can see proper device name. I can saw after delete ACER OEM tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next Garbage from OEM (ACER things) is pernamently delete all pseudo helpers, trackers etc..., not first time producent programs make system unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replace Defender with Comodo AV. Maybe not important.</p>
<p>Enable TRIM Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it help somebody, good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OLD MSG:</p>
<p>64 bit</p>
<p>1703 before 1607</p>
<p>15063.332 now</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I write before Home version no any error this always something, upgrade to 1703 fix some, but it's still some, last defender block update, self update. No problem fast fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fix any Win problem, I know every tool inside, but I dont have time for it. I do with OS what I want, any OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other Windows machines work good other one with Win10 no Pro, work some from first preview without any errors like this Pro. One 11 years old with home Win10 of course, with no that errors.</p>
<p>I have Mac, BSD, Ubuntu and ten more machines. but I have one Win 10 Pro. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly problems updates, developer tools (no on Home). Och files permissions maybe SSD, second replaced exacly same with home installed good, this on other machine same errors, but boot with home installation good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes most problems is from permissions I know that, but why than change, it should not, last after Mail update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simple tired, fix things every time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is not big bugs, little things but annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found to many post with Pro errors to believe that I wrong.</p>
<p>Without that I check log, etc.. For example yesterday Metro Apps stop work, i get AppsDiagnostic and what say no errors, yes i fix it easly but lost time some 2 houres (*.bat work time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want only go from Pro to Home, and yes I recovery, clean install, from ISO, same errors no other but still same.</p>
<p>I don't use any **** pseudo update tools, computer without any worm, only legal or OpenSource software, I don't carre if believe or not, that is it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or we need good tool for fix perms , automatic will by nice, manual I have MS give that free, but check all folders and file by hand crazy<br />

            All files stored in temp folders can be deleted without risk. I would create a scheduled task that runs at boot-up time and deletes everything in the nominated temp folders. I have been doing this on my machine for a long time and it works very well.

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; I've deleted them all. Would love to know WHY they are there. I just discovered the location to set environment variables and set all four TMP/TEMP to D:\Temp - this may solve a lot of problems I've been having with thousands of downloads filling
 up C, even if the D drive is slow.&nbsp; I created a scheduled batch file that ran Ccleaner and Cleanmgr.exe on startup "if missed". I don't boot and it's hard to get a task to run on wake, or to wake to run.
</p>
<p>Thanks again.&nbsp; Will consider this solved until next time..</p>

<div>&nbsp;Norm, it is unclear whether you are PULLING content from the computer using</div>
<div>menus on the TV or using Play To to push content from the computer TO the TV by</div>
<div>right clicking a file and selecting Play To/TV from the shortcut menu (if your</div>
<div>TV supports this). What model Panny? </div>

</p><p>The Panasonic model is TC-55VT60.&nbsp; In order to increase the quality of the sound a Vizio 5.1 soundbar has been added (Model 4251).&nbsp; The soundbar works fine if the CD is placed in my Blu-ray player,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the blog thread that you referenced&nbsp;(which I will study in more detail later today) I noticed that in the 7th slide down the WMP menu has a "play to" choice -- this choice does not appear on my PC.</p>

            <p>You may possibly want to try something like - <a href="http://www.serviio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.serviio.org/</a> (I <strong>haven't</strong> tried it, just read about it). It even has a Panasonic section on its forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Serviio works with many devices from your connected home (TV, Playstation 3, XBox 360, smart phones, tablets, etc.). It supports profiles for particular devices so that it can be tuned to maximise the device's potential and/or minimize lack of media
 format playback support (via transcoding)."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to confess I <strong>haven't</strong> used it as it requires Java and I don't have or want that installed. For the little bit of DLNA streaming I do ( Panasonic 2011 model DT30 ) it seems to work just about, by streaming directly for W7, usually!
 &nbsp;Had some issues setting it up though. But it seemed more trouble than it was worth and did not always function as well as I hoped. Now I just Plug the file directly into the TV via SD or USB and it always seems to work, or stream it from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As always, if you do try it, AV check the download before installing it.</p>

</p><p>Can't tell you just how much I appreciate your help on this issue!!&nbsp; Panasonic Technical Support had led me to believe that I was the only one encountering this problem and I was unable to get them to accept ownership of the complaint.&nbsp; The google search
 clearly shows that there are a lot of others in the same boat as I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is in the process of being "escalated".&nbsp; I am not sure what that means but hopefully I will hear back from them sometime next week.&nbsp; Their attitude is, at the very least, irritating and their refusal to accept responsibility frustrating!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not an inexpensive purchase and most reviews gave the TV very high marks but none addressed the DLNA situation -- needless to say I am very disappointed with Panasonic's tech support.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This pilgrim continues to be frustrated -- especially with Panasonic's Technical Support!&nbsp; The issue was "escalated" by the support group (I'm not sure exactly what that means) and the escalation response was to look at page 92 of their ehelp manual for
 my TV</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is extremely disappointing that Panasonic Technical&nbsp;Support&nbsp;refuses to take ownership of this problem -- especially in the light of the google thread posted by Barb.&nbsp; I would like to escalate the issue beyond Panasonics support group but do not know how.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions on how to do so are more than welcome.</p>

            <p>I never got far with Panasonic support either. Similar experience, they can point you to a few pages in a handbook, but don't usually seem to be able to go beyond that.</p>
<p>I think the problem is Panasonic sets just ain't that smart ( not that any of the sets are perfect ) and Panasonic sets are just limited in what they will play. I largely gave up in the end, having got fed up with fighting their DLNA, having found that putting
 the same struggling video onto a SD or USB card into the same set usually always played it ok without a fight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you could try that server mentioned above, as it seems to do "on the fly" conversions via preset profiles to apparently help with what the set can or cant play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I say, I've not tried it, gave up with the process and stuck with the few formats my set seemed to accept, or used the SD card instead. So may be worth reading up and investigating that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Didn't see you mention cache clearing but give the following a shot and let us know:</p>
<p><b><span>Clear System Cache:</span></b><span><br />
1) Scroll right and go to<span>&nbsp;the </span><b>Settings</b> tab, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>System Settings</b><br />
2) Select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Hard Drive</b><br />
3) Highlight Hard Drive, and press Y (Device Options)<br />
4) Select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Clear System Cache</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Yes<br />
</b></span>5) Repeat steps 2 thru 4 two more times so that your Cache is cleared 3 times</p>
<p><b><span>*NOTE* </span></b><span>The cache stores such items as game updates, system update installation packages, and gamer pictures of your friends. Clearing the Xbox 360 cache does not remove your Gamertag, content that you have downloaded, game files,
 or console software updates.</span></p>

</span>Hi - just finished a clean install of Windows 7 this afternoon ( upgrading from XP ). Running a homebuild system : Gigabyte GA-8PENXP Mobo, 2GB RAM, Core2Duo 6600, Nvidia 8800GTS Graphics. Install went cleanly no errors or hiccups. Problem is I can't
 install anything. Tried to download an install AVG and Avast AV products, both installers failed. iTunes installer just does nothing. However, I have successfully installed Office XP Pro and Stanza eBook reader. Turned off UAC - no difference. Ideas appreciated.
 It's driving me nuts

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to perform a System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt
 opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to
 continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find
 any integrity violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;Also try to run program as an administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To do this right click on a program which you are trying to install and click on “Run as an Administrator”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also try to run program in compatibility mode and also check whether that program which you are trying to
 install is compatible with Windows 7 or not.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check the link which talks about
<strong>How to run program in compatibility mode.</strong></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hola L1NK1N CHWYX,</p>
<p>Como se indica en las preguntas frecuentes de esta oferta, nos lleva hasta 96 horas recibir y procesar nuevas compras para completar una oferta. Como solo realizó sus compras hace dos días, es muy temprano para que podamos ver las compras de su juego.</p>
<p>Si las compras de su avatar se hicieron aún más recientemente, de manera similar, es demasiado pronto para ver esas compras también.</p>

</p><p>The scannow and dism commands were run successfully but it did not change the program check when running .appx files.</p>
<p>

<p>Well AppInstaller is useless.</p>

<p>btw, kudos to the PowerShell development team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly named "powershell".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a linux bigot, I prefer command mode. The fact that ps will take commands in BOTH windows and linux format is a huge plus to me (not to mention the HUGE # commands supported)</p>

    <title>Windows 7 crashing once a week at around 9am - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 crashing once a week at around 9am</h2>
                    <p>We have a client that uses his computer to trigger a door to open when someone scans a barcode outside. He needs 24hr uptime but his computer started crashing recently at the same time every week at around 9am. There is a dump file. Don't know what to do
 with it. But he is pretty upset that his members can't get into his facility when this happens. Captured some details below. Not many software applications on the computer. Just ours and spotify, and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a place to upload&nbsp;the dump file? Trying not to lose this customer. None of our other 563 clients have this problem.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Are all the client machines connected through a domain network?</p>
<p>b. Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>c. Do you get a blue screen when the system crashes?</p>
<p>d. Does it happen when you access some specific application? If so, name the application that you initiate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The causes of system crashes can vary greatly. However, most of these errors result from a corrupt or damaged version of a system .dll file, corrupt hardware drivers, or issues between Windows and other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
I would suggest you to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for system file corruption.
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong>All Programs</strong><span>&nbsp;and open&nbsp;</span><strong>Accessories</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt</strong><span>&nbsp;in the Program list and then select&nbsp;</span><strong>Run as administrator</strong><span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
</span><strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, if the Blue screens are frequently accompanied with the system crash, please refer to the following link:</p>

<em>Note:</em> Make sure that you back up the data before proceeding with check disk.</span></p>
