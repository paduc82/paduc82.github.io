<h2>            Sony Bravia KDL40XBR6 won&#39;t display 1920x1080 when used as a display</h2>
                    I am trying to connect my Sony Bravia KDL40XBR6 HDTV to my PC running XP.&nbsp;I am connecting VGA to VGA. It wont display 1920x1080 even though the on board chip set tells me it will support this resolution? the best i can do is 1280x1024.<br />
Sony told me&nbsp;that TV will only support the native resolution of the computer and that no additional display driver would work.<br />
Any idea on how to get my PC and Bravia to display 1920x1080?

<p>Try using the HDMI port on the TV.&nbsp; I have a Sharp Aquos that advertizes 1080i resolution but only using HDMI.&nbsp; The best resolution I could get with the VGA port was 1280x1024.&nbsp; If your PC has a DVI port, you can adapt DVI-HDMI (without sound)...VGA, not
 so much.</p>

            The problem ended up being with the graphics card on the PC. I have since tried this with a better graphics card on my new laptop and I'm able to obtain full 1080. Basically the graphics wouldn't pass full 1080 over VGA. Even though it should work, it
 didn't. Oh well. A newer NVIDIA HD card in the PC makes all the difference. <br />

            Only thing that sucks is when you have a Dell Inspiron with the shitty built in graphics card (attached to the motherboard) which I'm pretty sure you can't upgrade... best resolution I can get with the VGA is 1600X1200 and then use the wide 2 zoom.<br />
<br />
But yeah, pretty much bthe first thing you could try is just updating your current graphics driver, and if it has the newest driver version then you will either need to use and hdmi cord (if the graphics card hard the hdmi output) or go and buy a new graphics
 card with the hdmi output because I'm pretty sure the highest you can go with vga is around 1600X1200 (my dad is using 1360X768 on a 55inch Sony Bravia bcuz it's the highest his graphics card will allow). Funny thing is his works better bcuz it is the proper
 ratio (1.770...) so he can just zoom and everything still looks normal where as mine doesn't really work properly with any of the ratios I have to choose from (1.33..., 1.777..., 2.14...) and the 1.33... ratio is the highest I can use so I have to do a stupid
 stretch and everything looks blurry. =/ (so glad I have no issues just using the component/RGB cables for my 360, mmm Skyrim on 1080p)<br />
<br />
So if you are stuck in the same situation as both me and my dad(shitty graphics card with no hdmi port or no hdmi cable to use) just find the resolution that has the closest ratio and then use the appropriate zoom to get the closest to a proper fit. Furthermore
 to get the ratio number I was referring to you just divide the pixel width number (such as the 1600 I am using) by the pixel height number (the 1200 I am using) and there u go (1600/1200=1.33333) =D<br />
<br />
PS. If anyone knows if you can upgrade the graphics card on an Inspiron 545 with the crappy Intel(R) G33/G31 Express Chipset Family Adapter please let me know =p<br />

<p>Just as a suggestion, you could perhaps just set the sleep timer on the TV to switch off after a certain time. That way you can still set a time limit, but don't need to worry about doing it through the xbox, which I'm not sure is possible :)</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Not working. Or is it&#63;  error 0x80070490</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had a similar problem to others on this forum with Windows 8 not preforming regular updates. Initially I&nbsp;received the error code 0x80070490 and I ran the windows trouble-shooter which said it had fixed two issues - but I still received an error when
 trying to update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run the System Update Readiness Tool, which reported no corrupt files found. However, the updater now gives an impression of running but there is only 1 optional update that I had received early this month and tried to hide - (Bing Desktop v1.1).
</p>
<p>When I run Review Update History in Control Panel it tells me I have not downloaded any updates, which is utter nonsense as many updates were initially downloaded when I bought the computer in March 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to be able to find a URL address that will get me to a list of the latest Windows 8 updates so that I can see if the Updater is actually working.</p>
<p>The last updates the PC managed to install were on 10April 2013 are&nbsp;KB283351, KB2822241, KB2817183, KB2813170, KB2808735, KB2800033, KB2781197.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been unable to find a Microsoft web page that tells me what the latest updates are; I keep getting directed to using the Windows 8 Updater that I believe is still not working correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had nothing but problems with this operating system since I bought the PC and would rather go an buy another PC than to have to restore windows 8 after only 6weeks. Oh how I miss XP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please believe and have faith (as I do) that Windows 8 is a better o.s. than XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand that 1 of the fixes you ran have removed the "history" (the older history) of updates on this machine.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it would not change or affect any "installed updates".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What matters much more is the Installed updates.</p>
<p>Use Control Panel &gt;&gt;all control panel items &gt;&gt; Windows Update</p>
<p>and then select Installed updates at bottom left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>SD card freezes computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agnesgirl10  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD card freezes computer</h2>
                    I'm trying to transfer photos from my SDHC card to my computer, however, the card freezes up every computer I try to use. The card is recognized, but if I try to open the pictures (or right-click for menu), the computer freezes. I can access photos on
 other memory cards, but not this one. I'm using Windows 7, all the drivers are up to date, and there are no Windows Updates available.
<div>Any ideas on getting the pictures off?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Agnes,</p>
<p>A couple of things come to mind. First, can you access the card at all - can you left-click on the card and have the computer not freeze? Secondly, where have you been trying to right-click the card from, Windows Explorer? If Explorer, try doing it from
 My Computer...What happens? Third, you say the card is recognized. How do you know? Where is it showing up? Does its drive letter change? Does anything change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, can you access a Command Prompt? If so, try this command copy "full source&nbsp;filename path" "full destination filename path".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

                    <p>I have seen videos of the past versions of the XBOX&nbsp;Accessories application and it shows different stick curves for the analog sticks than what the app currently has. &nbsp;In fact, a version a year ago allowed you to make your own curve if you desired!</p><p><br /></p><p>I really want to make my own curve to the point of if I sneezed on my controller it would rail left or right.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggressive and instant setting are just not even close to enough. &nbsp;I am disappointed in this controller and the fact that it has gotten less customization over time. &nbsp;I really wish these features came back or I wish I could download the older versions of the software.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you're having issues with G27 Racing wheel while playing games on Windows 10, this can be due to an outdated driver of the device. Another reason is if there's an update available for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We also suggest checking if there are any updates available for the affected game as well as for your Windows 10 computer. Refer to the links below for the steps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for updates for apps and games from Windows Store</a><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the same instance occurs, kindly get in touch with the device manufacturer of&nbsp;G27 Racing wheel. They'll provide you further assistance on how to get the latest driver for the device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Keep us posted with the outcome. We'd be glad to offer additional help.<br />

<h2>            SurfaceBook2 Add Fast Storage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received a SurfaceBook2 256MB version for Christmas and that isn't close to enough space that I would use so I am wondering if there is a fast Read/Write solution to adding more space to the System?</p>
<p>Something portable I have seen the BaseQI but those speeds are to slow.</p>

<p>The fastest you will get are usb-3.1 gen.1 based speeds as this is a general limitation on SB2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get these with external SSD Harddisks, for example the Samsung portable (up to 2 TB) and similar ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For smaller solutions you could try USB flash drives with high specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try SDXC cards or microcards with uhs-ii specifications, albeit not in the built in card slot. You will need a uhs-ii capable usb-3 adapter. This is included with some Lexar and Samsung drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a good way to make use of the usb-c port on the SB-2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try a usb-c to GB Ethernet adapter (like the one from Microsoft) and ethernet based storage or even Wlan storage if you have a really fast router.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello Roger,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue persists on other mouse device as well, you may be facing the above issue due the missing or corrupted system files and folders on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the cause of the issue and in certain cases will fix to enhance the performance of the system.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to run the
<strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> by following the steps below and check if for any power components change status.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Run
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior. System freezes and other irregular behaviors is mostly caused due to the unwanted/unused files retained in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Maintenance</span></strong><span> troubleshooter will find and clean up unused files and shortcuts present on the system
 and perform maintenance tasks which will enhance the performance of the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>

<div><span>Hi,</span></div>
<div><span>Try the steps mentioned below to resolve the issue.</span></div>
<div><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></div>
<div><span>Check if the IP Helper service is started.<br />
<br />
IP Helper service provides tunnel connectivity using IPv6 transition technologies [6to4, ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol), Port Proxy, and Teredo], and IP-HTTPS. If this service is stopped, the computer will not have the enhanced connectivity
 benefits that these technologies offer.</span></div>
<div><span>1. Click on Start, type Services in the search box.</span></div>
<div><span>2. On the Services window, look for the IP helper service.</span></div>
<div><span>3. Make sure the service is started and set to Automatic.</span></div>
<div><span>If the service fails to start, check its dependency services first start them and then try to start the IP helper service.</span></div>
<div><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></div>
<div><span>If the issue still persists, update the Network card drivers. ISATAP and Teredo are interrelated to Network card drivers.</span></div>
<div><span>Update the drivers for your Network adapter from the Manufacturerâ€™s website.<br />

<h3> sealion1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1709 Build 16299.15</h2>
                    <p>My problem started after the <strong>Auto install for W10 1709 in early December 2017</strong>... I contacted MS (<strong>assure member</strong>) support citing that my desktop computer had slowed to a crawl when booting up &amp; searching the internet, it also
 seemed to affect my Outlook 2013 emails when they required to show internet content... A re-installation of my&nbsp;<strong>Office 2013 professional by the original disk appeared to fix this...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Over a period of&nbsp;<strong>about 10 days starting on the 9th Jan 2018</strong> &amp; after going through the
<strong>Level 1 &amp; 2 Techs (Philippines), </strong>who did a re-install on the <strong>
15th Jan 2018</strong> but couldn't find a problem, I also lost the ability to download &amp; update any
<strong>MS Security &amp; Quality updates, including 3rd party updates,</strong> the last successful updates being on the
<strong>15th Jan 2018</strong> prior to the Level 2 techs doing the re-install...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this<strong> Update KB4056892 refused to install each time it was tried &amp; kept reinstalling at every time We/I tried a restart...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this failure I was passed on to a <strong>Level 3 tech (India)</strong> &amp; for a total of some, approximately, 10 hours of "tinkering"
<strong>over a period of 8 days</strong> , the last being Yesterday, Saturday 27th Jan 2018...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Level 3 tech </strong>then told me that, because my motherboard, a
<strong>GIGABYTE GA - 78LMT - USB3 rev 4.1, (Installed new 4.5 years ago) </strong>
had not been updated by the&nbsp;<strong>Gigabyte manufacturer to run Windows 10 OS, </strong>
The updates only went to &amp; included Windows 8.1, so the driver could not be updated to accept the W10 OS??? (Checked the Gigabyte website)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to accept this information as I'm not an expert &amp; he is, <strong>But what I don't understand is,
</strong><strong>The</strong> <strong>AUTO updates have always been successful right from Windows 7 to the first W10 in 2015 &amp; if this "Motherboard" is not compatible how come I haven't had any problems until now with Version 1709, Build 16299.15... I have
 NEVER forced a download &amp; install of any W10 Version, always waiting for the AUTO install to occur so the ball has always been with MS to assess if my computer was suitable for update...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, as I sit here typing this <strong>"cry for help &amp; understanding"</strong>
<strong>I do not have the ability to update my W10 compute</strong>r &amp; I don't understand why, &amp; as a 75 year old pensioner, a little confused as, before I contacted MS (ASSURE) support, I had a slow, but fully functional computer (desktop) &amp; now I don't???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely MS would not shoot itself in the foot &amp; release a new program such as Windows 10 to customers who, possibly, could not install it because of a hardware supplier who would not update their product to accept it???&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Willem,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description, you are unable to connect to network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error message/code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What type of network is it? Is it a Home network?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to computer just before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the Network troubleshooter </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> <b>Temporarily disable security software and firewall settings and check if the Internet Connection drops.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disable Antivirus</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> Boot into<b> safe mode with networking</b> and check if youâ€™re able to connect to Network</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>If it works in safe mode, we can use Clean boot method to narrow down the root cause of the issue.</span></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>The network im trying to connect to is&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;as a home network by the wireless card, but not by the motherboards&nbsp;Ethernet.</div>
<div>The&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;picks it up as an&nbsp;unidentified&nbsp;network/ Public network.</div>
<div>I Followed all the instructions and there has been no difference.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The wired connection goes through a&nbsp;</div>
<span>TP-Link TL-PA211KIT&nbsp;</span><span>network adapter to the router</span>
<div>I managed to get it working for a while before the connection dropped and it hasn't been&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;since.</div>

Can you scan part of the document and join it up into one large document with sticky tape?&nbsp; Not very professional, I know.</p>

<p>You may have lost permissions on your user profile or the profile may be corrupt.&nbsp; Verify to make sure that you have Full Control on your "Documents and Settings\UserName" directory.&nbsp; If the profile is corrupt see here:<br />

            I checked under Documents and Settings and discovered that there is a new folder, Jen Bennett.JNOTEBOOK, as well as my Jen Bennett folder (which, thank God, has all my old files in it).&nbsp; Does this mean that my Jen Bennett folder became corrupt and Windows
 created the Jen Bennett.JNOTEBOOK folder?

<p>It could be corrupt or it could just be that you lost permissions on the folder, the folder renaming scheme is explained here:</p>
<p>How To Restore a User Profile in Windows Server 2003</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324734</a></p>
<p>If you are using XP Pro disable Simple File Sharing (Tools&gt;Folder Options&gt;View tab) and then right click on your profile folder and select Properties&gt;Security and make sure that you have Full Control on the folder and all its child objects.&nbsp; If you are using
 XP Home you have to log on to Safe Mode to access the Security Tab, or you can use the CACLS command at a command prompt to verify and grant yourself Full Control on the folder:</p>
<p>To verify your permissions:</p>
<p>cacls "C:\Documents and Settings\User Name"</p>
<p>You should have :F&nbsp; listed for your account, if you don't:</p>
<p><strong>cacls</strong> C:"\Documents and Settings\username" /t /e /g "user name":f</p>
<p>will grant you full control on the folder.&nbsp; You <strong>must</strong> use "quotation marks" (as above) when&nbsp; there are spaces in the path or in the user name.</p>
<p>If you do have full control on the folder then the profile is corrupt.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wireless Hosted Network is a wireless local access network feature supported on Windows&nbsp;7 that allows virtualization of a physical wireless adapter into more than one virtual wireless adapter sometimes referred to as Virtual Wi-Fi. There are different
 commands used to set the parameters that the Hosted Network will use when deployed. The option to hide a Hosted Network is currently not implemented. For us to resolve your concern, you can check the functions, features and the different commands that are
