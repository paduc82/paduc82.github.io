    <title>Computer only boots to System Recovery Options after 1 week - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yodajm900  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer only boots to System Recovery Options after 1 week</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 on my fathers computer about a week ago.&nbsp; I installed it as an upgrade to Windows Vista.&nbsp; For the week it was working fine until yesterday when my dad tried turning on the computer and it would no longer boot to Windows, but only
 to the System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />
In the System Recovery Options it searches for installed OS's and tries to automatically repair the system startup options.&nbsp; It finds 2 Windows Startup options: Windows 7 Ultimate (Recovered) and Windows Recovery Environment (Recovered).&nbsp; When I click Repair
 &amp; Restart, it says "Failed to save startup options".&nbsp; I then click OK and it has the Option to select an Operating System or restore a System Image.&nbsp; There are no OS's listed.&nbsp; The main HDD is IDE, so I don't know why its not seeing the OS.&nbsp; I can try and
 do the Startup Repair but it fails because there is no OS selected.<br />
<br />
I then plugged this HDD into another working computer.&nbsp; The hard drive has 3 partitions, the main Windows partition and the 2nd partition were unreadable in my working computer.&nbsp; The 3rd partition was readable just fine.&nbsp; So I was figuring the problem was with
 the hard drive.&nbsp; I tried Partition Table Doctor but it could not recover the partition tables for the first 2 partitions.&nbsp; So I ran a program to try and recover as many files as I could and saved them to an external hard drive.<br />
<br />
I put the troublesome hard drive back in my dads computer, did a clean Windows 7 install, formatting the 2 bad partitions.&nbsp; The installation proceeds fine and Windows eventually works fine again, but once I restart the computer after the first working session
 of Windows 7, it comes back only booting to the System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />
So I assumed the HDD was on its last legs.&nbsp; I took an extra hard drive I have, formatted it during the Windows install and installed Windows 7 on the extra hard drive.&nbsp; But after the installation and the first working session of Windows, the installation was
 no longer working in exactly the same manner, it would load the System Recovery Options.&nbsp; The System Recovery Options behaved in almost an identical manner as it did at the beginning of this post, trying to repair the startup options but failing to save the
 options.<br />
<br />
So I am now at a loss of what to do next.&nbsp; Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            I want to add one thing, I just tried using the repair from the Windows 7 DVD and this time the automatic system startup options repair was able to save the settings and Windows started up fine after the computer restarted.<br />
<br />
So now its back in Windows but I'm afraid this will happen again the next time I restart the computer.

            So I restarted and the same problem occurs, launching System Recovery Options and behaving in the same manner with the inability to save the recovered startup options.<br />
<br />
I can "fix" it by repairing via the Windows 7 disc, but this only lasts until I restart the computer.&nbsp; Once I restart the same problem happens again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what the root of the problem might be?

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; PC will not wake from sleep or shut down after update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 48 hours ago, between Jan. 31st and Feb. 1st, my desktop needed a refresh as it was experiencing lag and went into an auto-update. After said update my PC became unable to wake from sleep mode or enter shutdown from the browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When entering sleep it freezes on a black screen, the mouse and keyboard do not respond; the computer also hums loudly as though it is still in use.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In order to wake the PC up I needed to manually reboot/force shutdown via the power button.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I had contacted support via chat, but 2 agents were unable to resolve the issue. I had also tried some basic troubleshooting with help from online sources, however these did not provide a solution.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>=============================</p>
<ul>
<li>HP Pavilion All-in-One 27-a010t</li><li>Ver. 1709 (build 16299.214)</li><li>Prev. edition prior to update was another build of 1709 as of 12/04&nbsp;<em>(but the 9 items in update history run up until 02/02)&nbsp;</em></li><li>Windows 10 Home -- pre-installed</li></ul>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>Summary of events leading to error (between 1/31 and 2/2):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Computer began to lag while in use, so decided to restart.</p>
<p>2.) PC went into auto-update after restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) Device seemed functional and assumed auto-update completed normally.</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp;Computer went to sleep for the evening but was unable to wake the following morning.</p>
<p>5.) Rebooted several times and let it go back to sleep, computer still could not wake when set to sleep.</p>
<p>6.) Assumed that auto-update only partially completed after restart</p>
<p>5.) Manually and successfully updated via the control/settings panel</p>
<p>6.) Problem persisted, sought outsider assistance.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>Attempted Fixes/Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Device Manager&nbsp;<em>(NO errors)</em></p>
<p>2.) Toggled HID devices and set to wake computer&nbsp;<em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>3.) Performance settings toggled between recommended and high performance&nbsp;<em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>4.) Attempted to toggle "hybrid sleep" via cmd and advanced settings&nbsp;<em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>5.) Troubleshooting devices and programs&nbsp;<em>(NO errors)</em></p>
<p>6.) Troubleshooting power sends back a performance issue which fixes itself, however the troubleshooter occasionally sends back same issue. Problem with shutdown/wake still persists.</p>
<p>7.)&nbsp;Fast start-up has been disabled&nbsp;<em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>8)&nbsp;Ran cmd powercfg /energy and there were several errors and warnings. I am unsure of what information from it to paste or if it would be relevant</p>
<p>9.)&nbsp;Display driver updates and uninstall <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>10.)&nbsp;Check Health and Scan Health <em>(NO errors)</em></p>
<p>11.)&nbsp;SFC <em>(NO errors)</em></p>
<p>12.)&nbsp;Restore Health <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>13.)&nbsp;Updated chipset drivers <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>14.)&nbsp;System Restore <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>15.)&nbsp;Resetting BIOS <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p>16.)&nbsp;Repair upgrade <em>(did not resolve the problem)</em></p>
<p><em><br />
Edited 2/2&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Edited 2/3&nbsp;<br />
</em>I am now experiencing issues with restart, they occasionally fail. I am considering clean install, but after seeing as a few other hundred people are experiencing the same issue I hope a more solid repair comes soon as many of the suggested fixes are not
 currently working. Waiting for a call back from LV 2 support, hope they can help.<br />
<br />
<em>Edited 2/4</em></p>
<p>These recent suggestions can't even be accomplished and it makes me feel as though the information I provided went unread.<br />
<br />
I have done everything Andre has suggested; the troubleshooting has not restored my PC's ability to properly wake from sleep or shut down from desktop. Can someone else step in and provide a solution? I'd like to speak with an expert and not a community representative.</p>

<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a> 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: shutdown -s -t 0
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Does it shutdown? 
<br />
<br />You can also try performing a repair upgrade:

<p>Okay so basic stuff first before I work through this very-long post, thank you so much for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>HP Pavilion All-in-One - 27-a010t</li><li>Ver. 1709 (build 16299.214)</li><li>Prev. edition was another build of 1709 as of 12/04 <em>(but the 9 items in update history run up until 02/02)&nbsp;</em></li><li>Windows 10 Home</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There is no "batteries" under device manager, I am assuming this is because this computer is an all-in-one desktop which is powered by an adapter and cable.<br />
<br />
I will attempt the updates/uninstall suggestions and get back to you!<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
1.) Updates only needed for 1 driver, display -- No effect upon install and reboot.<br />
</p>
<p>2.) BIOS updates seem to pose some form of data-loss/bricking risk and seems very difficult to do, so I'm electing to ignore that option for now.<br />
<br />
3.) driver uninstall has not worked.<br />
<br />
4.) SFC scan had no errors.<br />
5.)&nbsp;<span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth no errors</span><br />
<br />
<span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth no errors</span><br />
<br />
<span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth no effect, computer still will not wake from sleep and will not shut down</span></p>

            This problem never occured on this device before. It did not appear until after the computer tried to auto-update.<br />
<br />
As many of these suggestions seem to correlate to a laptop or tower PC; which mine is not as it's a pre-fab all-in-one monitor; I'm all ears if anyone has any other suggestions as so far these have not worked and I don't feel address the issue.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

I am unsure how to do that. I have already specified that 1709 had been installed previously according to my update history, it was this most recent update/version of 1709 that seemingly caused the errors.

<p>There's no way I can create a physical backup for my PC as outlined in these suggestions. I don't have any means of making a disc copy so I don't believe that is a viable option.<br />
<br />
My computer is about 1.5 years old and came pre-installed with windows 10. <br />
<br />
Ver 1709 was running fine throughout January, it was the Feb. 2nd update that caused the issues I'm experiencing. I was attempting to see if I could do a rollback, but it seems I cannot.<br />
<br />
I am looking at the BIOS reset and performance upgrade instructions to try and see if those will help.<br />
<br />
<em>edit&nbsp;<br />
</em>resetting BIOS did not fix the issue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>attempted rollback/system restore did not fix the issue</p>
<p>repair upgrade did not fix the issue</p>

<p>Okay it has become clearer to me now that you don't understand at all what's happening here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an All-In-One HP pavilion PC, it's a monitor with no external components or tower. There is no disassembling I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have listed pertinent and detailed information regarding the issue, as well as updates to attempted fixes utilizing your suggestions, yet so far have not had any success with your troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback is seemingly irrelevant to the problems I have mentioned and/or are not compatible/viable options for my PC's make and model -- especially your most recent reply.</p>

<p>Your computer was originally manufactured in June of 2016. Which means, the actual factory loaded version of Windows 10 would be version 1511.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a reasonable suggestion to get the system back to a working state, get off Windows 10 1709 by installing an older release. Stop thinking your system must or need to have Windows 10 1709 or Windows 10 1703.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your system back to the factory operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to be reasonable and understand you can't make bootable media out of thin air. So please go and find a working computer running Windows 7 or later and make a bootable media on a empty 8 GB USB thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as a neighbor, a friend, a trusted family member or go to a library or somewhere safe with a working computer and go make a bootable copy of Windows 10 1511 on it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:<br />
<a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b</a><br />
<br />
Choose the following:<br />
<br />
- Windows Final<br />
- Windows 10, version 1511<br />
- Windows 10 Pro + Home<br />
- English<br />
- x64 (64 bit)<br />
<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator compatibility with Windows 10.</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my eMachines PC from Windows 7 to windows 10. I attempted running Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 on Windows 10 and the error message, "Access Denied- Please login with administrator privileges and try again" popped up. (The program
 had functioned with Windows 7.) I attempted to right-click and run the program as an administrator, but then the message pops up, "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC?" and i selected yes and nothing occurred.
 I have also tried tinkering with the compatibility settings and have gained no success. I have also tried many times uninstalling and reinstalling the program.. I am unsure what to do next. Help...?

            <p>Boot from your Windows 7 DVD.</p>
<p>When you are asked where to install, select "Drive options (advanced)" and delete the 350MB boot partition and the partition on which Windows 8 is installed. Then highlight the empty space as where to install and let the installer partition and format the
 space.</p>
<p>There will probably be a recovery partition. You could delete that, but I suggest you leave it in place.</p>

            <p>The first thing I recommend you do is backup your Windows 8 installation in case you decide to go back to it in the future:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, go to the manufacturers website and check if they have native Windows 7 drivers for that model computer. Some manufacturers do not provide native Windows 7 drivers.</p>

<p>I tried booting from the Win7 CD. It stops at the "Installing Windows" screen (with the logo) and after more than an hour it still hadn't gone beyond that point. I don't remember it taking that long when I installed Win7 on my old machine; is that amount
 of delay normal?</p>

    <title>Sometimes monitor does not wake up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rschmitty20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sometimes monitor does not wake up</h2>
                    Hello, sometimes my computer will not wake from sleep, Win 7x64, latest nvidia drivers.&nbsp; This doesnt happen often, but when it does, the monitors never turn on.&nbsp; The light on my computer goes from flashing (sleep mode) to solid (power mode) however no
 mouse or keyboard actions will wake the monitors.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it is the monitors not waking or the computer itself semi-frozen<br />
<br />
I have a Belkin n52 gamepad that normally has a blue light when the computer is on.&nbsp; When I'm in the frozen state this blue light is not lit and pressing buttons on the gamepad lights up all lights (blue yellow red) so it has power but leads me to believe it
 is not communicating properly<br />
<br />
It is also very hard to diagnose as I can sleep/wake the computer many times in a row and see no lockups<br />
<br />
Nothing sticks out to me in the event log, is there anything I could be looking for or enable better logging to pinpoint the failing component/software/?<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>I would suggest you to verify if Mice and other pointing devices are allowed to wake the computer.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>To perform the same follow the steps mentioned below.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on <strong>
<span>start</span></strong>.<br />
b. Now type <strong><span>devmgmt.msc </span>
</strong>in the search files and programs field.<br />
c. At the <strong><span>device manager </span>
</strong>screen, <strong><span>right click
</span></strong>on the <strong><span>Mice and other pointing devices.</span></strong><b><br />
</b>d. Select <strong><span>properties</span></strong>.<br />
e. Now you have to click on <strong><span>power management tab</span></strong>.<br />
f. Now <strong><span>check mark Allow this device to wake the computer</span></strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>Also update your video card, if you all ready have the latest drivers, uninstall and reinstall them, as drivers can quite easily become corrupted.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Here are the steps to uninstall the display drivers from Device Manager:<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a) <strong><span>Open
</span></strong>Device Manager by clicking the <strong><span>Start button</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>System and Maintenance</span></strong>, and then clicking
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.<br />
b) If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
c) On the <strong><span>Device Manager </span>
</strong>window, look for the <strong><span>Display adapter
</span></strong>and let us know if you see any yellow exclamation mark in front of the Device.<br />
d) <strong><span>Right click </span></strong>on the
<strong><span>Device </span></strong>and select
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.<br />
e) <strong><span>Re-install </span></strong>the
<strong><span>latest Display drivers </span>
</strong>from the <strong><span>Manufacturers website</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Access the link below to know about how to get into Device Manager:</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2d8d5582-c5bc-4395-945f-5c6a273c5afa1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2d8d5582-c5bc-4395-945f-5c6a273c5afa1033.mspx</a><br />

                    <p>Today while I was playing Black Ops 3, a person with the Gamertag: Ect messaged me asking why I&nbsp;use the&nbsp;gun I was using and provoked&nbsp;me to try and get a reaction, as stupid as I was I gave him a reaction and said "s t f u", he then asked me what that meant so I told him. I then got a message from him saying "Banned" with a smiley face. I did not deserve this 24 hour ban. He provoked and provoked me until I gave him what he wanted so he could ban me, this is not how people who have this power should use it. He is overusing what he has to negatively effect myself and many others when I was just playing the game by myself causing no trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Update not working after clean install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am running Windows XP with IE6 on an older notebook computer.&nbsp; I did a clean install/recovery(?), then went to the Windows Update page where I clicked on the "GO" icon which I think activated the ActiveX program.&nbsp; Then, I clicked to check updates and the
 progress bar runs continually for hours without satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I else I should be doing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Bonita,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any anti-virus program installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so&nbsp;I would suggest you to disable and then try installing Windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Do not forget to enable the Anti-virus after you are done troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also run the FIXIT and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SP3 comes with the fresh install, fyi.</p>
<p>Error message when I run fix it....says I need net 2.0 so i click the link which says it's been upgraded to 3.1 but i get an error message when I try to download that. There's a message on that page that says I need Windows Installer 3.1 first, so I do that
 but get an error message.</p>

            <p>Do you have any other suggestions? AT this point the microsoft notebook is useless.&nbsp; The solutions you suggest above cannot be read on the notebook due to IE6 compatibility issues I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ActiveX has been installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All FixIts give me errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on Update the progress bar just runs continuously, for more than an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I downloaded the .net 2.0 so that I could attempt to install the Windows Installer 3.1, but I got an error message there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I should add that I did not do the more sophisticated instructions outlined in the bottom two links. Taht will be my last attempt.</p>

<p>I believe that the fix for this is to install IE8 (it worked for me recently). This will also get around the fact that this website does not work with IE6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get the standalone installer for IE8 here...</p>

            <p>Tricky is right but I also installed&nbsp;net framework 4.0 too and immediately got offered updates and the CPU Spikes resolved itself..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Odd thing though, the issue of being stuck in the searching or scanning for updates after manually starting the update search&nbsp;remained. The remaining updates were already downloaded and installed when I awoke in the morning.</p>

            <p>What you are experiencing is an issue where the svchost.exe spikes the CPU reading to 100% and stays there or fluctuates&nbsp; 1-2% either way. To confirm this, launch task manager, when it is happening and set to "show processes for all users", that way you
 know exactly which process is the culprit or even if that is the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You may have to set&nbsp; the columns at the top of the page to show whatever readings you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now here's what I did (not asking you do the same)to counter one process hogging all the CPU time. I identified which process it was, and simply ended it. A warning message popped up, but I went ahead and right after that, the download continued to success&nbsp;.
 Same thing during installation, same response, same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to try the above, but solely at your own risk and like I said in my previous post, I also went directly to .Net framework 4.0 and experienced the same issue, took the same course of action and as a result, my XP SP3 fresh install is fully patched.</p>

<p>The first thing you should do is to install the DirectX9 updates from this site-</p>

<p>Some utilities still need to have DX9 installed.</p>

<p>Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how the Skype number works. I have purchased Skype Numbers in the past. I do have Skype Credit. The Skype number is now forwarding to my cell phone. I have disabled call forwarding since the device that i want to receive calls on in wifi areas
 is an android phone that i use in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing is is that i have Skype on a iphone, an ipad and an android phone. When i log with the same log in info my account shows that i purchased a Skype number on my iphone but not the ipad or the android phone. The accounts sections even show
 different purchase histories and available credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Assign Com Port in device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macjd527  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assign Com Port in device manager</h2>
                    I have windows 7 and I need to change a com port for a device that connects to a terminal of ours. When the device was plugged into the pc it was assigned to port3 although the program we have that allows the pc to communicate with a terminal must communicate
 through port1.<br />
<br />
So my question is how do I change the usb adapter to communicate through port1 instead of port 3. In windows xp this could be done easily by going to the device manager and in the (Com&amp;Ltp) section you could find the device and change the port number it communicated
 through, Although with windows 7 the (Com&amp;Lpt) section is not listed in the device manager.<br />
<br />
All i need to do is change the com port from port3 to port1, any help is appreciated thanks.<br />

    <title>VMware Tools on Win 10 Stops after some time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krishalive  say:</h3>
<h2>            VMware Tools on Win 10 Stops after some time</h2>
                    <p>I have a Win 10 Enterprise installed on a VM with the latest VMware Tools installed (v10.2). I noticed that after some time, even though the VM is still powered on, the VMware Tools service stops, thus preventing me to access the services that use VMware
 Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen in any server OS (tested on Server 2012 R2 and Server 2016) or on Windows 8.1 and below. This seems to be unique to Windows 10. Can anyone please throw some light on why this is so? Is this a "new feature" of Windows 10?</p>

            Also not that that can happen with region locked games. If your account region and your physical location do not match, that can happen. With region locked games, your account region has to match your physical location and you have to be in a region where
 the games are available.

<p>Hi, this is my first post in this forum, I am going to purchase an xbox one soon. I just wanted to know that i live in a country with electricity crises that means that the electricity is shut down for an hour every 2-3 hours. So if i get a game on downloading,
 and it reaches 20%, then the electricity goes off, that means that the xbox is forced shut down as if i had plugged the main switch out of the socket. Then i turn on again, will the download continue from 20% or it will start again. If it will start from the
 beginning, then please tell me a way because this way I'll never be able to download games.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Through xbox live you will be able to continue to download the game even with interruptions. The downloading picks up again from the point where it was interrupted. I would suggest you to make sure you close the console before the electricity goes off or
 there are sudden overcharges. This way your console will live longer. &nbsp; </p>

<h2>            System process starts to run at constant 20&#37; after using my laptop for around 30 mins</h2>
                    <p>This is driving me nuts, my laptop (Huawei Matebook X Pro) starts to heat up and fans become louder after around 30-40 mins of usage. when I check the task manager I find that the "System" Process is using a constant 20% CPU time. after this I still can
 use the machine except that a number of things stops responding, I cannot eject external drives, I cannot restart and I have to shutdown the machine using the power button (hard reset). I have done some investigation and using the Windows Performance Recorder
 and Analysis tool, I found that this is cause by a driver called Microsoft.Bluetooth.Legacy.LEEnumerator as show in the screen shot</p>

</p><p>Can anyone help me please I don't know what to do to fix this. I am running Windows 10 - 1809, x64</p>

            Could you be hacked? Your computer might be mining bitcoin or cracking passwords for a botnet. Both will work your CPU very hard and cause excessive heat, which will cause problems for everything else inside the computer case. Your antivirus won't detect
 this, because the activities being performed are legitimate.

<p>Hi, Thanks for you reply.</p>
<p>I honestly do not think it's a hardware issue, since this is a brand new machine and it passes all hardware tests that I have made (memory, drives, etc.) and I think there is a pastern here since for some reason this issue does not happen some times even
 when under the heaviest of loads. However, I noticed that it does happen when I connect an external USB hard drive and my external DAC as well this accelerates the rate of the issue happening.</p>
<p>I am disabling all loaded software and drivers one by one and will try clean boot as well and see what I can find.</p>

            Thanks for the advice, I will check again and will restore from a know state but I don;t think this is a hack since I am usually very security conscious and have all my security apps up to date and running all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
