<h2>            &#34;network adapter&#34; issue in relation to password protected master video</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have problem playing a password protected lecture videos which should be able to run on window media player application. It keeps showing "please enable a network adapter". I have checked and the network adapters are enabled already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Step 1 &amp; Step 2 as suggested via <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-windvd/issues-with-password-protect-video-master-player/b30c3e1f-5c53-437e-8a8d-e3699772d149?tab=question&amp;status=AllReplies#tabs.">

<p>Unfortunately it does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I have tried playing on window 7 and it worked. Different from windows 10 because when I click &amp; open the password protected video file, the message which includes a machine ID does not appear and so it's not possible to get the password and
 play it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please help me with regards to the network adapter issue.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Vanishing Seagate Backup Plus 2T external hard drive in windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have a brand new Lenovo M93P minitower running windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have a seagate backup plus 2T external hard drive connected to the computer but several times each day the drive will disappear and no longer be recognized by Windows 8.1 (error 43).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate
 replaced the drive but the same thing is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate says windows 8.1 is the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenovo could not help.&nbsp; Can Microsoft?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be powering off as a power saving feature and windows detects that as an issue for some reason...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try tinkering with your USB settings in Power Options and the Seagate's settings in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2TB Expansion and have noticed that even though it is powered on, it doesn't actually turn on until you plug it in to the computer....</p>
<p>If it gets powered off, it may not reconnect.... Mine doesn't have this problem, but it could vary between machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might actually be part of a Seagate feature that is causing the problem... It seems to me that they have some type of power saving feature built into the enclosure... I know little about it other than the fact I have read about it's existence...</p>

            Thanks, but Seagate tech had taken me through all of the changes to the settings in power options already (both in the Seagate "Dashboard" and Windows 8.1 power settings), setting sleep to "never" etc. and nothing helped so they replaced the drive, but
 it did not help.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

 and then reconnecting both. Then after a few hours the drive would no longer be recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be a VERY common issue. I downloaded Seagate Dashboard Agent and made sure the drive was set to Never Sleep. That didn't help. I also tried different cables, switching to USB 2.0, and trying a different computer (also WIndows 8.1). Nothing
 would stop the drive from "going to sleep" during periods of inactivity. I finally resorted to a workaround that has eliminated the problem unti Seagate realizes that this is indeed widespread. Look for a freeware program called KeepAliveHD. I have no affiliation
 with the company or person who wrote this program but it appears to be clean and free of viruses and malware. It simply writes a very small text file to the drive every few minutes, thereby keeping the drive from going to sleep due to inactivity. You can specify
 the write interval. (Every 15 minutes worked for me.) I've been using this "fix" for several weeks and the drive has not gone to sleep during that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't know whether the problem lies with the Seagate Drive (firmware or software) or with the Windows 8,1 driver for the USB &nbsp;3.0 drive (apparently a generic driver provided by Microsoft). With this annoying problem at least temporarily fixed, the
 drive has performed very well for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am certain that there is a feature in the firmware of the drive that may be part of the problem....</p>
<p>The feature even has a name, but I've been unable to find it...</p>

</p><p>Here is another possible fix.</p>

<h2>            Explorer.exe keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows 10 and everything was working fine last night but since this morning, when i booted windows, the screen keeps flickering. The only thing that changed was a windows update which was flickering and looping between "Hi" "This might take several
 minutes.". I'm pretty sure even that was because of explorer restarting.<br />
</p>
<p>I checked around and found that the explorer.exe keeps restarting. All my settings are reset and all fonts are changed. Even in chrome i'm logged out of everything and if i sign back in, it resets on restart. I tried creating new user account but that says
 error with "Explorer.exe class not registered".<br />
<br />
I have already run sfc and dism and they found no issues.<br />
I went through several related forums but even those didn't work.<br />
<br />
The taskbar keeps flickering and the desktop is blank. I cannot right click anywhere and taskbar is unresponsive. If i try opening settings, it says "ms-settings install failed". The start menu isn't working even in safe mode.<br />
Already ran "<strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">" but even that didn't work.</span><br />
<br />
I can still use the system but i have to terminate the explorer and run everything from task manager's run as even windows shortcuts aren't working.</p>

            Windows 10 doesn't need a reason to be corrupted. Every day we deal with countless cases here of bugs and corruption in Windows 10, just trying our best as volunteers to keep users afloat.<br /><br />If the new account is not suffering the problem then there is no reason why you need to reinstall or repair the install because the issue has been isolated to a corrupted account. Again this is something we see here everyday. This is not Windows 7 where it rarely happened at all.

    <title>Remapping keyboard keys in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remapping keyboard keys in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help me with remapping the Insert key to Home key and vice-versa in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried editing the registry using the following,&amp; rebooting the computer, but it does not seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">00000000 00000000 03 000000 47005200 52004700 00000000</span></p>
<p>I have a 102-key keyboard (Dell Inspiron 15 3537) and the Insert and Home keys are independent (ie. do not coincide with numeric 0 or 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Help is much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ankita</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank again. I might be able to do this if needed, but it will not help, will it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mapping of the Insert key would still be Insert, just with the Home physical button over it? I am looking to change the windows mapping for the key - the mis-matched physical buttons does not bother me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I thought the registry edit would work, perhaps i have my hex codes wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much</p>

            <p>Sorry I don't know anything about keyboard mapping other than over the years bad laptop keys&nbsp;has proven to me &nbsp;it can be complicated.&nbsp; But not overly so.</p>
<p>

<p>Things that SharpKeys <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>will not</em></span> do:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow you to swap two keys with each other - e.g. you can’t have Q and Z swap places because the remapping code would get confused&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&nbsp; need to be a little
 creative.</p>

<p>Having a similar version of the same problem, but this request is somewhat reversed from everyone else's.&nbsp; For example, most computers I've seen (including the one used to type this message) have the F2 key in Excel open the highlighted cell by pressing
 F2, but the laptop requires FN + F2 because plain F2 dims the screen.&nbsp; Is there a Windows setting (or other option) that can change the use of the F1-F12 keys to use/not-use the FN (function) key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really just trying to remap one key, but remove/reverse an existing key macro that is backwards from normal.&nbsp; Since it's backwards from the norm, there should be an easier way to go back. Also, I use Office all the time, so being able to use the
 F1-F12 hotheys would be nice to do Without having to use the FN key also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for 3rd-party software, but between the mixed-success results and the fact that some don't show the F1-F12 keys at all (like the Layout Creator above,) I'm challenged to find a solution.&nbsp; Since HP was able to change the keybindings from the
 default setup (and since the change would be Back To the default,) there should be an easy way to reset them to Microsoft's default.</p>

<h2>            The person that bought this Xbox needs to sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’ve been playing Xbox regularly for the past couple of weeks and all of a sudden today it keeps saying “the person that owns this game needs to sign in” however I’ve bought ALL of my games digital. I have no disks, I have tried signing out and back in. I have tried hard resetting Xbox. And I have tried deleting and reinstalling, none of these things were helpful. Does anyone have any idea why this is happening ? Also, my Xbox is set to my home Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

 a xim I want to use the Razer Turret For Xbox One. Plus I want the Razer Turret For Xbox One to become available for Australia on the Microsft Store.</p>

<p>After installing the sp1 update for windows 7 64 bit I can no longer put my pc in sleep mode or let it go into stand by mode as a blue screen&nbsp; occurs with a&nbsp;power management error. After uninstalling the update everything works fine. So not sure if it's
 just a bug with the sp1 update or something on my end. So I am wondering if anyone else is having the same problem.</p>

<br />
I can duplicate this problem after install SP1 &amp; removing Windows7 X64 Service Pack 1 does get rid of the "sleep" related BSOD. When I reinstall SP1 the sleep related BSOD returns.

            I'm having the same issue described by the op. Everything worked fine before SP1 but after installing, I've been getting a BSOD with "INTERNAL_POWER_ERROR" every time I select Sleep Mode. I did not change any Windows or BIOS settings and it worked before
 so I figure it has to be an issue with SP1 but I'm not 100% sure what the SCSI miniport driver is. Is it relevant if my hard disk runs via SATA 6.0 GB/s?

<p>Open 'Device Manager' and look for a SCSI miniport driver entry.</p>
<p>Most SATA 6GBs drives have their own chipset (exception H67 and P67 boards) and device driver. You may need to reinstall the driver.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete windows.old folder with Explorer or Disk Cleanup</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I'm trying to delete my windows.old folder from my system drive and I tried following http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-remove-the-Windows-old-folder but Disk Cleanup doesn't show "Previous Windows installation(s)" as an option to delete.<br />
<br />
Explorer won't let me delete the files either. It keeps prompting saying that I must have Admin permissions even though I'm logged on as a user who is a member of the Admin group! I've tried taking ownership of the folder with no luck either.<br />
<br />
How do I delete this folder?

Try booting into Safe mode and deleting it.

<h2>            Shadow Fight 2 Won&#39;t Install because of the system requirements</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have an pc with these system specs. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce 7025 / NVIDIA nForce 630a</li><li>AMD Athlon Dual Core Processor 4050e 2.25 GHz</li><li>Windows 8.1 Pro</li><li>2 GB DDR2 Memory RAM &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I Went to Windows Store and i want to install this Game "Shadow Fight 2 for Windows" and it came up with an Purchase error "Sorry, this app can't be installed because this PC might not meet some of the requirements. Go to the app's description page to check
 for any of the requirements listed under Details." I go to the details and this game needs only x86,x64, ARM CPU and internet connection, have both of these as you see at my system specs, i contacted the publisher of this game and they said that is a problem
 of the windows store and contact them to check for any solution, the same thing happened with GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience that has the same requirements as Asphalt 8 that i installed so what is the problem that i cant install this game "Shadow Fight
 2 for Windows".</p>
<p>Plz Help.<br />

</p><p>It is now april 2016 , i just bought a bluetooth stylus (adonit jot script) for 50 euro's and I have a tablet with the latest OS of Microsoft. windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is no app that goes with both of them. Can you believe this???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand. The stylus mentioned, works on iOS. but not on windows 10 in a decent app. Writing in Onenote is terrible, you cannot rest your palm on the screen as it will write. no pressure sensitivity. And the writing is bad, cannot read my own writing!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some developper or microsoft need to step up and take this challenge. &nbsp;Cause this is sad. I have the best and newest of both worlds, but there is now decent app that can make them work. What a bad joke it is. We don't live in 2016. we went back some 500
 years. back to pen and paper. much cheaper. I want my money back.</p>

                    I just bought a new ThinkPad with Windows 7.&nbsp; My prior laptop ran XP, my husband currently runs Windows 7. When trying to install our wireless printer, it "sees" the printer but then it says it cannot locate a suitable print driver.&nbsp; I'm computer illiterate.&nbsp;
 I have no idea what to do to fix it.&nbsp; I need really basic info.&nbsp; This printer is a Lexmark 5500.My husbands Dell can "see" and connect to our printer, and I cannot.&nbsp; I could with my old Thinkpad with Windows 98, but I cannot now.&nbsp;

    <title>Internal &#38; External USB DAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcoop8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal &#38; External USB DAC</h2>
                    Hello! I have a Fiio Alpen 2 that I am trying to use as a USB DAC&amp;amp. I can pass music from the usb port through the DAC&amp;amp and hear it. The only issue I am having is that the Windows volume controls still control the music volume as if my headphones
 are plugged directly into my computer. To me, this would only happen if my computer's internal DAC is still being used before the music goes to my external USB DAC. Does anyone know how to tell if the signal is still going through my computer's internal DAC
 before going to the external DAC? If so, how can I make it so my computer skips its internal DAC and only uses the external DAC? Thanks!

            <p>The volume control doesn't mean the signal is going through the internal DAC. The system does the adjustment of level at the digital level so it's as lossless as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want what's called "bit-perfect" mode, you need to use an application that supports it. I use foobar2000. Strange name but it does do bit-perfect mode, I'm not sure if there are others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to use it, be careful to make sure the volume on the DAC/DAC-amp is set low because you will now have the full signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really like your music this mode makes a big difference.</p>

<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            <p>That wouldn't change anything.</p><p>&nbsp;The only way a xbox 360 would play games from both regions is if it was modded in some way.</p><p>There are a few region free games for the xbox 360 but apart from that a PAL console will only play PAL games,it will not play NTSC games,even if you change the consoles region.It's down to the software in the console.</p>
