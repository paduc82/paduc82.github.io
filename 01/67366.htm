            I managed to fix my problem in a different way as per Kevin Hau's solution, I used a USB to install Windows 7 as the disc was basically too worn, its a brand new in the box disc too.

            Here's another step I would like to try.&nbsp; Some people have reported that there's an update for ATAPI driver that might need to be installed.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>I checked on Windows Update Catalog for the

<br />
<span>You may&nbsp;have to install the ActiveX, then hit the link again to get the search results or just search on "ata atapi".<br />
<br />
Once you ge tthe results, we need to sort them by "Last Updated" to get the most recent version.&nbsp; Click the "Last Updated" column header to sort the list.</span></span></span></p>

click "Add"&nbsp;to add it to your download basket, then in the top right click "View Basket"&nbsp; Just below "View Basket" click Download and specify a folder to save it to, I suggest DESKTOP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Click Continue, then click Close.&nbsp; You should have the following Folder on your desktop:<br />
<br />
ITE Tech. Inc. - Storage - ITE IT8211 ATA ATAPI Controller<br />
<br />
Inside that folder is a single CAB file, which is just like a ZIP file or a RAR file, it's compressed.<br />
<br />
Open the CAB file and extract the contents to a USB drive, then try inserting the USB drive when you receive the CD/DVD driver error.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this solution, but I thought I would see if it helps anybody as per RJCE Support's post above.<br />
<br />
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS HELPS!!&nbsp; IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU REPLY IF IT WORKS!!!<br />

                    <p>Hello, my name is Kyle.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My laptop had just been stolen last week (17 July 2017)</strong>. I was so happy that I managed to track my laptop location after 2 days which was located 70km from my place by using the
<em>'Find My Device</em>' function. However, I did not able to know the exact location as the map just display a search radius which make it hard for me because the radius cover the whole district.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current problem is that when I try to track my laptop again the next day, the
<em>'Find My Device'</em> <strong>hyperlink had gone missing</strong>. I am so confused because my device status state that the
<em>'Find My Device'</em> <strong>function is on/enabled.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Does the thief somehow disable the function? If so, then why it is stated that the function is on/enabled? Is there anything wrong with my Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can anyone help me? Please? I am so sad as this is my last and only hope to find my laptop.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your device only sends its location if it has enough battery power, if it's connected to a Wi-Fi connection, and if it uses GPS. It is probable that your laptop has run out of power, or it's not currently connected to a Wi-Fi. Once your device is turned
 on, and gets connected to a Wi-Fi connection, you'll be able to use the <strong>
Find my device</strong> feature again. Remember to use the Microsoft Account that you registered as the administrator account of your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance with your concern.</p>

<p>I too really liked being able to 'free arrange' my files and folders in a way that suited me<em>.
</em>Leaving spaces between folders, and</p>
<p>grouping things in ways that make sense to <em>me</em>.</p>
<p><br />
The ability to do this was taken away from us with Win7, and replaced with 100 or more options to auto-arrange, so I can't see how</p>
<p>saving&nbsp; 'free' arrangements using more memory, or creating too many registry keys would be more of an issue than using
</p>
<p>these auto-arrange options.</p>
<p>Particularly as 8-16GB RAM is common these days. In the day of XP&nbsp; 2GB was considered a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same excuse was used with Win7 and is still does not stand up. Performance with heaps of free arranged folders on my Win7
</p>
<p>is as good as it is on Win10 without having that option.</p>
<p>- Too say that removing the option to disable Auto-arrange is for the benefit of the masses is nonsense. It has no effect on users who don't want it. Disabling Auto-arrange was done as a user preference. Auto-arrange was on by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Win7&nbsp; the fixes that made it possible to do 'free arrange' worked pretty well, excepting that you could place
</p>
<p>a file/folder on top of another and effectively hide the bottom folder (don't recall if this happened with XP).
</p>
<p>I occasionally had to hover the cursor over several folders to find the missing one (this highlighted the bottom folder).
</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>- However with Win10 the dictators as MS HQ have made any user intervention impossible. The Desktop is the only place 'free arrange' is available on Win10. If MS would at least make th e ability to disable auto-arrange in the User folders I would be happy
 as apig in mud. It can be done. They just don't want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You can still hack Windows to allow 'free arrange' but once you close the Window your personal setup reverts to default.</span></p>
<p>I hated the loss of the option to disable Auto-arrange, and now that Win10 has made doing so impossible this is a primary reason</p>
<p>(there is a lot I don't like about the Win10 UI) I keep threatening (to myself) to go back to Win7.</p>
<p>I do have Win7 installed as dual boot to cover some other issues, but still haven't bothered returning full time. The main reason I don't</p>
<p>is I will have to go with Win10 at some point anyway, so I may as well poke my eyes out now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were numerous threads on this topic when Win7 was released, especially in the first year. People with large photo collections,</p>
<p>including professionals, are the ones who suffered most. One thread got up to 100 or more pages before it got shut down.
</p>
<p>The Grand Poobah's at the MS Ivory Tower didn't care then, and they care even less now, particularly as they press 'forward'</p>
<p>with the even more reviled new business model of shoving version/features updated down our throats twice a year.</p>
<p>- Want to stop bloat ? Allow users to reject the version/feature updates which are largely bloatware and 'features' that MS include</p>
<p>to make more money ( A Shop built into an OS, which cannot be removed is a necessary 'feature' ? )</p>

<h2>            Unable to uninstall a program through Programs and Features</h2>
                    <p>I have had an issue with an excessive amount of pop ups lately in my chrome browser and found some sketchy programs installed on my personal laptop. I attempted to uninstall the malware through Programs and Features but when I hit uninstall or remove nothing
 happens and the program does not uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebooting and then uninstalling again through programs and features but had the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to uninstall programs on windows 8 or does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

    <title>BSOD after MSI motherboard update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redlineevrytime  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after MSI motherboard update</h2>
                    <p>When I updated my BIOS for my motherboard it originally wouldn't post.&nbsp; After clearing the CMOS, i could then only get it to post after removing one of the RAM sticks.&nbsp; It immediately sent me to the BIOS where I confirmed the stock settings.&nbsp; Windows could
 boot.&nbsp; For experimentation sake I could do it with the other RAM stick as well.&nbsp; To get the board to post with both RAM sticks, I had to enable A-XMP settings in the BIOS and once i rebooted with the additional RAM stick it would sent me to the BIOS to confirm
 settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything ran great until the system decided to start crashing.&nbsp; I would have to start all over again to get Windows to boot.&nbsp; One sick, Bios, Windows, restart, BIOS, Windows, shut down, two sticks, BIOS, Windows, crash.&nbsp; Now its gotten to the point where
 it crashes with just one stick.&nbsp; I have two minidump files in the Minidump folder.&nbsp; I feel that I should have more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help figuring out what is causing my BSOD.&nbsp; I can't reflash the mother board with the old BIOS.&nbsp; I tried, it won't let me.&nbsp; I'm thinking it's drivers, but I don't know how to go about replacing them.&nbsp; I check all my drivers once every few weeks to
 see if they are up to date.&nbsp; Like each driver.&nbsp; Every now and then I catch one that Windows update doesn't get.&nbsp; I am currently in safe mode on my PC.&nbsp; Thankfully my laptop hasn't had the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I share my minidump files and convince one of you geniuses to lend a helping hand?&nbsp; I have copied the minidump folder into my One Drive.&nbsp; Do i just right click and select "share a One Drive link"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I install the manufacturers drivers?&nbsp; MSI has told me to reflash my motherboard with the older BIOS, but like I said, that can't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

            Hi RE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, right click the unzipped Crash File and Share a Onedrive link to copy back to here. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also run Crucial Scanner to make sure the RAM is spec'd precisely:  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a>
<br />
<br />Check for Updates to make sure all are expedited, including restarts, until no more are offered.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Like I said.&nbsp; There are only two but the thing has crashed a dozen times.&nbsp; I checked to make sure my system was making dump files.&nbsp; Windows 10 is set to automatic memory dump.&nbsp; According to the BSOD Wiki that is what it is supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded all the drivers onto a USB and have attempted to install them, but my desktop is in safe mode and won't boot normally.&nbsp; Windows says that Windows installer cannot be used while in Safe Mode.&nbsp; All the drivers that I downloaded seem to be
 installers of some sort.&nbsp; AMD, MSI and NVIDIA drivers look like they are all .exe files.&nbsp; I'll keep trying to see if I can get them to install.</p>

            The crash was caused by memory corruption.
<br />Let us go with standard steps.
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.

<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).

<p>I ran mem test 86+ on both sticks and it crashed almost immediately. I ran it on one stick over night but only did 5 passes with 0 errors.&nbsp; I'll try again with memtest 86 for ddr4 a d let it run for 8 passes. Then I'll do it with the other stick.&nbsp; Amd, msi
 and nvidia update centers were able to run one one stick of ram. Audio drivers, video drivers, SATA drivers, GIOA (spelling???) and PCI drivers got updated. USB drivers were updated as well but then my keyboard only worked on USB 3.1 ports. I rolled back that
 driver.</p>

            I have run memtest 86 on both my RAM stick in both slots. Stick 1 on slot A, stick 1 in slot B, stick 2 in slot A, stick 2 in slot B. I am now running both sticks. The only way I could get it to post with both sticks is boot it first with 2 in B, then
 shut down and add stick one to slot A. Then it would post into bios. Let me know if you see anything wrong with my attached test results.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a95b17-ff4f-48ef-8cc8-e94bacf65a93?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a95b17-ff4f-48ef-8cc8-e94bacf65a93?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3282277-ab2c-4629-b806-fbb95f78730a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3282277-ab2c-4629-b806-fbb95f78730a?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0c540c-c496-440c-800b-54f70548a1f7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0c540c-c496-440c-800b-54f70548a1f7?upload=true" /></a><a href="http

            The following are the 16 passes made with both RAM sticks. I swapped the sticks after 8 passes and ran another 8. No errors. I am now running a test with all cores simultaneously.

            I ran memtest for 8 passes with all threads running simultaneously.&nbsp; It threw no errors and this is supposed to be the most error prone test. I'm trying to figure out what I can do next to hunt down what caused my memory corruption error codes. Your help
 would be appreciated.

            Hi Saurabh,
<br />click the view tab at the top then click large icons on the ribbon
<br />click the downward chevron next to recent files to hide them.
<br />
<br />please let me know if that does not give you what you are looking for

    <title>TWO Brand new Xbox One X consoles turning off due to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crinimal scum  say:</h3>
<h2>            TWO Brand new Xbox One X consoles turning off due to &#34;overheating&#34;</h2>
                    I have had an issue with my xbox one x wherein it would shut down as soon as i play a game or watch Netflix. I looked into the issue and it seems it turns itself off when it begins to overheat. I had a day one version of the original xbox one sit in the
 exact same spot for 4 years with absolutely no issue ever. My xbox one x began "overheating" about 2 months into use, so i sent it back and they "fixed" it. Naturally, as soon as i plug it in, update, and download some games i begin to play. No more than 10
 min pass into Devil May Cry 5 and my console shuts down. I figure maybe it was a glitch or bug with the game and try something else. Every single game and app that i attempt to run shuts the console down in 10 min or less. I say&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed - See
 guidelines)</strong> i'll just buy a literal brand new xbox one x thinking perhaps someone at the Microsoft Service place was just having an off day when they got my xbox. SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. So i was at the end of my rope with two very expensive bricks. I
 had tried everything that wouldn't void the warranty. By everything i mean EVERYTHING. I did further research and came to the conclusion that what most likely is going on is that Microsoft doesn't properly apply the thermal paste to the CPU of the xbox one
 x's they send out. So, i'll crack open one of the two bricks i have and apply thermal paste myself and see if that fixes the problem. I was hoping someone here had the same issue at some point but to hear the Microsoft Support employee talk i was the only
 xbox one x owner on the surface of the planet to have this problem and that they had no idea how to fix it.&nbsp;

            thanks for the reply! i have it in a very well ventilated area and have tried it in entirely different ares and houses, ventilation is not the issue. Also i have already sent it to microsoft once, waited 10 days and received a still broken console. how
 many times do i need to send the same console back before i can expect results? thanks again.&nbsp;

</p><p>I'm on O365, and do not see any hotfixes applied to Skype, (They don't seem to list any Office updates in "Installed Updates") so the KB's listed in other pages can't be checked. The Lync.EXE is dated Dec 28, 2016</p>

Hi Brian,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
This issue may occur&nbsp;for multiple reasons, and I suggest you:<br />
<br />
1. Check your firewall or proxy settings to see if it blocks Skype for Business from connecting to EWS.<br />
Start your Internet Explorer—on the Tools menu—click Internet Options—Connections—LAN Settings, make sure the Automatically detect settings option is selected, and then restart both Internet Explorer and Skype for Business to see if it works.<br />
2. If it doesn't work,&nbsp;re-install your Skype for Business client.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alison<br />
</p><p />

<h2>            Accidental Deletion of Windows Photo Viewer</h2>
                    <p>I currently am running Windows 7 home premium 64-bit. &nbsp;I accidentally deleted Windows Photo Viewer. &nbsp;How can I go about reloading the driver. &nbsp;I have already upgraded from Internet Explorer 9 to 11, and I have already reloaded my Windows 7 from the disc
 without being able to see JPEG files. &nbsp;They can be opened in Adobe Lightroom, which I also have, but would like to view the thumbnails in my files quickly with photo viewer. &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;thanks.</p>

<p>When Windows Updates fail there is always an error code associated with the failure - but since you mention USB this might be the update of interest:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f53cc50-0597-4250-8d6b-af145e74ba79?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f53cc50-0597-4250-8d6b-af145e74ba79?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the update, then I would do peruse this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your system is working and you want it to keep working never accept hardware driver (chipset, video, audio, network, printer) updates from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>SFC&nbsp; (System File Checker)</p>
<p>Windows update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb (especially for hardware drivers) is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you
 are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<p>When Windows Updates fail there is always an error code associated with the failure - but since you mention USB this might be the update of interest:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f53cc50-0597-4250-8d6b-af145e74ba79?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f53cc50-0597-4250-8d6b-af145e74ba79?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the update, then I would do peruse this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your system is working and you want it to keep working never accept hardware driver (chipset, video, audio, network, printer) updates from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>

<h3> hvidtop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message during windows 10 installation on new computer</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi, I just assembled a pretty expensive computer and installing windows 10 x64 bit on the machine, when it writes the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instruction at 0x00007FFD4A457434 referenced memory at 0x0000023AAA78CA30. The memory could not be written.</p>
</div>
<div>Click on OK to terminate the program.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a faulty memory stick or what are the causes? Please help, I have already waited a long time for replacements of previous ram, which were not compatible with the build. What is the issue here??</p>

<p>If there are two modules then remove one and see if the error is still present. Or take out both (or the one) and reseat the module/s.</p>
<p>Also check other items are seated correctly. Take them out and plug them back in again. Unplug any extra USB items that are not needed during installation.</p>

            I have had a similar issue where the installation media was at fault, if its a bootable usb maybe try another or download the iso again. When you say "replacements", does that mean there is more than 1 ram stick? if so try 1 at a time and see if it changes
 anything

<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how I can get the shortcut back to 'Playback devices' on the menu you get when you right click the volume icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one update it was replaced with 'Sounds' and I don't know about you but I'm not changing my sounds so often I need a shortcut to it.</p>
<p>

    <title>how do I split a 4 hour mp3 file to smaller portions to transfer to CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrycestnik  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I split a 4 hour mp3 file to smaller portions to transfer to CD</h2>
                    http://www.ehow.com/how_7259394_burn-big-file-multiple-cds.html<br />
<br />
I tried this program.&nbsp; It split the file, but it named it filename.mp3.1 and filename.mp3.2<br />
I could not burn those file names to a cd.&nbsp; <br />
I renamed them filename1.mp3 and filename2.mp3<br />
I was able to burn filename2.mp3 ok, but filename1.mp3 reverted to the 93 minute length and would not allow me to burn it because it was over the 80 minute<br />
length.<br />
I also tried renaming them using a and b instead of 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
The reason my question says four hours is because I also have a 4 hour mp3 file I want to split.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
<br />
