<p>Stripped the gears? You don't magically strip the gears. If anything, you'd break the gears.</p>
<p>If going into settings doesn't allow the sensor to move, when telling it to move up, gently pull the sensor up. Don't force it or you'll damage it, but sometimes if it stays in a position for too long, it'll get jammed. If that doesn't work then you'll have
 to repair it. I don't want to suggest manually adjusting it, but if that's your last open then why not right?</p>

            <p>Stripping and breaking the gears are the same thing when it comes to the Kinect sensor. &nbsp;The sensor was never meant to be manually adjusted up or down for any reason.</p>
<p>Do not manually adjust the sensor up or down.</p>

                    <p>Why cannot windows 10 users select a manual option for choosing which updates to download and install? What do you do if you have a problematic update that won't install, but meanwhile preventing other updates from downloading? You can't block the one you
 don't want.</p>

            <p>That is a question suited more to ask directly of Microsoft than this peer-to-peer volunteer-based public worldwide web forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically - you can prevent some updates...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Follow these instructions to not install device drivers automatically:<br />

<h3> csmidha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reactivation of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I had been using free upgrade windows 10 but my motherboard became corrupt so I had to reload new motherboard and get windows reinstalled, duly re-activated.&nbsp; It was going fine but about six months back, I got a message from Microsoft to activate
 windows and this message is appearing as follows:'</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "We cannot activate Windows on this device because we cannot connect to your Organisation's</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Activation Server. Make sure you are connected to your organisation's network and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Error 0x004F074"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I also tried to take assistance from Technical wing of Microsoft and allowed full access to my PC. At the end, they informed that they cannot help in case of Volume license.&nbsp; I am not aware what volume license is.&nbsp; At the same time, I do not
 know the organisation or&nbsp; organisation's network.&nbsp; So I seek your sagacious advice for reactivation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to make it very clear that I am a layman and do not know much about computer. I use it for some emails, games or storage of my data.&nbsp; But to get latest windows 10 is my passion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Awaiting for your advice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanking you,</p>

<p>Couple of things here....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, the free upgrade licence you started with.&nbsp; If that was a OEM licence then it lives and dies with the motherboard.&nbsp; New motherboard = new Windows licence to be purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, you mention that Windows was reinstalled and re-activated?&nbsp; Who did this for you?&nbsp; It sounds like a volume licence was installed at this point.&nbsp; Volume licencing is used by enterprise level organisations where they are licencing hundreds or more
 devices and manage licencing from a central server.&nbsp; It is only applicable to devices that the organisation who pays for the licencing what to have covered under their licencing agreement.&nbsp; So it would be worth looking back at either where you purchased the
 reinstalled windows from, or talking to whomever installed it for you if it was a third party.</p>

<p>As already stated, when I got my corrupt motherboard changed, the mechanic installed&nbsp;<br />
Windows 10 Home 64 bits duly activated.&nbsp; Being&nbsp; a layman, I did not know whether the windows was of Volume Licensing or not.&nbsp; However, I am interested in Windows activation. How can I do it?</p>

</p><p>As for Windows 10, no problem reinstalling on a new SSD:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Unfreakin Real&#33; COD&#58;WaW</h2>
                    
<p>I spent about an hour attempting to play WaW early today. As I expected each and every playlist in WAW is tainted by the hacker pestilence. Most of these hackers take advantage of the Free trials provided by MS. Not sure why the issue has been allowed to
 grow to this point. While playing WaW online you couldn't swing a banhammer without hitting 5 hackers!</p>
<p>Yes this problem is mainly due to Treyarchs lack of upkeep and shotty security, but this is also a direct violation of the XBL Terms of Use. (<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU</a>)
 So it IS still MS responsibility to make sure these people are removed from XBL</p>
<p>There is absolutely no excuse for the lack of action here, because the evidence couldn't be more clear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the makers of the game no longer support it so updates are not going to happen. &nbsp;Luckily the pet is banning and permabanning the &nbsp;hell out of these lame little madders. &nbsp;If you use the infection, you get suspended for two weeks, if you provide
 the infection you are gone for life. &nbsp;Look at the suspension forum and you will see this, they are doing their part.</p>

<p>LMAO why is it that whenever someone has a complaint about hakers call of duty is'nt far behind lol</p>
<p>anyway the only thing we in the community can really do is keep reporting these a** holes I know it does'nt seem like MS are doing anything but I suppose there are just more hackers &amp; cheats out there than thay have people to investigate. &nbsp;I doubt that the
 problems with COD will ever be sorted because by the time they've banned 1 hacker anothers suspention is up &amp; back to their cheating buisness. It's all well &amp; good tempbanning people I mean if you end up banned for exepting an invite to a moded lobby then
 thats bad luck but anyone found to be doing it on a reguler basis regardless of wether thay provided the hack or just used it should be permabanned.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1511 update problems with sleep, touch screen and mouse</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10 pro finished the 1511 update on Dec 20. &nbsp;Since that time, it is unresponsive to the touch screen when used in tablet mode. &nbsp;It also occasionally comes up with a gray, unresponsive screen after sleeping. &nbsp;Also, the external
 mouse plugged in the the docking station (Microsoft 850, brand new) will jump into the upper right hand corner every minute or so. &nbsp;I don't know if it's related, but my event log is full of errors that started at the time of the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3b00d3b-19fc-44cc-98c2-b11977fdb5b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3b00d3b-19fc-44cc-98c2-b11977fdb5b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see my reliability history is a mess since the update. &nbsp;The two failures are "Windows Default Lock Screen - stopped responding and was closed" and "Hardware Error"</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>If you can get into the lock screen, please try to go to safe mode and perform a clean boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>

 and drivers. To start your system in safe mode follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Press and hold Shift key and restart your Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select Troubleshoot.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Advance Option.</span></p>

<h2>            Original Surface Book &#40;Gen 1&#41; - Screen is starting to bubble out and lid is warped</h2>
                    <p>I have one of the first gen Surface Books and it has been absolutely great.&nbsp; I have recently noticed that the lid is slightly warped (after years of use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to close the lid it doesn't close fully.&nbsp; If I look at it from the side, you can see the glass for the screen is warped in the center (almost bubbling out).&nbsp; Turning on the Suface, I also now hae yellow color tint on the top left and right corners
 which is noticeable.&nbsp; Both of these were noticed at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device is out of warranty but I am very concerned there is a battery related issue with this device and that it is no longer safe.&nbsp; I have never had such an issue before with any like device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us! If your child is using a child account and has it set to child default, then they would need permission from an adult in their family in order to accept any friend requests that may be sent via Xbox. If you already have their
 Xbox Live account set the way you wish, then there should be no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to any friend requests that may be received <em>in-game</em> (be it Fortnite or any other game) that would be something that you would need to explore concerning their
<a href="https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Epic Games</a> (or other developer) site with their applicable profile for that area to see if there is an additional setting for you to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Overall Volume control in Win 7 does not change volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_halsey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overall Volume control in Win 7 does not change volume</h2>
                    
<p>The sound chip on my PC's motherboard packed up so, as it's an SFF machine, I had to plug in a USB sound dongle and now have sound.&nbsp; What's happened since though is that the main volume control for Windows 7 doesn't change the volume up and down.</p>
<p>In the mixer panel the individual app volume sliders work and I can still mute all the sound, but I can only change the overall volume using the volume knob on my speakers.&nbsp; Even sliding the volume control up and down from the sound control on the Win7 Taskbar
 won't change the overall volume for the computer.</p>
<p>I've disabled the on-board sound in the BIOS and the USB sound dongle now shows up in Windows as the only sound device.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating, does anyone have an idea why I can't control the overall vooume on my PC?</p>

<p><span>Hi MikeasPatrick,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This may happen if the drivers for the USB sound dongle is corrupted or needs updated driver software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you visit the USB sound dongle manufacturer website download and install the latest drivers for it and
 check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and
 replace them.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information from the installation
 CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista installation disk.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 desktop slideshow timer is always wrong. Bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mugsy323  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 desktop slideshow timer is always wrong. Bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Win10 tablet that I've enabled "Slideshow" for the desktop background set to change every 30 minutes, but instead, the background changes with every boot and then every
<em>ten</em> minutes. I check the settings, it says "30 minutes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reset the timer <em>after</em> booting, it goes back to changing every 30 minutes... until I reboot, then it goes back to the same 10 minute interval. (And wallpaper
<em>still</em> changes at the start of every boot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this have something to do with being a tablet running on batteries or is this a Win10 bug affecting
<em>all</em> systems?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, if a device has a setting for its power plan, some user settings can change automatically which can result in this scenario. For us to effectively assist you, kindly provide us the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Have you made any significant changes to your device that could have triggered the issue?</li><li>Have you checked if you have any other pending updates for your device?</li><li>To remove any possibility of unsuccessful updates, are you using any third-party anti-virus programs? If yes, have you tried to disable them and check for necessary updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>This is an Insignia 11.6" tablet purchased new last year with 1.4GHz quad core processor and 2gb memory (with 32bit version of Win10).<br />
<br />
I have made no significant changes, and there are no pending updates. This problem has existed since I bought it, which was several Windows Updates ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed any third-party AV software, but the computer is virus free (I'm a tech.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Version of Windows is 1607. It once updated to 170x but it had problems. I was told by MS Tech Support that the latest update had a problem with the Intel Atom quad-core mobile processor in my tablet, and was told I'd be contacted when the problem was resolved,
 but no one yet has, so I have not installed the 1700 update.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two Windows Settings where the slideshow feature is available, Background and Lockscreen. Which one are you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's isolate the case if it's only happening on the current account or not by switching to a test account. If you don't have an existing account we can use, please

<p>I'm referring to the Desktop background, not the Lockscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have an "Unknown User" account on my tablet for when others need to borrow it. I haven't tried testing the bug under another account (currently using the default wallpaper settings), but will try it to see if it too has the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Follow-up:</em> I added some new wallpaper images and put them in a folder to be used as a slideshow on my Visitor account, set the wallpaper cycle time to 30 minutes, and it still changed after only 10. :(</p>

<p>Argh, things just went from bad to worse (MUCH worse) trying to prepare for the update. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prepare for the update, I tried running "Disk Cleanup" (as Admin) to delete my "Windows.old" folder, but it could not. I waited two hours before I finally just clicked Cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used "MsConfig" to set the computer to boot to "Safe Mode no GUI" (Command Prompt) so I could delete the "Windows.old" folder by hand (RD /S /Q "c:\Windows.old"), but before I could, when the computer rebooted, it launched "Automatic Repair" and took
 me to the Win10 Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, every time I reboot the computer, it goes into the Troubleshooter and I can't run MsConfig again to go back to Normal boot. And I can't go back to a previous Restore Point because "Disk Cleanup" removed any previous restore points. Other
 attempts to Repair using the Troubleshooter also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT wish to reinstall Windows just to correct this problem when all I need to do is find a way to run MsConfig (or change the boot type w/o it.) Do you know of a fix? :(</p>

<p><span>Hi sookeytwo,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Which version of Internet Explorer do you use?</span></p>
<p><span>b. Were you able to open the game windows in enlarged size earlier?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See if configuring Internet Explorer security settings to allow script-initiated windows without size or position constraints helps you in this
 case.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Internet Explorer.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Tools.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Internet Options.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Security.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Custom Level.&nbsp; <br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down until you find this setting:&nbsp;<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow script-initiated windows without size or position constraints.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Enable.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK to exit out of Security Settings, and then click OK to close Internet Options.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, please try<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>changing
 your resolution</span></a> and check.</span></p>
<p><span>There are other suggestions from Pogo support site that talks about how to tackle this issue. Please go through it. Hopefully one of the solutions
 provided will help you in restoring the game to its normal size.</span></p>

<h2>            Reoccuring BSOD when playing Team Fortress 2 &#40;41 times so far&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is possibly the most frustrating and annoying error that has ever occurred in my entire life. I constantly blue screen of death at random intervals when playing TF2. It just drops dead at random times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specs -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit</p>
<p>Alienware m11x r2</p>
<p>intel i7 dual core U640</p>
<p>8 gb of ram</p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce GT335m&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error -&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Attempt to reset the display driver and recover from timeout failed.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Technical Information:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>*** STOP: 0x00000116 (0xFFFFFA800CD1A4E0, 0xFFFFF88004 585664, 0xFFFFFFFFC000000D, 0x0000000000000003)</span></strong><strong>*** nvlddmkm.sys - Address FFFFF88004585664 base at FFFFF88003C070000, DateStampe 52f651cf</strong></p>
<p>Attached is a picture of the blue screen in case I copied down something wrong. I do have 41 .DMP files, including the most recent, so if anyone needs information from those, I just need to know how to use them.</p>
<p>This is probably the first time I've encountered something I couldn't fix. I'd highly appreciate someone that could fix this. Maybe even explain how they came to the answer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mayank</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and suggestion. I am pleased (in a way) that Window Resource Protection did not find any integrity violation,&nbsp; when I ran an SFC scan. So I'll just have to keep visiting the Community from time to time. What I don't understand, is when
 WMP lost it it's Ripping features or ability to play CD's. (Or any CD playing facility). The E:drive still responds, it simply refuses to utter a sound. I can hear it spinning in the drive. Surely this means it is enabled? How can I enable it just in case?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming back to me. I tried your solution above but it made no difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the following correspondence, under Windows/Windows 10/ Hardware &amp; Drivers/ PC (submitted by mharbour13), but was completely flummoxed. His W10 menu should be the same as mine shouldn't it? :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Go to&nbsp; File Explorer in the W 10 menu on the bottom of the opening page (3rd item from the left on my W10 menu on my computer), after&nbsp; it comes up,&nbsp; single left click on "This PC" on the lower left.&nbsp; That will bring up "Devices and Drives (3)",&nbsp; then insert
 your disc and left click on "DVD RW Drive", that should cause the drive to then recognize the disc and it will bring up the disc name; at that point left click again on the "drive" Icon and it will start the download.&nbsp; My thanks to Elias for this solution.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful if you could throw some light on it for me.</p>

<h2>            Skype not working with Logitech C270 webcam</h2>
                    I just purchased a Logitech C270 webcam.&nbsp; I plugged it into the computer and installed the software.&nbsp; The webcam works fine for photos and videos, but it's not recognized in Skype.&nbsp; In the Skype settings, I selected the webcam in both video and microphone
 boxes.&nbsp; There is a test video slider which I slide to on position and nothing happens.&nbsp; I received a Skype call on my computer and I could see the caller but he could not see me.&nbsp; I could also hear him and he could hear me.&nbsp; That was a bit of a mystery since
 the only microphone I know about is on the webcam.&nbsp; I know that the camera works on the webcam because I can capture pictures and videos with it and also see my self all using the webcam software.&nbsp; I am perplexed.&nbsp; Can you help?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>When it I right click&nbsp;on it the&nbsp;C:&nbsp;&nbsp;drive, the&nbsp;Extend Volume option is greyed out. I know it is greyed out because it is not right next to my unallocated memory. So how can I move my D: unallocated memory that is in Disk 1 over to Disk 0 which has the C:
 Drive in it?</p>

I do not wish to spend money just for this. I have already spent $30 on a system transfer program to transfer all my data from my old computer to this new one.

<p>Hi Aleksander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you encounter issues launching a game on Windows 10, it may be due to one of the following reasons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>A corrupted profile data associated with the game&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>An interruption with the game server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>There are software conflicts that occur when running the game&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>An outdated version of the game&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>An outdated Windows 10 OS</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let's isolate your concern by answering the following questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Are you encountering this issue when launching the game online or offline?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Is this the only game you're experiencing this concern?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've done?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you perform the following troubleshooting methods:</p>

<p>I ran the troubleshooter. nothing came from that.</p>
<p>The game is up to date and so is my windows 10.</p>
<p>I ran the system console file checker thing and that didn't find anything.</p>
<p>The game wont&nbsp;launch offline/online.</p>
<p>This is the only game i have installed from the windows store. Any other games that aren't from windows store work perfectly fine.</p>
<p>And also i cannot find forza horizon 3 in any of my files.</p>

<p>Hello, I found a solution to this problem, although it is not a permanent one, you have to repeat these steps every time you want to play forza horizon 3.
<br />
<br />
1) Open Windows Store</p>
<p>2) Download any app/game or whatever.</p>
<p>3) Open Forza Horizon 3</p>
<p>4) Enjoy!</p>

<p>I finally got it running but I was (and I think I still am) seriously pissed off. It turned out it was antivirus that never ever had any issues with anything and I know it by heart and know all its advanced funtions (COMODO) and then it turned out its also
 because of local account when you use it it does not recognize your licenses uless you download some dummy app or game from ms store. Never ever had such issues before as with running games from MS Store. C'mon!</p>

<p>Gotta agree- I uninstalled it this week. Haven't played a single minute of it as it couldn't get past the spalsh screen at launch before crashing to the desktop. Even the tech support team were no help.</p>

            Hi D33P, that is really strange, 5 processes with the same name . . .
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />In the long list of startup items, look for anything referencing Multiversal
<br />
