            Hi Sniper, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Blue screen errors generate a dump file with diagnostic information to help troubleshooting, so are you able to upload that for us? Here's an article explaining how:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://mywindowshub.com/how-to-configure-windows-10-to-create-dump-files-on-bsod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mywindowshub.com/how-to-configure-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you could try running the System File Checker in case it can repair any corruptions:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />You may also want to run a checkdisk to check your drive's integrity:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type ""cmd"".
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type ""D:"" (without quotes) and press Enter. If your external drive isn't D, change it to the appropriate letter.
<br />- Type ""chkdsk /x /f /r"" (without quotes) and press Enter.
<br />
<br />It'll ask you to reboot so it can check the disk. Press Y and your computer will reboot, check your disk and repair any errors.
<br />
<br />You can also run through this Microsoft Support article helping to troubleshoot blue screen errors:

<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

            System appears to still be in warranty so be sure to contact Dell Support (see below).
<br />
<br />BugCheck 10E, {2d, ffffb20e38022b30, ffffb20e38ae0d20, ffff830b1ab86e70}
<br />
<br />Probably caused by : dxgmms2.sys ( dxgmms2!VIDMM_CPU_HOST_APERTURE::MapRange+da1f )
<br />
<br />dxgmms2.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall Malwarebytes which could be involved in the issue or helping to mask the root cause.
<br />
<br />2. Update the Nvidia Drivers - first check Dell then Nvidia direct.
<br />Also check with their Support and Forums for known issues.

<br />4. Run the memory tests (see methods below).
<br />
<br />5. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />6. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).

<br />
<br />Bug Check 0x10E: VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL
<br />
<br />Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can cause this error. If needed thoroughly check the computer memory with the methods below.
<br />
<br />Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's Support as there could be known issues - also check in their forums.
<br />
<br />Bug Check 0x10E: VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL 0x0000010E  &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br /> Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br />........find at top of the list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory Diagnostic".

<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier.

<h2>            Xbox one fan never shuts off&#33;</h2>
                    Hey guys, Even when I turn my xbox one off, the fan still keeps running. It's not to loud but my 360 was dead silent when of. Does your fan keep running when you shut it down?

<h2>            RAM allocation for applications in Windows 7 x64&#47; Where is the 3GB switch for x86 apps&#63;</h2>
                    Specifically where can I go in Win 7 x64 to control RAM allocation to apps/ a particular app? Someone mentioned the /3GB switch, where is that? I take it x86 apps will only be able to use max 3GB with switch enabled (how please?); can the x64 ones use
 as much as they need/can get? <br />

            Memory allocation is set automatically.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;a 32-bit application is compiled with the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE switch set it is allocated a 4GB address space in 64-bit Windows. If not, it is allocated 2GB.<br />
<br />
For 64-bit applications, if IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE is set when compiled - the default is set - it can use up to 8TB. If IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE is&nbsp;cleared it can use up to 2GB.

<h2>            &#34;Save As&#34; in Snipping Tool in Windows 10</h2>
                    Until today I've been able to use 'save as' to save snips to a file of choice. &nbsp;Today, "save as" initiates a file search, and of course since the title I've given the snip doesn't exist I get a 'file does not exist' message. &nbsp;And I can't save the snip!
 &nbsp;Anyone know what's going on? &nbsp;Better yet, how to fix it?

            What the f**K is wrong that Microsoft can't write a stable program after all these years? Using Win 10 the snip tool has been working until today when it suddenly stops. And you clowns recommend, oh, just use another program, or if that doesn't work just
 fix your own f**king problem and don't bother us to debug the program. We're busy making money. Jerks.

            Eeshwar Kumar, that's fine advice but it doesn't answer the question. Why has the snip tool suddenly stopped working? Why are you recommending using Paint when the snip tool is clearly corrupted for a lot of people and it doesn't appear that even now MS
 is doing anything to fix it?

            I started having the same issue this month.&nbsp; Nothing has changed on my end but I'm sure MS has done some unwanted upgrades since last fall, so it's likely that one of those "updates" changed something.&nbsp; I can fully use the snip program except to save or
 "save as".&nbsp; I don't like using the clipboard to transfer clip to paint.&nbsp; While that is a workaround it is not a fix.&nbsp;

    <title>Network Discovery keeps on turning off in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acmorris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Discovery keeps on turning off in Windows 7</h2>
                    Network sharing keeps on turning off in Windows 7. I keep on clicking to turn it back on but it stays off.
<br />
<br />
I have looked at the forum and the "stop" and "starts" do not always work. File sharing also does not work in Safe Mode. I tried a Restore Point and that didn't work either.&nbsp; I don't know what else to try.
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for helping. <br />

            Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
1) It says that my Windows firewall is run by Mcafee. I disabled McAfee but the same problem occurs.<br />
<br />
2) Troubleshooting did not help.<br />
<br />
3) I stopped and started both SSDP Discovery &amp; Function Discovery Provider Host<br />
then tried to turn on Network Discovery from the link you provided.<br />
<br />
<br />
This did not fix the issue and still keeps on turning off. <br />
<br />
Please let me know what else I should do. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
1) I added the permissions - this did not help<br />
2) I followed all the advice on the link you provided - this did not help. <br />
<br />
- I was able to ping both the IP address &amp; computer name. <br />
- Troubleshooter did not help.<br />
- Computer Browser was off - I started it &amp; turned it to Automatic<br />
- I also made Network Connections Automatic.<br />
<br />
- After this I tried to turn on Discovery + File &amp; Printer Sharing - I click on Save but when I go back , they are off again.
<br />
<br />
- I should mention that I used to be able to have access to my network so I am not sure why all of a sudden it is not working.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
I thank you for your help. <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
You are Welcome.</p>
<p><br />
Please follow the links:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to disable your Firewall and Anti-virus application software for temporarily to check with the issue and if everything is working fine, then you can enable them back.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Disable antivirus software:<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off:<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once you have done with the above steps, turn on Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still face the same issue, then please follow the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to perform a Clean Boot to prevent any conflicting third party applications from interfering with your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To place the computer in a Clean Boot state, you need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below and check with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You need to follow <strong>Step 7</strong> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to Normal Startup after performing all the steps.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

 been the same since.</p>

<p>Any further help out there?</p>

            I'm having the identical Windows 7 problem - I can't keep the "Turn on Network Sharing" radio button on. Disabling windows firewall fixes everything (I can see all my computers on the network) but as soon as I enable the firewall the same error occurs.
 I've tried multiple steps from all kinds of sites online and so far nothing has worked...please help!

                    I have a Windows 7 Laptop that was working fine but now I am unable to connect to a DNS-323 data server. A second Windows 7 machine is connected to the same network and it is still working fine. I am able to see &amp; alter the web based setting for the DNS-323
 unit so the network appears to be ok but I cannot access the files on the drives. When working I had mapped the drive and had been working for several months but stop working over the Christmas break. No settings were changed and the rest of the network is
 fine. Any ideas?

            Hello, I have the same problem. I tried holding right and left space buttons for more than three seconds, for no effect. Then I wanted to contact Microsof support, as was suggested, but it seems that there is no support in Poland. What can I do to get
 this feature to work? The special backspace key was one of the main reasons I bought this keyboard for. Do you offer email support? I can find no info about that on the website.

            <p>I just retried... on Win 8.1 64 Pro. </p>
<p>Works fine testing on a text box (like address line) holding both spaces at the same time for some time and testing backspace/space.</p>
<p>No need for mouse/keyboard center.</p>
<p>However, switching fails a lot. I just tried like 4 or 5 times until I got it. Just retried right now and again it was not so smooth, but it Works.</p>

<h2>            Computer randomly drops internet connection</h2>
                    I have a desktop running Win 7 Pro.&nbsp; The connection goes from painfully slow to dropped while being used.&nbsp; I have reinstalled Windows, unchecked the power management boxes, tried 2 adapters on different ports and still nothing.&nbsp; Since the reinstall the
 problem has actually gotten worse.&nbsp; I have next to no programs installed (it was a microsoft disk not an OEM image) so I don't think it can be a firewall or any programs affecting it.&nbsp; My laptop and iPhone work fine on the network when the desktop drops connectivity
 so I am ruling out the router.&nbsp; What else could be causing this?&nbsp; I am close to just replacing the computer altogether.&nbsp; I have also not moved the computer, so the wireless range should not be the issue.&nbsp; Does anyone know any other reason this could occur?

</span></p>
<p><b>Important Note</b>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.

            Hello thanks for looking into my question.&nbsp; To answer the questions:<br />
1.&nbsp; No antivirus software is installed<br />
2.&nbsp; I am using a wireless connection.&nbsp; The computer is far away from the router or LAN connection<br />
3.&nbsp; The computer is a Dell XPS 420 computer<br />
<br />
I should also note that I have had the computer since 2008 and the problems began occuring in August 2012.&nbsp; At that point Windows 7 had been installed over a year without issue.&nbsp; I replaced the network adapter (USB style) and it corrected the problem for a
 few weeks.&nbsp; No network changes took place around the time of the issue (router has been in use since June)<br />
<br />
I attempted the safe mode restart and the problem went from a connection drop (indicated in the system tray) to a very slow (6.9kb/s) transfer speed and timed out.&nbsp; I was not able to connect to the internet to sign onto Hotmail or the website so I have used
 the snipping tool to get screen shots.&nbsp; The connection seems to be extremely slow or dropped before the system icon shows a connection loss.&nbsp; Right now the problem is back (as I look it is disconnected now).&nbsp; I only have the base Win 7 Pro programs and Microsoft
 Office installed.&nbsp; There are no antivirus or other programs currently on the PC to cause a conflict.&nbsp; I fear it may be hardware related but the system shows no other signs of malaise and I would be at a loss to explain what hardware would have failed.<br />
<br />
Below are the screen shots:<br />

<br />
Yes I tried method 4 and posted the results to my skydrive pictures folder.&nbsp; I Disconnected the computer and plugged it into a wired connection, and the internet works fine on it with that setup.&nbsp; I'm now more confused what the problem could be<br />

<p>
</p><p>As mentioned previously there have been millions of successful installations (including 4 of my own personally plus a many work machines).&nbsp; So generally speaking it can be deemed fit for release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this doesn't mean everyone wont have&nbsp;a problem but all operating systems can suffer from this - my wifes Ipad got bricked with a recent IOS update that wasn't resolved until Apple support intervened.&nbsp; It's software, unfortunately it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advise is to backup first before any update then run it.&nbsp; Worst case it goes pete tong and you've got to rebuild the previous O/S and restore your data from backup.&nbsp; Not the nicest job but not the end of the world.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a backup then that's on you, sorry to be blunt.&nbsp; What happens if the hard drive fails with no backup?&nbsp; You're just as screwed as you are now.&nbsp; Too many people do not backup then complain when something breaks.&nbsp; Things break in IT, that's
 why backups are essential.&nbsp; No excuse for not having something in place now with the low cost of USB drives, Cloud storage etc.</p>

            <p>I accept that users are responsible for providing reasonable protection of their personal and business data. I spend much time advising them on doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past Microsoft provided users with System Restore and not required them to make frequent complete system backups. With the heavily-pushed and hard-to avoid Windows 10 upgrade and its 30-day evaluation period that feature has been damaged. Matters
 are even worse with the Anniversary Update arriving with no warnings and a 10-day evaluation period. What will Microsoft do about people who receive it unbidden and then take a two-week holiday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked the community what needs to be backup up to allow a recovery after 10 days has elapsed, but I haven't received an answer. Is a complete system image needed? How much time must be spent in doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Anniversary Update seems to have caused more problems that the Windows 10 upgrade which generally and deservedly was welcomed (but not for its forced installation). The Quality Assurance of the Anniversary Update is clearly sadly lacking. A Critical
 Update to remove the 10-day rollback limit should be issued NOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions that users are responsible for protecting themselves from products that are not fit for purpose are unreasonable and unhelpful. The cavalier behaviour of issuing such products constitutes Computer Misuse which, in the UK is a criminal offence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sad that Microsoft had tarnished the good reputation of Windows 10 by such malign actions.</p>

<p>A complete system image, yes! Computer teachers, bloggers and journalists have been urging users for years to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My imaging software (Macrium Reflect) makes an image automatically, overnight, every night, while I'm sleeping. In addition, I create images manually before I make any major changes to my system. It takes about 15 minutes to make a complete image of my system
 partition, which includes time for the software to verify the image it created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data is stored on a separate partition, and I make daily images of that as well (and usually more frequently.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How anyone can use a computer without regularly backing up simply astonishes me. That goes double for many people here, who are plainly at the bottom of the barrel in technical skills. There's no shame in that - computers are very complicated. But to leave
 themselves with no way back, to put their critical documents and precious memories at risk with no way to recover them, is simply astonishing.</p>

<p>In my client's office, their data is all held on a Server that is backed up daily to a manually-rotated set of USB drives. But now you are suggesting that
 advice to manage it. In the past only recent backups would have been needed because System Restore should provide enough Restore Points to go back some way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The magnitude of the Anniversary Update is not made clear, nor is the fact that it does not participate in System Restore. This is definitely a regression from Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Paint - Color Box In Monochrome Bitmaps</h2>
                    
<p>When editing a monochrome bitmap in Paint, the Color Box offers various pixel patterns designed, apparently, to be used to simulate shades of gray.&nbsp; How are these used?&nbsp; If I choose any "color" other than all white, I get all black no matter how I draw or
 fill.&nbsp; If I have a black area I would like to change to simulated gray, I would expect to be able to choose a pattern "color" and fill the area.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows error&#58; Critical_Process_Died - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlotte stimeling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows error&#58; Critical_Process_Died</h2>
                    Ok...So, I have an Acer Aspire, Model 5250-0327. Well, about a couple of days after I upgraded to Windows 10, I was playing around on youtube when suddenly, without warning, my computer gives me the error message that says at the bottom: Critical_Process_Died.
 It told me that it was collecting information about the problem, then it would restart. So when I logged back on, I went to the event viewer, and found a couple of errors, and critical errors. It only did it once. But what I don't understand is: is it my computer
 and something that's inside my computer, or is it something else? Btw, I did a disk clean-up and I included the memory dump files so I highly doubt that it's there anymore. Also, I don't have any modified hard-drives, or any unauthorized software on my laptop.
 I didn't really do anything to my laptop to make it act the way it did...it just did it on it's own. If I could get an answer to my issue which happened a couple of weeks ago, I'd appreciate it. Thank You!

<p>
</p><p>1. After upgrading to Windows 10, did you update the drivers?</p>
<p><span>2. Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: As mentioned in the above article, <span>We suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and check for the latest BIOS version and chipset driver and install it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: You may also use a Windows defender to perform a full system scan, which would remove any malicious software and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.

            Yeah, I viewed the event log and found that it had several errors and critical errors. But I don't know what they mean. And I don't think that I updated my drivers in my computer. I just went directly to the windows website, and clicked on upgrade to Windows
 10. I didn't go to Windows update to check if the upgrade offer was in the updates. And I never checked to see if my computer's hardware was compatible with Windows 10. Maybe that's what it is?

            Also, I don't know an official website where I could download the latest drivers and it would be safe. And another thing is, I'm not sure that if I installed the latest drivers, that my Windows would work properly.

    <title>MSXML 4.0 after a failed repair install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julio99  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSXML 4.0 after a failed repair install</h2>
                    
<p>I tried to do a repair install with my Win.7 HP Upgrade Disc. I had a problem in Task Scheduler that couldn't be resolved any other way, but that's a different story. Anyway, when I loaded the Win 7 disc it deleted the MSXML4.0 Core Services file,(I think
 it did anyway) and after the faied repair install the Program Secunia discovered that I had these leftover files that start with C:$Upgrade~OS\OnlineMigGatherWork\agentmgr\CCSIagent\005A53BA\sxsAsm4\msxml4.dll. Secunia was finding these files as vulnerabilities
 even though the main MSXML4.0 Core Services files were deleted through add and remove programs in control panel. By the way, I installed MSXML 4.0 core services SP3 to take the place of the ones I uninstalled or that were uninstalled by the failed repair install.
 Right now I've just put those $Upgrade files under Ignore as far as Secunia goes, but I was wondering if it was OK to just delete those, so I don't have to use the ignore mode of that program. Secunia has told me to ask you as they're not sure if those files
 should go or stay.</p>

<p>Most likely it is ok to delete but before you do, if you can rename the folder or the .dll file and then check to see if you have any problems. If after a week or two and there are no issues then move/burn it to a DVD, CD or USB stick&nbsp;and delete from the
 hard drive. Now wait and test again for a week or two just to be 100% certain.</p>

<h2>            People can&#39;t hear my on Skype</h2>
                    <p>People can't hear me, when I try talking to them on Skype. I checked the settings for my built-in microphone, everything seems to check out. I use a laptop. My wi-fi connection is strong, both my speakers (I use a wireless headset) and my microphone (built-in
 my laptop) are seem to be&nbsp; live and working. The transmitter of the headset is plugged in, and everything is switched on. The latest version of Skype is on my laptop. Please answer asap - I'm at my wit's end.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t redeem &#36;5 microsoft&#47;bing rewards credit</h2>
                    <p>I was referred over here by xbox support to hopefully find someone who can help me out. I recently redeemed my points on microsoft rewards on a $5 code. I got an email that says "congrats your $5 code is here" and when I click redeem it brings me to rewards.microsoft.com and that's it. It doesn't credit my account any money and there's no manual 25 digit code to redeem anywhere on the email. I have tried new browsers, new computers, and clearing cache/cookies and can assure that the link sent in the email is a dud. If I could get a manual code sent or a link that works properly that would be great. Thanks.</p>

    <title>How to open a program on a specific monitor in a dual monitor setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnylightwave  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open a program on a specific monitor in a dual monitor setup</h2>
                    <p>original title: Is there a way to do this in multimonitor?</p>
<p>I'm using multimonitor.&nbsp; I would like to set up a program (photoshop) so that it opens up maximized on whichever monitor I have the desktop icon on (I will put the icon on both monitors).&nbsp; Is this possible?<br />
<br />
The reason I want to do this is one of my monitors is a Cintiq display that I only use periodically.&nbsp; So I use photoshop on that display to do the actual drawing, but then I want to use photoshop on the main display when I cut up my assets and save them and
 other operations like that.&nbsp; It would be a tremendous pain to move photoshop constantly back and forth every time I change my workstream.<br />
<br />
So is there any way?&nbsp; Some kind of way to divide the two monitors so they seem like two different computers, or two different users, or something?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Ive not tried these, sadly I don't have two monitors :-(</p>
<p>But I think you need 3rd party apps to do this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ultramon</a> and/or <a href="http://www.murgee.com/MurGeeMon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MurGeeMon</a> which may do what you require. Both appear to be free to try but I believe you have to purchase then for long term usage. Check for the right versions for your setup
 if there is a choice i.e. 32 or 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I say, I've not tried either, so AV check before installing them, but from what I've read they should be OK, and they are available from CNET it appears.</p>

            I tried out Ultramon and MurGeeMon, but alas, it doesn't do what I need.&nbsp; Seem like pretty good programs otherwise, though!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It seems kinda crazy that this functionality isn't baked into Windows, though... Windows works well for people who want to treat two monitors like one big desktop, but if you want to quarantine the contents of either one, it's got nothing for ya.<br />

                    After installing Windows 7 Media Player no longer works. When I go to the Program Files on C: it is there but it is not showing up on the Control Panel&gt;Programs. I used the Windows check for compatibility and it doesn't show up in any of the listed programs.
 Tried to down load it again but I cannot complete the download. How do I get rid of it and download it again so that I can use it?

<h2>            Documents folder shows both in and out of OneDrive folder, as well as in a &#34;library&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Why does file explorer show my Documents folder both in OneDrive (where it really exists) and in my home folder (where it does not really exist)? And what is this library thing that also has a redundant way of accessing the Documents folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words,</p>
<ol>
<li>if I go to&nbsp;C:\Users\&lt;myname&gt; there is no Documents folder, BUT</li><li>if click on my home directory icon on the desktop it DOES show me a Documents folder, an apparent conflict with number 1.</li><li>If I look at Libraries I see a Documents Library that contains the same Documents folder, an apparent redundancy.</li></ol>
<p>This folder is actually in (and only in) my OneDrive folder. If I put a file in any of those places it shows up in all places, so it's really all the same place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there multiple, unrelated, concepts conspiring to obfuscate things to the point where I might inadvertently delete something I shouldn't?</p>

<p>FWIW</p>
<p>Here, I do have a C:\users\mike\documents&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;folder but it only contains some access denied links to /my music/my picture/my videos -- if I drop an mp3 on the music folder there, it magically appears in the library music folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the library folders here mirror onedrive folders for convenience, I try to keep those collapsed and not showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the explorer folders under MyPC on the left explorer tree are the library folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I always save things to onedrive folders &amp; yes they also appear in the magical library folders which I thought I've read will be discontinued in the future.</p>

</p><p><span>Let's hope so. Microsoft has a habit of inventing new concepts, or new names for old concepts. That muddies the waters making it hard to navigate through Microsoft's world. Another thing they have really mucked up is
 the concept of a network.</span></p>
