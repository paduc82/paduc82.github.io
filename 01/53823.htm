<p>You can all buy / downlaod the same picture and use it. Is there a way to make your own gamer picture? Yes and no. You can use an xbox camera to take a picture of yourself / whatever you want a picture of and use that as your gamerpic. This picture will
 ONLY be seen by your friends though and not by everyone on live. </p>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

    <title>How can I make files in my Programs folder read&#47;write&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> staybolt614  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make files in my Programs folder read&#47;write&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have read many posts on many forums but have yet to find an answer. Some questions are complex involving multiple computers, networks etc. I have simply two home desktops for personal use, nothing complicated. I need to edit files in my Program Files and
 Program Files (x86) folders. I have full administrative permissions yet whenever I change files to read/write they default back to read only. I think I understand why MS has done this but as we are not all green horns with computers there must be some way
 to take control of our own files? I can understand the system files being read only but why my personal files? Sounds like Cyberdine taking over to me. Come on MS lets have some feature that the owner can at least choose how he/she wants to use their system.</p>
<p>Is there any known way to take control of the files in the Program Files folders and make them read/write in Win 7???? Any help appreciated</p>
<p>Dave K.</p>

Why? I can't think of any GOOD reason why you should either need or want to edit files in those folders...<br />

            Microsoft implemented UAC to protect Windows against rogue programs doing nasty things behind your back. It has nothing to do with treating users as greenhorns. If you do not like it then you can disable UAC. If you do then you should also create a System
 Image that you can fall back on in case things go bad.

<p>Most respondents in this forum, including myself, are volunteers from the Windows user community. They do not work for Microsoft and they are not paid by Microsoft.</p>
<p>About your actual question: When I turn off UAC then I am able to create/modify/delete files or folders in the Program Files folder without getting challenged, as long as I am logged on under an admin account. If you cannot do the same I then should adjust
 your NTFS permissions accordingly.</p>

            These are all 32 bit programs and function fine in the 32 bit Program Files (x86) directory. The exception is I can not set them to read write, they default to read only even though they do go through the process of being changed to read/write. As soon
 as I open another program and go back to the one I had set for read/write it has again defaulted to read only. UAC is turned off. I have admin control and control of the programs. I have other software that needs to write to some of these files to update them
 and I myself sometimes have a need to edit the contents. I simply want to know if there is any way, through registry editing or what to allow me to set certain programs to read\write. There is simply no need to purchase new software for WIN 7 64 bit if it
 is even available.

<p>I stand corrected on the programmer question. I am grateful for you folks who do volunteer and help others.</p>
<p>I do not understand how to change or even locate the NTSF permissions. If you are speaking of right clicking the program folder and setting the security permissions I have those all set giving me permissions and control. I can delete folders and files just
 fine, I simply can not get them to stay read/write. I can uncheck the read only box, run the program to set them read/write and as soon as I exit and come back they are all read only again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps my UAC is not turned off?? The slider is set to "Never notify" Is that correct? MS is not really clear on this that I have found.</p>

<p>When I temporarily turned off UAC on my machine I put the slider all the way down, same as you reported.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of commands I ran from the Command Prompt while UAC was off. When UAC is on they fail unless I open the Command Prompt under elevated privileges.</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)&gt;md "Microsoft Office\Test"<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)&gt;dir &gt; "Microsoft Office\Test\dir.txt"</p>
<p>To modify NTFS permissions at the Command Prompt you can run this command:<br />
<em>cacls "Microsoft Office" /e /t /g administrators:F</em></p>
<p>This command will examine them and check if they stick:<br />
<em>cacls "Microsoft Office"</em></p>
<p>You can, of course, replace "Microsoft Office" with any folder name you like. The /T switch makes the command recursive.</p>

            <p>Hello Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Is it a Built-in SD card reader or external?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>If you are reffering to External Card reader, then try&nbsp;connecting to a different USB port and then check if that gets detected. Also check with another SD card if it is getting recognized or detected or you may even check if the same SD card is getting recognized
 or detected on other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the methods provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Install the latest drivers from the manufacturer website and even make sure <br />
the driver is compatible with the version of operating system installed on your <br />
computer, check if it works<br />

            I tried your various ideas but to no avail. I see now that the drive isnt even showing in windows explorer. I have not made any changes to the computer. My computer is a laptop hp dv7 6185-us. The drive is internal as im sure you have figured out by now.
 should be an easy fix but its like one day the drive was there and then it was gone. &nbsp;The only thing i couldnt try was running in compatability mode as i didnt know the file location.

    <title>BIOS and Bootloader messed up. Help&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skylargrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            BIOS and Bootloader messed up. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of the last two days, a lot of stuff happened.</p>
<p>I should probably start off with the installation of Kali, which was the root of all the problems.</p>
<p>I sucessfully installed Kali alongside my Windows 8.1 and everything went smoothly; the installation was successful and had no problems but Kali wouldn't show up in the boot menu. (The GRUB boot loader never showed).</p>
<p>So after some reading, I installed an app called EasyBCD to help add Kali to the bootloader but when I did that, I think it corrupted my&nbsp;Windows Bootloader.</p>
<p>After a restart, Kali didn't even show up in the Bootloader, it only had Windows. And when I ran Windows, I got the following error:</p>
<pre>Your PC needs to be repaired

The Boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors.

File: \Boot\BCD</pre>
<p>Now I'm not sure what happened at this point but the GRUB bootloader&nbsp;became visible and I was able to login into Kali once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a state of panic, I forgot about Lenovo's OneKey recovery which probably could have easily solved the problem and instead, I downloaded a 3rd party app called EasyRE after following this tutorial:&nbsp;https://neosmart.net/wiki/0xc0000034/ and did as instructed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I did this, my Windows has been misbehaving along with my BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this was finished, the GRUB bootloader&nbsp;was nowhere to be seen, along with my stock Lenovo loading screen.</p>
<p>It was replaced by the Windows 8 loading screen.</p>
<p>My partitioned drives were all removed and a new one called WINRE_DRV (1000MB) became visible. (The rest became unallocated&nbsp;memory, able to create new volumes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd try installing Kali again but no matter what boot option I chose in the BIOS, it always boots to Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the OneKey recovery feature of Lenovo to reset my Windows but it says that all the backups are gone.</p>
<p>My laptop did not come with System Recovery DVDs, it only came with the OneKey button.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Today morning when I turned on my laptop and opened the BIOS, it didn't show my harddrive as an option to boot from (i.e: Windows was not available as a boot option).</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure what I did after that, but after some repeated restarts, I managed to get Windows 8 back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet created a Windows 8 Recovery USB for my laptop. Will creating one now and using it to restore my laptop fix Windows along with the BIOS, bootloader?</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Windows 10 maximising windows when moving to a different monitor, why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use two monitors on my PC but for some reason windows 10 has started to maximise windows when moving the window from monitor 1 to monitor 2.</p>
<p>Have gone to display settings, multitasking, and tried turning each option on and off but it makes no difference. And each time I go into that setting, the first option defaults to off, even after I left it to on, so all the snap options are off.</p>
<p>So why does it keep resizing to maximum every window I drag over? Making this unuseable, I don't want it to keep maximising my windows unless I tell it to.</p>

    <title>Forza 7 stuck in download loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erik1982nl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza 7 stuck in download loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Forza 7 download is stuck in an infinite download loop. The file is supposed to be 98GB. I've downloaded nearly 300GB so far and it just won't stop downloading. I've downloaded and ran the troubleshootingapp for Microsoft Store. It found a problem with
 the cache and supposedly fixed it, which it didn't. I uninstalled the store and reinstalled it. Did not work. Since the game isn't installed I can't seem to find a map where the downloaded file is stored so I can delete it and start a fresh download.&nbsp;I've
 contacted Microsoft by phone and the employee did a WSreset which did not work. After fooling around in PowerShell he gave up and forwarded my E-mailadress so hopefully there is somebody at Microsoft that can help me but no reaction so far...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have played the game, I like the game, I don't want a refund. I just want to play it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for your reply Jason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third step of E for Excels answer resumed the download at 40 GB of 304GB which is more that it did before so I'll just let it go ahead for now and see where it gets me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you posted</p>

<strong><strong><span><span>troubleshooter</span></span></strong></strong>.<br />
<br />
Open <strong><strong><span><span>Control Panel/Troubleshooting</span></span></strong></strong>.<br />
<br />
Under <strong><strong><span><span>Appearance and Personalization</span></span></strong></strong>, select the<strong><strong><span><span>Display

<br />
In the Troubleshooter dialog, click the <strong><strong><span><span>Advanced</span></span></strong></strong> link and place a<strong><strong><span><span>check

            I am so sick of these canned responses. You realize the query says LOCKED OUT OF WINDOWS 10 local account, yet you keep sending people to their start menu on the desktop as if they can even get to that. Your support is less than desirable on any given
 day. <br />

<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and I have had a skype for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, since the middle of April of this year my skype is not connecting.&nbsp; For a while it was telling other people I was online even though my online notification had the blue spinning arrow icon
 and I was still able to use it as if were actually connected.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for at least 3 days, my skype is literally not connecting.&nbsp; It has everyone marked as offline and my messages are not sending at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times.&nbsp; And now my microsoft store has been saying it's not connected (whenever
 my laptop runs on wifi)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly is the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            VPN Issues Server 2012 R2</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first time posting, so if this has been resolved in another post, I haven't seen it while searching the web for solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this particular issue for over a week and I am at a loss. I have a VPN Server (2012 R2) that has been working fine using a PSK. I have just recently purchased a 2017 Surface Pro with Windows 10 Pro. Before I did anything, I ran Windows
 Update and it's all up to snuff. After setting up the VPN connection, I continue to get the following error "Can't connect to XXXX, The L2TP connection attempt failed because the security layer encountered a processing error during initial negotiations with
 the remote computer". When I check the server I see Event ID 20271 "The user user1 connected from x.xxx.xx.xxx but failed an authentication attempt due to the following reason: The remote connection was denied because the user name and password combination
 you provided is not recognized, or the selected authentication protocol is not permitted on the remote access server". However, the same VPN connection continues to work fine for other laptops inside of my organization, just not on this one client. Here are
 the things I have done to try and troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Delete and reconfigure the VPN</li><li>Disabled the Firewall on the client and server</li><li>AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule = 2</li><li>Rebooted the VPN Server&nbsp;</li><li>Made sure VPN Server had the latest Windows Updates</li><li>MS-CHAP v2 with using logon credentials checked</li><li>Compared VPN settings on the client with the problem, as well as a working client, and settings are all the same.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end. Any help would be appreciated. Thank You.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On version 1803 (OS Build 17134.48) using&nbsp;Surface_Dock_Updater_v2.12.136.0.msi, applying the latest firmware to my Surface Dock hangs at 25%. Event log output below... any ideas? Fortunately it doesn't seem to cause the dock to fail on power cycle</p>

<p>Hi Ade,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devices may be unable to complete the update because of a software problem. I recommend you perform a two-button reset to reload the software and allow it to update the dock successfuly. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Switch off your Surface.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds. It will enter the UEFI. Wait until the screen goes off before releasing both buttons.</li><li>Switch on your Surface normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset, try updating the dock again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install KB2732487 - error code 800B0100</h2>
                    All the latest round of updates on 15/8 loaded ok except the above. . However whilst they were installing my screen went blank and computer froze and I had to shut down via power button. On restarting KB2732487 had not installed. I've tried FixIt, Hotfix
 for Windows,MS Update standalone package, sfc scannow and all help articles on the error code with no success. I have a feeling that somehow the file got corrupted when the pc froze and there maybe a bad link in the registry, windows or somewhere else. Anybody
 have any ideas? BTW Windows Update seems to be working normally otherwise. <br />
PS Have Windows 7 Home Premium 64Bit.<br />

<p>Hi Devin,</p>
<p>
