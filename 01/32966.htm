            <span>Hi Petergrossman,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
I would need few details about the issue that you've posted.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * What is the name and the model of the printer?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Did you receive any driver updates for your printer through Windows Update?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Does the printer print other applications in color?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Meanwhile, try the following steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Try printing the default pictures in the Windows Photo Galery and check whether you get a colour print.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Try uninstalling the printer driver and re-install it.<br />
<br />
Also check for the color setting of printer. Go to the printer settings and make sure you have selected the option that enables color.<br />
<br />
<strong>To Print a picture follow these steps:-</strong><br />
<br />
If you have a printer connected to your computer, you can make prints of digital pictures. The quality of your prints depends upon a number of factors, including the type of printer paper, your choice of ink, and printer settings. You can control many of these
 settings when you print the picture, but also keep in mind that the overall quality and resolution of the digital picture you are printing will affect your final result.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Open Windows Photo Gallery by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Click the picture you want to print.<br />
<br />
To select more than one picture, hold down the CTRL key while you click the pictures that you want to select.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; On the toolbar, click Print, and then click Print.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; In the Print Pictures dialog box, select the printer, paper size, print quality, print style, and number of copies you want to print.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; When you are finished choosing how you want to print your pictures, click Print to start printing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>To Choose print options follow these steps:-</strong><br />
<br />
Before you send a print job to the printer, decide if you want to print some or all of the document or webpage. You might, for example, need to make a note of which pages to print or select part of a document before sending it to the printer.<br />
<br />
Here are common printing tasks to consider:<br />
<br />
1. To print only part of a document or file, make a note of the page numbers for each page that you want to print.<br />
2. To print part of a page or webpage only, select the content you want to print before printing.<br />
3. To print a specific page, click any place on the page before choosing print options for the document.<br />
4. The page that you clicked becomes the current page and you can print it by selecting that option in the Print dialog box.<br />
<br />
<br />
After you decide what to print, choose how the print copies should look, and then select a printer.<br />
Use print preview<br />
<br />
To see what the print copy will look like before you print it, open the document in a program that offers a print preview. Print preview is typically located on the File menu for a program. You should be able to preview each page of the document. In some programs,
 you can choose print options in the preview mode, and then print directly from the preview. In other programs, you might have to close the preview, change the document or your printer settings, and then print it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you preview or print a document and it doesn't look the way you intended, you might need to edit the document or change your print options. For example, if only part of your document fits on the printed page, you might need to reduce the font size, decrease
 the margins, or change the page layout, and then try printing it again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

    <title>xp hangs up while logging off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peacepilgrim9  say:</h3>
<h2>            xp hangs up while logging off</h2>
                    I have XP Media Edition, SP 3.<br />
<br />
As of a couple of weeks ago, when I try to restart of shut down, when Windows gets to the part where it says it's "logging off", it can take 15 minutes or more before it finally shuts down.
<br />
<br />
Trouble shooting I've already done:<br />
<br />
I disabled all startup items to see if it's a service that is being loaded that is causing the problem.&nbsp; That didn't fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I have run Registry Mechanic and Winzip Registry Optimizer and still it hangs up on shut down or reboot.<br />
<br />
I've also installed UPH Clean, which is suppose to help with logging off or out of user account.&nbsp; Still no effect on logging off.<br />
<br />
Given what I've said above, does anyone have good idea of how to fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had you run the registry cleaners previously.&nbsp; I ask this because they can be a big cause of computer problems and with you mentioning them I was wondering......?&nbsp; They should never be used, especially if the user is not an expert.&nbsp; If you didn't, your original
 problem could have possibly been solved with the uph clean solution, but with you using the registry cleaners you have, more than likely, damaged your XP installation and will only fix it by performing either a repair install (keeps your existing documents,
 photo's, films etc)&nbsp;or a clean install (lose everything and start again.)</p>

    <title>My laptop only plays sound on one programme at a time - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My laptop only plays sound on one programme at a time</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 Ultimate, Acer Aspire 4820T laptop 64 bit with no attached speakers, just the built in ones. A while ago I noticed that if playing music or videos on itunes/Quicktime/WMP and trying to get sound on a clip on youtube/fb/bbcnews using
 chrome or ie9 I can only get sound on one at a time. I have to close itunes and refresh browser, sometimes even close and reload it to get sound. Then if watching youtube on Chrome or ie9, opening itunes, things wont play.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tested windows sounds when playing music on itunes, or youtube on different browsers and the windows sounds work as soon as the browser tab is closed or has something without audio.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read some forums and think I saw something about "exclusive access" to audio devices. I don't know where to find this check box, or if this is the right idea.</div>

<p>

</p><p>https://forums.techguy.org/threads/sound-only-works-one-program-at-a-time.987817/</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the problem already typed out for you to read:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I own a Dell Studio XPS, running MS Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit SP1.</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fforums.techguy.org%2fproxy.php%3fimage%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fi1116.photobucket.com%252Falbums%252Fk571%252FBad_Boyl2%252FPlaybackDevices.png%26amp%3bhash%3d1bc8acdb7ac6ccf9b1db98ec9122712e" /><br />
<br />
The problem is that the sound only works with one application at a time, meaning, if I open iTunes first, and then Skype, only the sound on iTunes will work. If I close both, then open Skype first, and iTunes second, then only the sound from Skype can be heard.
 This has happened with every program so far, such as Google Chrome (watching a video on YouTube), video games, and VLC Media Player. I've had this problem for as long as I can remember, as this computer is fairly new.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I'm willing to divulge any more information required. I didn't want to overload this post with information that might otherwise be useless, or just serve to confuse people trying to answer and resolve my problem.

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Error code 1722 is usually associated with the licensing of the game. This error occurs when attempting to install the game a second time after uninstalling. Microsoft was aware of this error and has created an article with steps
 that can resolve it. Follow this article:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/928080/error-1722-when-reinstalling-flight-simulator-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error 1722 when reinstalling Flight Simulator X</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The other
 error code 1603 should also disappear after doing the recommended steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reply back if there are improvements.</p>
<p>

<p>How does it look like on your end? The link opens a page with instructions on how to resolve error code 1722. If you're using Microsoft Edge to view the page, I suggest that you clear the browser's cache and history to view the page. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>To view your browsing history, select <strong>Hub </strong>&gt; <strong>History </strong>
.</li><li>Select <strong>Clear all history</strong>.</li><li>Choose the types of data&nbsp;you want to remove from your PC, then select <strong>
Clear</strong>.</li><li>If you use Cortana and want to clear browsing history that's stored in the cloud, select
<strong>Change what Microsoft Edge knows about me in the cloud</strong>, then select
<strong>Clear browsing history</strong>. For information on what does clearing your history do, go to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10607/microsoft-edge-view-delete-browser-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you're using another browser, please seek assistance from its support page on how to clear cache and cookies. After clearing these, click

                    <p>I can't sign in to my Windows account, it shows this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem can usually be fixed by signing out and signing back in again. If you continue, any file changes will be lost.(That may not be exact but it says everything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sign out and back in as the message says and no change.</p>
<p>

<p>The issue is likely a corrupted account.&nbsp; If it won't prepare a temporary account for you to sign into to try to repair things, then try these steps, all illustrated by linked tutorials:</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can boot into Safe Mode with Networking via <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to enter Windows 10's Safe Mode | PCWorld</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking (preferred) or Safe Mode, work through the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist - Microsoft Community</a><span>&nbsp;
</span>to try to repair your account.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If necessary you can run the Repair commands from the Command Prompt via
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Advanced Startup Options</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no access to Safe Mode or it doesn't help, then use one of these <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
4 Ways to Enable Built-in Administrator Account on Windows 10.</a><span>&nbsp; </span>
If you can't access Windows you may need to use Method 4 and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

BIOS Boot Menu Key</a>,<span>&nbsp; </span>choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen Repair Your Computer link to enter Advanced Troubleshoot options.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once into the Built-in Admin Account you can run through the same checklist to try to restore the User account, but if it won't repair or you want a fresher start then<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

 account, test that all programs work (most will) or reinstall them, then when you're sure you have everything, delete the old account and disable the Hidden Admin account which should only be used in case of emergencies.

<h2>            BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, my laptop will blue screen and always say BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER ERROR almost everyday. I haven't been doing anything excessive on the laptop and there isn't a code such as "FX00000089" ect. The only thing it says is the
 USB error and when I look up the problem I only get fixes for previous Windows versions such as vista and 8.1. Anybody know a way to fix this?</p>

    <title>Programs in the startup folder don&#39;t autostart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanatica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs in the startup folder don&#39;t autostart</h2>
                    <p>Programs in the startup folder `shell:startup` and `shell:common startup` should autostart. How come they don't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In those directories, I've put a simple shortcut to taskmgr.exe. When I doubleclick it, it starts just fine. When I logon, it doesn't start at all. Doesn't even try. In Windows 7, this worked flawlessly... It doesn't appear this functionality was removed
 from Windows, or why would the startup folder have a fancy way to access it?..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with UAC disabled. Then, it works. But I want&amp;need UAC enabled, just like on Windows 7 where it doesn't impact startups either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the task manager, to the Startup tab, I DO see the startup item there. And it's enabled. But it's not, since it doesn't bloody start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried this with a scheduled task - that doesn't appear to work *at all*, scheduled tasks, as it appears, don't start at all - not even manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the only one with this issue - just do a search. I deliberately created a new topic because I don't want to dwell on half-baked solutions to a problem I'm not even supposed to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do we fix this once and for all?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is actually normal, unfortunately.&nbsp; The issue started with Win 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember the exact reason, but there is some kind of policy change that prevents a lot of programs from starting out of the Startup folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Taskmanager, I have a utility called SpeedFan that also will not start from the Startup Folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that there is a way to modify the policy, but that then messes something else up, so I never tried it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if enough people complain, Microsoft can correct this somehow, and still maintain whatever security issue is behind their reasoning...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not helpful. DISM will correct any corruptions my installation may have, which isn't the problem. Clean Boot also can't fix the problem - if anything, it will introduce the problem as it skips startup programs. I want the opposite! I want it to NOT SKIP
 my startup programs.</p>
<p>

<p>I know about the policy change. I think you might be referring to EnableLUA=0, which is exactly the same as disabling UAC, which is a horrible workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question changes into: <strong>what precise conditions have to be met for a startup program NOT to be skipped autostarting?</strong></p>

            <p>We shouldn't need to resort to TechNet for this. Startup is a feature that any user might use, and any user who does, will scratch their heads over why the heck it won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because that's what it looks like: it just simply doesn't work. 100% reproducible on every win10 pc on the planet. Microsoft should be able to repro this issue in 2 minutes flat.</p>

<p>If you are all so glad to help us then why not actually help us instead of promising to help us in the future? It's like political powers negotiating about starting negotiations to start negotiating an issue. Just total double-speak.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that&nbsp; Windows 10 is blocking a multitude of apps and drivers from running at startup that simply do not pose a threat.&nbsp; Even apps that I've manually "unblocked" in the property options are STILL being blocked. The ONLY way around this is to
 disable UAC in the registry. How appalling! I</p>

<div>I will definitely check out the link you offered, &nbsp;and hopefully have this rectified by the end of&nbsp;</div>
<div>the day ~ they won't be back until next year now, it's just a case of fixing this for the guest room</div>

            <p>I have a 6 year old grand-daughter who in earlier years used to help me fix client computers. She has no fear of them, and aged 4 and in Junior Kindergarten, her end of year report noted that she could navigate around a computer with ease and even helped
 others in the class.. :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is quite adept with a keyboard,&nbsp;mouse,&nbsp;trackball and touchpad, and has recently learned how to reset the wireless connection having watched me do it just once! Fortunately, she still leaves password creation to me..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She can also do impromptu 'unofficial demos of iPad minis to other kids in the Apple store, and is currently the only person I know who can operate a Blackberry Playbook without getting into a mess with it..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your experience reminds me that I have far greater challenges in the future trying to hold back the 'monster' that I appear to have created..

<p>Just wondering if anyone else is having any troubles playing Black Ops after installing the new console update? &nbsp;Cannot get past the Xbox Live selection in the multiplayer section of the game. &nbsp;Xbox Customer service states it was due to the Activision update,
 Activision claims the opposite. &nbsp;Anyone know a solution?</p>

            <span>Hi Carlos,<br />
Does the issue occur when you are activating Kaspersky Internet Security?<br />
<br />
If you are getting the error message when you are accessing Kaspersky Internet Security, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Kaspersky Internet Security activation error: Cannot set up SSL connection<br />

<h2>            How to select the Windows SDK 8.1 when using CMake in Visual Studio 2017&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When importing a CMakeLists.txt file using File-&gt;Open-&gt;CMake... in Visual Studio 2017 the targets get configured using the file CMakeSettings.json. This is described
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/ide/cmake-tools-for-visual-cpp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An environment can be configured by supplying the "inheritEnvironments" field in the&nbsp;CMakeSettings.json file. I assume that this selects the compiler shipped with the IDE (VC 14.1x for Visual Studio 2017). However I didn't find any way to select the SDK
 version. I would like to use Windows SDK 8.1 but the inherited environment&nbsp;"msvc_x64_x64" provides the latest installed Windows 10 SDK. Is there any way to select the Windows SDK 8.1?</p>

            Yes. Since the game will be a Play Anywhere title, you can play it on both if purchased digitally.

Contact Canon to find if they have, or are planning to have, a 64-bit<br />
Windows 7 driver for it. If the answer is no, you need a new printer.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10  -- configured identity is incorrect</h2>
                    <p>I have been having an ongoing battle with Windows 10.&nbsp; First it was the&nbsp; Desktop is no accessible -- access denied problem.&nbsp; I tried many of the suggested fixes.&nbsp; None seemed to work.&nbsp; Some times I needed to cold boot the system up to 6 times to not see
 this error.</p>
<p>Not sure what I did but I no longer get the error.&nbsp; Jinxeed myself now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second error that was happening at the same time was the Configured Idenity is Incorrect error.&nbsp; Tried many of the suggested</p>
<p>fixes.&nbsp; Sometimes, multiple logon would work.&nbsp; What appears as a work around now is to login with my regular ID, get the error, switch the user to Administrator, login-- no ptoblem.&nbsp; Switch user back to my regular ID and the error is not there andmy desktop</p>
<p>image is there.&nbsp; Every time I do not see the desltop background image I have the Config error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running out of ideas.&nbsp; I have so many applications associated with my regular ID, I am not keep to start another user.&nbsp; My current</p>
<p>question is how to trouble shoot, track &amp; isolate the Config problem.&nbsp; It does not happen in safe mode.&nbsp; Are there tools to track the bootup --&nbsp; log the process and analyize the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 ver is 10.0.14393.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried creating a new user profile for your Windows 10, and see if the result is the same? It can be that the profile you are using now is corrupted of some sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not, try and see the result. Here's how to create a new user profile, just in case you didn't know:</p>

Right clisk at the taskbar &gt; make sure there is no check mark at " Lock the taskbar " &gt; if yes, uncheck it.</p>
<p>Rest your cursor iNSIDE the taskbar &gt; left click and HOLD &gt; drag the taskbar towards the bottom. It might take a few tries to achieve that.</p>
<p>When the taskbar is back at the bottom, make sure you lock it.</p>

            Hi, open window: <em>Start -&gt; Run</em> <br />
write: <em>secpol.msc</em><br />
open&nbsp;<em>Local Policies -&gt; Security Options</em><br />
and change&nbsp;<em>Administrator account status</em> for <strong>Enabled</strong>.<br />
Administrator&nbsp;account is Disabled by default.<br />
Now U should have access to account Administrator.<br />

<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I am using SoundTap Streaming App.&nbsp; Since I did update the driver, the app had a routine that allowed the capture of streamed sound which is what I was trying to accomplish.&nbsp; And, it worked.&nbsp; I am a happy camper.&nbsp; Appreciate your suggestions
 and guidance.</p>

<h3> glennkoko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype- incoming calls issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Skype on my Android box and it was working fine until today when I tried to answer a call and the following happened:</p>
<p>The incoming call pops up and for 1 second I can see all the answering options. But then, right after, all of the buttons disappear and the whole incoming call screen shifts lower to the left (cutting off all the buttons, I assume).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting, reinstalling, and clearing the data and cache- no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have the same problem on an Android Tablet. I noticed that the screen shifts lower to the left but if I turn in vertical position the tablet and the auto rotation of the display is activated I can see the answering button again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attach the screenshots:<br />
- this is the screen in the first seconds of the call<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3eb47f93-a196-4765-ac6c-2c61545a353c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3eb47f93-a196-4765-ac6c-2c61545a353c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- </p>
<p>
</p><p>after few seconds the screen fall and the answering buttons are not visible any more</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03c5632f-04a6-4481-bca2-4390b7785ead?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03c5632f-04a6-4481-bca2-4390b7785ead?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if I turn the tablet the buttons reappear</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/109c289f-01a8-44bf-85db-89ef439dadcf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/109c289f-01a8-44bf-85db-89ef439dadcf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet is used by my parents and the auto rotation could cause them problems so I switch it off and they use the tablet always in horizontal position.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestion.</p>

<h2>            how to merge messenger to skype</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to get specific answers about merging Messenger with Skype, but when I get onto Skype support, they tell me to contact Microsoft. There are no answers to my questions&nbsp;in the Microsoft&nbsp;faqs, and&nbsp;I can't find any way to get to a live person on Microsoft.
</p>
<p>As I live in Australia, there is no "live chat" available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can get a live connection to them please? These are the&nbsp;questions:
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;When merged with Skype;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;"</span>(1)&nbsp; I will still get a pop-up in the task bar telling me when
 I get a message in my Hotmail inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>(2) Will I be able to see how many messages are in my Hotmail
 inbox, by clicking on the icon in the task bar? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(3) Will I still be able to get straight into my Hotmail inbox, by clicking on the icon on the task bar
 and then clicking on inbox? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(4) Is it compulsory to merge Messenger with Skype?"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you,</span></p>
<p><span>Ivy Shelley</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ivy,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for the post on Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>As per the issue, when you are logged-in to the Skype account, you get notifications at the task bar for any message that you get on Windows Live Messenger or on the Hotmail account.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I would like to ask some questions in context on this issue:<br />
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Are you logged in to the Hotmail account or Windows Live messenger when you get such notification?<br />
<br />
<div>As per your questions, I would like to let you know that you won’t be able to check for the messages in the Hotmail inbox by clicking on the notification icon.<br />
<br />
<div>It is also not compulsory to merge Windows Live Messenger with Skype account as you can access and use then separately.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also Microsoft using live chat in Australia. You can refer to the link to do so:<br />
<br />
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ln=en-au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ln=en-au</a>
<br />
<div><br />
You can also post the query on Skype community forum for further assistance. You can refer to the
<div>link to do so:<br />

            1-No email notification is going away in both Hotmail and Skype when messenger does.<br />
<br />
2-AFAIK, no<br />
<br />
3-You can create a shortcut to pin anywhere you like to get you into Hotmail<br />
<br />
4-Messenger is being retired.&nbsp; March 15th it is gone.&nbsp; If you dont use instant messages your hotmail will continue to function either way/.<br />
<br />
Ivy, if you have more Hotmail (or email in general) questions you will get more attention if you ask them in the Hotmail section.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for&nbsp;your reply and answers! Yes, I am logged into Messenger when I &nbsp;get the notifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 even though it has au at the end. (Perhaps they do for sales only)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the other Spype link. I will try that.</p>
