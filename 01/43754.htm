    <title>System restore problem Oblivion save games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leib&#228;kki  say:</h3>
<h2>            System restore problem Oblivion save games</h2>
                    So about a month ago I deleted some files that i thought were useless. Well after I've deleted some files and I tried to start Oblivion it said something like this: "bink32 missing" or something like that, so I took my save games and made copies of them
 and uninstalled the game then I installed it back again, I placed the save games in the right folder, this time the game worked fine, but when I tried to load my newest save, the game said this: "something might be missing" or something like that and then
 it asked if I wanted to continue and I clicked ok. The game started to load the save, but everytime I tried to load it the game crashed. Few older saves worked fine, but I really like to get the newest one back. So took me about a month to get process on the
 problem, I asked my friend that what should I do, and he said I should try to use System Restore, well I got very happy about this, but when I tried to use it, I realized that it would only restore like two weeks back, and the uninstalling happened like a
 month ago, so im asking what to do and how to get my saves back. Thank you and sorry if my English was not that great, it's not my native language.<br />

            Hi leibakki,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
I can offer you some advise on a possible solution but this is outside of the scope for our support forum.&nbsp; We can assist you if you having trouble with game play in Vista but not recovery saved game files.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's something you might want to try, keep in mind System Restore will only restore system files.&nbsp; Any other files will NOT be affect so most likely your saved game won't come back either.&nbsp; If you can, locate the saved game file in its folder, try Right Click
 on the file and select Previous Version tab.&nbsp; If there's dates listed you can revert the file back to the date you choose and hopefully that will allow you to load your game.&nbsp; Sorry we are unable to assist you much with the problem but I hope that help.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that work,

            <p>Thanks for volunteering to help me. However, it is absolutely ridiculous and pathetic. As I said before, Microsoft is using ordinary people as Gini pigs to test their products.
 When those gone wrong, the customer have to do the work !!! <span>&nbsp;</span>I have paid the money and bought a genuine product and as an ordinary customer, I expect it to work reasonably without any issues. This is a Widows issue. Now the Billionaire
 Mr. Gates is trying to fix his problems on our expense. Also, I want to know, whether you have a complaints line, because If we cannot resolve this I want to take this to the ombudsman in UK.</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>

            Thanks for helping me. However, Mr. Bill Gate’s product is an utter **** and his Customer service is poorer than the poorest British company. In that sense, really appreciate your help. Why couldn't he set up a proper customer service department? Anyway, I have done all you said. Now I am getting an interesting response from Bill Gates. Whenever I try to update windows it says “Restart your computer to install updates - Windows cant update important files and services while system is using them. Save any open files and re-start the computer, and then check for newer updates”. Wow- we are back to square one, I think. Please advice.

<h2>            live photo gallery keeps crashing</h2>
                    <p>photo gallery keeps 'encountering a problem' it then either restarts or closes and I am rapidly losing the will...</p>
<p>I went to through to a technician 7 times yesterday through live help, the first &nbsp;disappeared, the 2nd remotely controlled my laptop told me it was doing a scan would restart and be cured - the scan found no errors didnt restart and I lost the technician
 as a result. The third remotely accessed my laptop and restarted it in 'safe mode without networking' and with no warning - it took me 30 mins to find out how to restart normally. I lost him as a result too. The next 3 'lost the connection' and the 4th I ended
 myself, by then I had been messing with it for over 5 hours. Today I tried again, the first technician said my notes said the problem had been resolved and promptly ended the chat, the second told me to reset my laptop and reboot windows 10 from a usb, i tried
 to perform the reset twice but there was an error and it didn't work.</p>
<p>Can somebody please help??? my issues only started after changing to windows 10</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know the Windows Essentials Edition installed on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;third party security software (if any installed) and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;Please turn the firewall back on. Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>
R</strong> keys from the Keyboard to open the <strong>Run</strong> window.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the text box and click on
<strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the
<strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the
<strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Close <strong>Task Manager.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the
<strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting</strong> with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue from the below
 article. Follow the above step 1 and step 2 to open the <strong>System configuration</strong> window.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>

</p><p><strong>You HAVE to save them on extern harddisk and USB-stick</strong>!!! If now something went wrong... If tags and albums is something, I GUESS you made in Photo Gallery, perhaps, you have to do this again, but the photos in your Pictures-folder, you
 will not lose. But I insist, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you <strong>

    <title>How to disable roaming profile in Windows 7 on a standalone machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karim2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable roaming profile in Windows 7 on a standalone machine</h2>
                    <strong>I have a very simple question. What would cause a standalone machine running Windows 7 to act like it's on a domain ?&nbsp; I also would like to ask: What is the purpose of the Roaming directory in Windows 7?</strong>
<br />
<br />
Also I would like to comment on the last post I made about the ROOTKIT I found on my machine.&nbsp; The root kit has been removed.&nbsp; What bothers me is that there is a lot of expertise and knowledgeable people on this forum and NO ONE could answer that question ?&nbsp;
 47 people viewed the post and NOT ONE ANSWER ? Not an even an attempt ?

<p>Ja wie die Meldung schon sagt dein NAT ist auf strikt und daher wirst du aus der Spielersuche geblockt. Je nach Router und Anbieter musst du da verschieden vorgehen. Entweder benutze die Bing Suche um dein Problem zu lösen oder aber rufe bei deinem Internet
 Anbieter an und frage dort nach.</p>

<h2>            Low Screen Resolution upon startup</h2>
                    I have a new Compaq Laptop with Vista Basic loaded.&nbsp; Why does my screen revert to low resolution when I boot up.&nbsp; I checked the settings; they're okay I think.&nbsp; I downloaded the latest NVIDIA driver for my Presario and, after the hour glass hovers a moment,
 low resolution still returns.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

            Zinco, thanks for responding but I already downloaded the latest driver for NVIDIA.&nbsp; What was wrong was far more basic I discovered.&nbsp; After clearing out my start-up file, my computer had enough memory to execute full resolution.&nbsp; The reason why the screen
 wound up displaying low resolution after start-up was caused by lack of memory.&nbsp; I haven't had the problem since cleaning up my start-up configuration.<br />

    <title>Windows 8 Screen on Windows 10 Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekprice50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Screen on Windows 10 Startup</h2>
                    When my laptop starts up the first screen shown is an old Windows 8 screen even though I am using Windows 10. My other laptop doesn't display the same issue. The laptop in question used to have a local account. I did this so I could change the Microsoft
 account I was using. When I reverted back to a Microsoft account I still got the local account screen before it gave me the Microsoft account screen. If someone knows how to correct this; I would be grateful.

            I rebuilt my PC using Windows 8 Pro disk and after loading Windows 10 I still have the Windows 8 screen coming up. I have put it down to using a disk to get Windows 8 instead of having it loaded as my operating system. The reason I'm assuming this is because
 my other laptop which was preloaded with Windows 8 doesn't have the same issue. Thank you for your help.

I use Microsoft Photo Editor to edit text scanned into Word as a jpeg. Now the program will not work on Windows 7 although the rest of Office 2000 is fine. Is there any comparable program that will allow me to cut and copy individual letters so easily, while
 still being able to move the document back and forth from Word?

<p>Hey Gledog,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>to answer your question, Xbox One doesn't support external storage's. What is possible is using your PC and pushing the information through via Media. You cant unfortunately search files on the Xbox One console but you can send it though your PC.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach back if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no external storage options on the Xbox One, and to be honest, I doubt that they'll support NAS for things like games etc. The only way you can play media from a NAS at the moment, as TheNinjaJedi has suggested, is to find a way to use
 PlayTo to send it to the Xbox, as this is supported.</p>

<h2>            Free Full Version Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have one question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got free full version of Windows 10 by upgrading it from my Licensed Windows 8. My Windows 8 key is built in my device and is embedded into BIOS. I upgraded to Windows 10 while it is still free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I want to re-install my OS, or let say another things happen to my device(e.g crashed, broken harddisk, etc), and I want to re-install it, I will automatically get my licensed Windows 8 back because it's embedded into BIOS, but how do I get back my free
 full version of Windows 10 now?</p>

<span><span><span><span><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened
 is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

<p>
</p><p>I will give you a short answer, when you do a clean install of Windows 10 on the same PC that you upgraded from Windows 8 to windows 10 after connecting it&nbsp;to the internet automatically getting activate with digital signature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can link your licenses to your Microsoft account by login with Microsoft account.

<h2>            When hovering mouse icons and text enlarge and keyboard does not display fonts</h2>
                    <p>My husband bought me a new HP laptop that has Windows 10. Can I say how much I hate windows 10!?! Oh my gosh!!&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how I can change the font /text size and icon size have it where it will stay the way I change it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and just moving
 my mouse pointer on the screen will cause the icons to grow extremely large or to the size of a pencil head!! What the heck?&nbsp; I want them set one way and I do not want things to "zoom in or out" just because my mouse is hovering over something. Its so frustrating.
 Plus this new HP has a lag time when using the keyboard. Why is that? I always end up hitting the backspace or delete key too many times because it lags so, Honestly , I am really not a complainer or adverse to learning something new, but this is really has
 me about ready to throw my laptop out the window.</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we apologize for the inconvenience caused for the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below;</p>
<p>Did the&nbsp;PC come preinstalled with Windows 10 when you purchased it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that&nbsp;you follow the methods below which will help us narrow down the cause&nbsp;of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Disable Zoom feature from touchpad.</strong></p>
<p>Go into your control panel select Hardware and Sound, go into Devices and Printers and select "Mouse". It should be right under the heading Devices and Printers. Select Device settings on the right hand side at the top then select "Settings" which is down
 below that on the right side of the box. After you click on that there will be a list of options on the left hand side. Select "Pinch zoom", uncheck the "enable pinch zoom" box and click apply at the bottom, then click ok. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Devices.</strong></p>
<p>Try connecting a wired mouse and keyboard to the PC&nbsp;and check if the issue replicates when&nbsp;connected via the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: User Account.</strong></p>
<p>Create or sign-in another user account and check if the issue replicates in that account as well. This will help us know if the issue is account or system specific. To learn how to create a new user account click on the link below</p>

<h2>            Windows detecting wrong monitor, LGM198WA instead of LG M208WA.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have had a LG M208WA monitor for quite some time now and it worked fine, however recently it stopped working, it was still under warranty so I got it replaced. Today the replacement came, same model, but now Windows seems to think it's an LG M198WA instead.</p>
<p>This is causing problems as it now thinks my screen's resolution should be 1440x900, instead of 1680x1050.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried going to the device manager and installing the drivers for the M208WA, it installed just fine, but even after restarting when going to the Screen Resolution options, it still says it's an M198WA - Device Manager will still say it's M208WA, and when
 I click advanced settings in the Screen Resolution bit it also says it's M208WA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I should add: I'm using a nVidia GTX260, Driver Version: 195.62 from nVidia's website. I've tried totally uninstalling and reinstalling both my monitor and graphics card drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annoying thing is, this isn't happening at all on my other monitor (Some Dell one, I don't even know the model number, but it at least displays right).</p>
<p>Any help would be great, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            After trying several things, including reinstalling windows live mail, I finally hit upon the magic combination.&nbsp; It required the incoming mail POP3 server to use SSL and port 995 along with the outgoing SMTP server using SSL and port 25.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after
 most of the day spent troubleshooting, the problem is resolved!

<h2>            Skype for Business - HD and subscription time</h2>
                    
<p>I am considering buying Skype for business to get HD quality in video calls.</p>

<p>In a conversation of two people, do both need Skype for business to get HD quality for both?</p>
<p>Or is it enough with just one person in a conversation having Skype for business?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is one year the minimum subscription time one can sign up for?</p>
<p>Or is it possible to just sign up for a few months at a time?</p>

<p>Hi User73446,</p>
<p>Regarding “do both need Skype for Business to get HD quality for both”, yes, both of the 2 people need Skype for Business Online Plan 2 or other kinds of Office 365 Business plans.</p>
<p>Please note: According to the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/skype-for-business-online-service-description.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business online service description</a>, Skype for Business Online Plan 1, Office 365 Enterprise K1 and Office 365 Government K1 plan don’t support High Definition video calls. So, if you want to enjoy the Skype for Business High Definition video
 call feature, please don’t purchase these 3 plans.</p>
<p>About “Is one year the minimum subscription time one can sign up for”, no, you can purchase Office 365 Business plans or Skype for Business standalone plans for a few months at a time. You can choose paying the Office 365 subscriptions monthly or yearly.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Purchase Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbinnny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchase Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center Key</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop that came with Windows 8. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 8.1 without problem. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had to bring it to someone to repair a physical issue with the laptop hinge. &nbsp;Nothing out of the ordinary. &nbsp;The vendor asked if I wanted to upgrade to 8.1 Pro with Media Center, quoted a price, and I agreed. &nbsp;After receiving the laptop, I noticed that it
 had Win 8.1 Pro w/MC, but that it was not a legal copy, and I was asked for an Activation Key.<br />
<br />
I have already resolved the appropriate steps legally to address the actions of the vendor. &nbsp;Now, however, I am stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. &nbsp;Restore Windows 8 from the recovery partition on my laptop. &nbsp;I am told, however, that this would erase my C drive, and unfortunately, I cannot backup the contents of the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. &nbsp;Legally acquire a Win 8.1 Pro w/MC activation key. &nbsp;I am located in the United States, and I don't know if a Win 8.1 Pro key will suffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please offer me guidance and direction on how to accomplish either Option A, above, without erasing my C drive. &nbsp;Or Option B, above, with where I can legally purchase the keys I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Cannot find Folders for DLNA Content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeldeslippe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find Folders for DLNA Content</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find content on Windows (any version) when acting as a DLNA server (Media Server). All devices recognize my PCs, and they recognize them when I am using Windows 7 Ultimate x64, Windows 8.1 x64 and Windows 10 Preview x86. All PCs, regardless of operating
 system show up on my network and can be seen by all devices from my PC to Android phones and Tablets, to TVs and Blu-Ray players. Everything finds the servers on every PC. However, there is NEVER any content in any folder. I can select video, audio or image
 and look in video, audio and/or image folders. I have looked in libraries, personal folders, public folders and created folders. I have placed specially named MP4 video files in every folder I can find so if anything turns up I'll know exactly which folder
 shows up where. I have streaming turned on in Media Player. I have the Media Center editions for all OS's. All OS's can find and play DLNA streamed from my NAS server (which is running some flavor of *nix on an Intel Atom processor). Even skipping connectivity
 problems, on any given PC, I can fire up Windows Media Player and see it is serving up my PC name with (Digital Media Server) after the name, it has subfolders of Music, Videos, Pictures and Recorded TV, but even on the very PC serving up the content, nothing
 shows in any of the folders. Homegroup is turned on, all folders are read/write accessible. I can see all my other PCs on the Homegroup. Apart from trying to access them as a media server, I can access any other PC with Windows Explorer, including the video,
 music and picture directories and play, download or move files between PCs. The only thing I cannot do is get files to show up for serving through the DLNA connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help! I know someone will say "click this block" and everything will be fine, but I cannot find the answer anywhere. I have read and tried every question I could find on MSDN, technet and these social forums. Everything indicates this should be working and,
 as an absolute minimum, should show up on the PC doing the serving, but I find nothing. I can only conclude I'm looking in the wrong folders for the information and I cannot find the right ones. I have used "Search" to find every folder called Video, Music
 or Pictures and made sure there are playable files in them, but none show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Organize, "Manage Libraries", all the folders I expect to be listed are listed in "Video Library Locations" Under Other libraries, I can see files in three NAS servers and two android devices including my phone. However, four PCs are listed and they
 all come back empty in every category. Why, why, why is nothing showing up? Why do the PCs seem to be broadcasting their availability, but have no content to share?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide,</p>
<p>
</p><p>---Mike</p>

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that that you are trying to share files by creating DLNA server on his Windows media player and you are unable to see the files on other computer though it gets connected to the server without any problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could be caused if Internet Protocol security (IPsec) is enabled on the computer. W</span><span>e won't be able to use the media sharing feature if Internet Protocol security (IPsec) is enabled on the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Media Player has an option under “Stream” to “Automatically allow devices to play my media” which has the same effect. You have to be careful if you decide to use this
 option on a laptop computer that you use outside the home.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important: To Set Up the DLNA Media Client in Windows Media Player.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You need to make sure that the player PC is on the same network as the media server. Now if you go to another Windows PC and call up Windows Media Player, you should be able to see, in the left column, under “Other Libraries”, the
 shared Library that you just set up. You may have to right click “Other Libraries” and select “Refresh” if you don’t see the content right away.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can control what gets shared in Windows Media Player under “Organize”, “Manage Libraries”, and “Pictures”. You can remove the “My Pictures” Folder from the list, or specify a different folder.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 8 DLNA Media Server does not have any access control. It has no logins and no permissions.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So whatever you make available through your DLNA server is visible to everyone. It is best to use the Media Streaming Options screen to control who you want to share with if you plan on using that computer outside the home.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please check the <strong>Internet Protocol security settings</strong>, as it must be set to Automatic so change the same
<strong>manually</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To change the IPS settings, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> key type control and click <strong>
Ok</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Network and sharing center</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>internet access type</strong> then go to <strong>properties.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Internet protocol version 4</strong> then click on <strong>
properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Change the <strong>IPS settings manually</strong> and <strong>save it.</strong></span></li><li><strong><span>Restart </span></strong><span>the computer and test the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please contact us if you need any further assistance using your Windows.</span></p>
