            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death) when you access a particular application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system goes to a Blue Screen Of Death because there are some exceptions happened in the kernel (a device drivers, backup software or anti-virus services, etc.), and Windows
 implements this mechanism: When it detects some errors occur in the kernel, it will kill the box in case some more severe damage happens. Then we get a blue screen or the system reboots (it depends on what the system settings are).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL dd {margin-bottom:0em; margin-left:1.9em; }.divclass {behavior:url(#default#savehistory);}</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Cause</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool
 that is incompatible with the new version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>I'd suggest you follow these steps.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Disconnect any external devices and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd also suggest you to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update</a> the Chipset drivers from the manufacturer's

<h2>            Accidentally deleted the wrong temp files and windows won&#39;t start- had to reinstall, but cannot re-use the activation key</h2>
                    I was dumb and was blindly deleting what I thought was garbage on my computer.&nbsp; I emptied the TEMP folder (rather than the temp folder) and my computer would no longer boot up.&nbsp; I tried desperately to fix this, but nothing worked (not even system restore).&nbsp;
 So, I installed Windows 7 again (another bone head move) and figured I would just copy everything over.&nbsp; I did not think about the fact that I cannot use my activation key again, even though the original Windows 7 is still on the computer, but rendered useless.&nbsp;
 What do I do?

<p>I'd suggest going to the Control Panel and open Mouse, check to see what is assigned as functions for your mouse.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba laptop won&#8217;t boot.</h2>
                    <p>toshiba X75 laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wont boot. Black screen. From reading around i have a problem where i have no post. It was intermittently not booting until it doesnt now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed HD, RAM, dvd drive, wifi adapter.. still no boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all the tricks with taking battery out, holding power button, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried warming up the case really hot with a hairdryer. Was consideri putting it in the fridge to see if the opposite is my issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im narrowing it down to motherboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes i get a fan, most times i dont. If i get a fan it will boot, every now and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other way to diagnose motherboard? I dont have an external monitor, but conisdering that sometimes it boots up fine im taking the monitor to be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just practically taken the motherboard out to get the serial number, sonim happy to swap it, if i can get a confirmation its that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly after i took a lot of bits off it and started it offered me f2 to get to bios. Did that. Reset system time, booted. Now wont again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i test the power supply brick is functioning properly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mouse Freezes Up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft Surface Computer and over the past two weeks, many times my mouse has "frozen up" on me and I cannot move the pointer at all.&nbsp; I have tried changing the default buttons, batteries, etc. on the mouse to no avail - so I bought a new
 mouse!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing keeps happening with the new mouse and the only remedy for this is to power the Surface unit down using the RHS button and then power it back up using the same button.&nbsp; Then the mouse starts working again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an odd and irritating problem.&nbsp; I have also checked the Bluetooth connection and everything seems to be okay there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what might be causing this and how to resolve it?</p>

<p>Hi Tansukh, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be software or hardware driven. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit on your device. The toolkit runs through a series of tests to diagnose the hardware of your Surface device.
<span>The diagnosis and repair time averages 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer. To lean how to run the toolkit, click

<p>
</p><p>You may also try to start your device in safe mode and check if the issue occurs. On how to start your device in safe mode, click

<p>Hello and thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of Saturday (5/26/2018), we have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit --- it took approximately 15 minutes and showed no software/hardware problems.</li><li>The new keyboard did not help</li><li>The new mouse has not helped.</li><li>Fresh set of batteries were installed in the mouse/keyboard.</li></ul>
<p>The problem still persists and when we hit the RHS bottom power button momentarily without actually restarting, the mouse unfreezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On an average basis, this happens about 18-20 times per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please guide us as to what our next steps should be.</p>

<p>Hi Tansukh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing more information about the issue. I understand the troubleshooting you have performed so far has not resolved the problem. I suggest that you try a two-button reset since we are looking at a possible software issue. This process will
 reload the drivers on your Surface to make sure all software packages are running properly. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>While the device is off, press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds. It will enter the UEFI. Wait until the screen goes off before releasing both buttons.</li><li>Switch on your Surface normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us. This is quite odd. We would like to know more about this matter. Can you tell us the make and model of your wireless mouse and keyboard? Does it have the same frequency as the Surface Pro? Can you confirm if there are no devices
 interfering with the Bluetooth connection? <br />
<br />
Have you tried using the Bluetooth troubleshooter? If you haven't, go to <strong>
Start</strong> () button &gt;
<strong>Settings </strong>() &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. Then under the '<em><strong>Find and fix other problems</strong></em>', select
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> then click <strong>'Run the troubleshooter'</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Joesph Agu,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>We bought the Microsoft Surface Unit along with the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse in December 2016.</li><li>Wireless connectivity has never given us any trouble until about eight [8] weeks ago.</li><li>No other Bluetooth modifications / connections have been made that would interfere with the connectivity.</li><li>Wireless mouse does not have a model number, neither does the keyboard.</li><li>We tried to replace the batteries within the mouse and the keyboard --- that did not fix it.</li><li>Therefore, we purchased a new Microsoft Wireless mouse and also a keyboard --- and paired both of them.&nbsp; That did not work.</li><li>We have installed the latest drivers --- still the mouse freezes up!</li><li>We have done the aforesaid Bluetooth troubleshooter multiple times and it has not fixed the problem.</li><li>Our next steps are to go to wired keyboard and wired mouse (which is regressive).</li><li>The costs are not an issue but we are sure that we explore each avenue before using the wired materials
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Your suggest didn't work. Already done now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's all my attempts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Turn off Xbox360 and Router for few minutes and restart all</p>
<p>2- Opened the ports suggest by Support (3074, 80, 88, 53 all TCP/UDP)</p>
<p>3- Connecte with wireless, then with cable</p>
<p>4- Searching on internet that kind of errror and made several attemptes suggested.</p>
<p>5- Empty Cache</p>
<p>6- UPNP Is enabled and NAT is opened</p>
<p>7- Restore router and xbox360 to factory settings</p>
<p>8- Turn DMZ </p>
<p>9- Disabling firewall</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. If your console had been banned you would've received an error message saying that the device is banned. Try some of the steps listed within this helpful support article:

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't get 1 month of Xbox Live Gold free when signing up for an Xbox Live account. You automatically get connected to Xbox Live servers with an Xbox Live Silver account, but you need an Xbox Live Gold subscription to play any game online. This is a requirement
 and is probably the main reason why you are getting that error when trying to play online. Your network seems like it is good for online play and you have done the troubleshooting but you won't get online without that subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New accounts generally always have deals when getting Xbox Live Gold for the first time, but it does vary by region. I recommend checking out the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/xbox-live-gold/cfq7ttc0k5dj?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Gold</a> site and login with your new account to see what offers it gives you. Also you can redeem
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/rewards?rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Rewards</a> for subscriptions if you have enough points.</p>

            Hi Robin, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for pointing me to the Windows Central page about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I have spent about 2 hours in total going through this process! I got to "How to Install a Windows 10 update from a flash drive" step 5 when Windows told me 'More space needed for update' 2.68 Gb needed on the C drive and you're OK on Part B external
 storage because you plugged in the 2nd USB. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm back to my original problem of only having about 1.68 Gb left on my C drive because Windows doesn't show me the message 'Choose another drive or attach an external drive with 10 GB available so I get stuck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be 75% of the way there but it is very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robin</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your advice. As you can see from my feedback to Sarah below, I've tried the Windows Central steps but got stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I've done what you suggested but I have used the Media Creation Tool and downloaded the latest version of Windows 10 to a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the steps in the Windows Central page Sarah pointed me to, I still have the 'not enough space on the C drive' message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to make my tablet (Viglen Intel Atom 1.33 GHz) give me access to the BIOS. It should do with f7 but it doesn't do anything. I've put the 'Windows 10 Upgrade' USB in my USB port and restarted my tablet. It does use the USB and launches Windows
 Setup. Then I get a message on the screen </p>
<p>
</p><p>["The upgrade option isn't available using Windows installation media."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a copy of Windows is already installed on this computer and you want to upgrade, remove the installation media and restart your computer. After Windows has started normally, insert the installation media and run Windows"]</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the screen I have a green, horizontal thermometer with '1 Collecting information' and '2 Installing Windows' . The green bar flashes but seems to be stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing the right thing? Does it take minutes or hours or has it got stuck?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your feedback.</p>
<p>Robin</p>

            The fact is: a 32GB hard drive is simply too small for Windows 10. Even if you are somehow able to install v.1803, there are new feature updates twice a year, so it's just a matter of time before you'll be out of space.

<h2>            How to change the border size of a window&#63;</h2>
                    As I know, window's border is system defined. Is it possible to change the border width using win32 sdk? Just like visual studio's very thin border.

            You can open your window color settings and change the border padding property to 1 (Windows 7 by default makes it 4 I think) and it will make the borders much thinner.

    <title>Cannot find program to uninstall it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wsbb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find program to uninstall it</h2>
                    <p>It looks like I installed Firefox twice, I can see it on the Applications list on the left (Windows 10). And I found two install .exe in downloads, which have now been deleted (limited room on my SSD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled one of the Firefox programs which worked. (It was in Programs folder.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to uninstall the second one. In the System prefs, Applications I cannot find (using Search field) Firefox. It does not list. Right-clicking it in the Program list (on left) shows Uninstall, but when the folder opens, it does not show it.</p>
<p>I have looked in Programs and Programs (x86). Not there. It must be somewhere because I can open it from the Programs list on left or from the shortcut on the Desktop.</p>
<p>I have also tried the Windows search on the Taskbar looking for Firefox, it says it is a Desktop app. Does this mean it is somehow on the Desktop instead of programs folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you Mark.</p>
<p>Before doing this, I eventually found the exe program in App Data (which I worked out is a hidden folder) which is presumably why it did not show in Programs folder nor in the App list in Settings and why I could not find it by doing a general search (because
 Hidden files in File explorer was turned off).</p>
<p>I used their installer to install, and for some reason it was put there. I don't know enough to be able to direct an application install into a hidden folder but that is what must have happened.</p>

            <p>EDGE has its own Settings options, i.e. completely separate from IE and you can clean the cached files separately (just as most users clean the IE files within it's internal settings options):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Edge and click of the 3 Dots near the top Right-Hand Corner; Then Select "Choose what to clear", Make your selections and Press the "Clear" Button</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use EDGE then change your Default Browser to IE11 through Settings - System - Default apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup doesn't have any options to clear EDGE's cached files etc. at present, probably because it is still an evolving application.</p>

            I must leave a positive note though, I do find Windows 10 a good OS, my laptop starts and finishes quicker and I haven't had any other problem with it apart from the aforementioned.

            <p>I have done all of the options given by Microsoft to try and utilize Disk CleanUp to not avail, nothing has helped. I don't understand why a company that can create the program cannot fix it when it is obviously having issues. I personally have no idea,
 have been using Microsoft for over 30 years, I have faith that someone will find an answer and will keep checking back.</p>

            Hi DJ,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot to the Login Screen correctly . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            Sometimes, Windows 10 does cause this issue. 
<br />
<br />1. Try to boot through USB
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If nothing works, I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi,<br />
<br />

================================<br />
<br />
If no joy update your Video/Display driver using these methods.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load
<br />
address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the
<br />
driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest
<br />
versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while
<br />
there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in
<br />
Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers
<br />
which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then
<br />
HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>nVidia Driver Update&#58; &#34;Invalid access to memory location&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sudrobrown ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            nVidia Driver Update&#58; &#34;Invalid access to memory location&#34; error</h2>
                    Recently, I noticed that nVidia had updated drivers for my GeForce 440. When I tried to install, I received an "Invalid access to memory location" error and the install failed. I figured I still had functional drivers, so I'd figure it out later.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Three nights ago, Windows Update took it upon itself to attempt the update for me. It uninstalled the existing driver successfully (which I'd failed to do because of the error noted above), but also failed the install. Subsequent manual attempts to install
 have also failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Looking at the Control Panel Programs and Features window reveals that older drivers appear to be installed, but are not functioning. Attempts to uninstall them also fail, with the same error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because I reinstalled Vista over the summer and haven't made any significant changes since, I don't have a system restore point. Careless of me, I know, but there it is.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to fix this problem short of once again reinstalling Vista or should I resign myself to another day and a half of reupdates?</div>
                </div>

<h3> jaetejou2  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer.exe 0xc0000006 error</h2>
                    <p>When booting into Windows 7, I get this error: "explorer.exe: The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000006)."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No recent software changes, but some recent Windows updates. I can open Task Manager, but running explorer as a new task fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Debian on a second partition (installed months ago, with no problems) -- working fine, and can access all files on Windows partitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory check shows no errors. Have tried SFC ("Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation" at 17%). Startup repair with Windows CD also fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I have not made any hardware changes recently (haven't changed anything since buying the laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer boots into safe mode, but I get the same error when trying to run explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booting into safe mode with cmd line then running explorer.exe produces same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore does not appear to work -- I've left it running for a day and a half with no apparent progress.</p>

<p>That would be the issue then</p>
<p>Locale is not your account location</p>
<p>Thats your regional settings on your console</p>
<p>To play xbox 360 games yoir account region</p>
<p>Actual region and language must match</p>

<h2>            Serious issue with KB4058043 - PC inoperable after installing update</h2>
                    <p><strong>Question:&nbsp; </strong>Is there a way to check compatibility of a Win 10 update before actually installing it on a computer?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">HP Pavillion dv6 A5F76AV Laptop with an x64 based i7 processor 16 GB of RAM - Win 10 installed KB4058043 automatically and a message popped up that it needed to restart to finish updating drivers.&nbsp; During restart the screen went
 to a Blue Screen with a frowny face&nbsp; : (&nbsp; which is NO CONSOLATION for locking me out of my computer.&nbsp; Although the screen message stated that I could restart my computer, there were no button options to do that so I had to shut down the computer and restart
 it with the power button to no avail.&nbsp; Same screen popped up.&nbsp; Bottom line is this update hosed my computer, Win 10 Repair Disc couldn't do anything and MS Tech's solution was that my PC is not compatible with this new update and we need to turn off updates
 from this point forward and re-install Win 10 offline with an older build which he prepared for me on one of my external USB HD.&nbsp; I had to even go through the boot up options and system options to re-enable boot up from CD/DVD, my PC refused to recognize my
 Emergency Repair Disc from a 3rd Party which eventually I managed to get working after re-enabling the CD/DVD drive several times.&nbsp; After about 6 hours, I was able to access the 3rd Party Backup tool and restore an earlier image (1 month old) and then restore
 backups to within a week of this failed update; luckily I was on vacation the previous week so lost very little actual work (worked 1 day on vacation).&nbsp; Win10 auto update caused endless and needless frustration (why not run a compatibility check before pushing
 your updates).&nbsp; Thank GOD I had images and backups or I would have lost my programs and files.&nbsp; I have increased my image frequency.&nbsp; Backups are always on so, as long as I am home, they get backed up contemporaneously.

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot your device after installing an update, it could be that a component of Windows may have been damaged or corrupted. We recommend that you download and use an installation media to restore from a system restore point or reset your
 PC. Here's how to download and use an installation media:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <em><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft software download website</a></em>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select <strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create the installation media, and then select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and your other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you are not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select Repair your computer.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option </strong>screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you may:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting <strong>Advanced options </strong>
&gt; <strong>System Restore</strong>. This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might be causing your PC problems. Restoring from a system restore point won't affect your personal files.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset this PC </strong>to reinstall Windows 10. This will remove apps and drivers you installed and changes you made to settings, but lets you choose to keep or remove your personal files.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering the ultimate question.&nbsp; I did find the Update Catalog, but thank you for providing the link.&nbsp; Since there is presently no way to check compatibility with Microsoft Win 10 updates prior to installation, my solution is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable Win10 Updates through services.msc (look up Windows Updates, double click on it and select Disable in the "startup type" option - dropdown list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Enable Easeus Todo Backup to do a PreOS load so my PC boots up with the option to load Easeus Todo Backup and thereby provide me with the option to restore an Image prior to loading Win10 and crashing my PC. This avoids the problem I had with accessing
 the DVD drive also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Search on <strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4058258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog website</a></strong> for any updates that have not been installed.&nbsp; Download any updates not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Make an image prior to installing any Win10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Install the updates one at a time and attempt to restart into the updated Win10 OS after each successful installation.&nbsp; If it fails, I can reboot and choose Easeus Todo Backup instead of Win10 and restore my previous image and try the next update and
 repeat the process until all compatible updates have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only until Microsoft comes up with a better way to check compatibility before installing damaging updates.&nbsp; Thank you for responding.</p>

    <title>Background Info in Skyrim&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smokey2grenade3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Background Info in Skyrim&#63;</h2>
                    Just wondering from some of those who have experience with past ES tittles. Would Skyrim include information ( thru books and other items) about past Elder Scrolls and if this is the first ES game you have played, fill you in on what you need? Even tho
 this story is in it's own, there will no doubt be times where extra knowledge will be nice. (example: new vegas was its own game, but having played fallout3 there were alot of times something was said or mentioned that made me laugh or gave me extra knowledge)

<p>Maybe a few things, but since the games are all so far apart in lore (years wise), I doubt that there will be much. I think that the appeal to playing previous installments would be to see how the lore of the world has moved forward.</p>

<p>Yep. Daggerfall called back to Arena a few times (but mostly expanded on things introduced in Arena), Morrowind had a couple references to Daggerfall (a book on the Warp in the West for example), and Oblivion had a few references to Morrowind (a few returning
 NPCs, reference to the Nerevarine's and Vivec's disappearances, the Uderfyke). Skyrim will obviously be making a number of references to the two TES books that haven been released since Oblivion that have added in a lot of major events (Morrowind basically
 being completely screwed over, for example), and I'm sure there will be a bit more as well.</p>

<p>According to some thingamajiggy I read or watched from the hour impression someone read the lore hadn't moved forward at all. they read mostly the same books and whatnot. That was the reviewers only complaint, that it doesn't feel like 200 years have passed
 and the other games happened.</p>

<p>Well considering most of the books in Elder Scrolls where about historic events, it makes sense that they will remain as is. History doesn't change just because time moves on, same with novels. We still after all read Jane Austen, Shakespeare, etc so why
 wouldn't they still read their classics.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Really, he's complaint is "I walked around a very limited area of the game and only saw old books so therefore there is no new books" that is quite a conjecture on his part.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now that doesn't mean his is not correct, just that there are good reasons why Bethseda won't want to reveal the titles and contents of any new books until realease. So until we get a full book list, people shouldn't make such claims.&nbsp;

<p>The two main agruments I've heard about new/old books are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. (basically what starscream said) classics are carried over through generations and will continue to be read and seen as frequently as we see Shakespheare and ancient Mythology. The ratio between new and old cannot be measured accurately until release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You cannot compare the lfiespan of our culture's literature to TES since over a course of two hundred years we advance technologically and create better record keeping while the cultures in TES stay relatively the same. In other words, the older the books
 are in TES, the rarer they must become since copies may or may not continue to be produced and older copies become damaged or lost over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this game is going to lack something. If everything promised lives up to itself, then the devs&nbsp;focus on one element of the game has to be lacking. I have a feeling that's literature and lore.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So the old books should give you all the history you need to be fully immersed in the game?

<p>As with new books i hope.</p>

<p>Except based on the quality of the books and the fact that Cyrodiil could maintain a newspaper, we can say that they have the printing press or equivalent technology. Plus the fact that the books are so widespread mean literacy is high and the publishers
 have the ability to produce large quantities. So new versions of the old books should be constantly being printed, never allowing scenario two to occur.

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>An event 41 is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly. There may be insufficient information to explicitly define what happened. To determine what may have happened and to identify a potential
 resolution, it is important to know what the computer was doing at the time just before the event occurred.<br />
<br />
If event 41 is logged because power to the computer was interrupted, consider obtaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) such as a battery backup power supply. An underpowered or failing power supply may cause this behavior. For example, if you added RAM
 or additional devices or hard disks when this problem began, the power supply may cause the problem.</p>

            <p>Windows 7 has a built-in way of organizing your files and folders.&nbsp; It is the set of folders under your User identity.&nbsp; It may not be the design that you would prefer, but trying to do it another way is swimming up stream.&nbsp; The designers of Windows 7 had
 their vision of how to organize built in to the design of Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you create a folder for each of the groupings,&nbsp;INSIDE the folder for your User identity (C:/User/YOU)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Move the files and folders of each of those groupings into these new folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create one shortcut for each of those FOLDERS on your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your desktop will become uncluttered and you will have easy access to all your stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think of this as if you just received a five drawer metal filing cabinet.</p>

            <p>Yeah I don't really want to use folders (I *am* using them, but I don't *want* to). &nbsp;They're just not as intuitive for me, and I have to dig into that folder to see what's in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want something BETTER than folders.</p>
