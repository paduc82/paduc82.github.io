<h2>            Constant 30&#37; CPU usage in windows 7 when idle</h2>
                    Hello, I'm having a problem where windows utilizes 30% of CPU usage even when Idle.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem starts when i open a program like games or any intensive application that requires alot of CPU load. But after closing the program, i noticed in my taskbar that windows generates and continues to use up to 30% of CPU load on other applications
 for example Dwm.exe (desktop windows management) but if i stop DWN.exe from taskbar, another program or service will replace it and generates the same CPU load, if i stop that another will take its place like svchost or the taskbar.exe itself getting a 25
 to 27 cpu load. Its like an ongoing cycle or Loop of CPU usage, its supposed to stop after closing programs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I already have done steps i thought would clear this problem and these are:</div>
<div>Registry fix</div>
<div>ran Avast Anti-virus</div>
<div>reset BIOS</div>
<div>ran anti malware programs</div>
<div>ran Msconfig and disabled unwanted programs running on the background</div>
<div>ran windows 7 update</div>
<div>updated all my drivers</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Summary:</div>
<div>The problem still persist. This problem doesnt occur after boot, everything is fine with my system idle getting 97%. it only starts after i ran a program that utilizes high CPU load but after closing it, the heavy CPU load continues by replacing the closed
 program with another either dwm.exe,taskmanager.exe,svchost.exe..etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope somebody helps me resolve this problem, i greatly appreciate it. thank you</div>
<div><br />

            Hi, thanks for replying
<div><br />
<div>I have no 3rd party software running in the background,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2 reported no errors, However Method 3 worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seems that i may have installed something that created the problem. I also have some suspicion about deleted programs. I deleted some programs before without going through the uninstall process. I just deleted the folders. i think that may have contributed
 the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you have any advice how to clean completely these files that it may have left some mini programs that runs at certain point. I believe my CPU goes on a cycle running this programs but since i have deleted the main folder it goes into a loop finding
 it and perhaps triggers my cpu usage at 30% to occur continously. &nbsp;</div>

            A deleted program should not use the cpu, but will be left on the list in<br />
Programs and Features as well as potentially leaving registry entries and<br />
other folders somewhere in your User&nbsp; folder/sub-folders.<br />
This could cause problems if you try to reinstall that program again because <br />
of the registry entries, and maybe files like&nbsp; ini&nbsp; or cfg files in your User folder.<br />
<br />
A good look through your User \ My Documents and AppData folder may find <br />
something from these programs&nbsp; that you can delete.<br />
You can also check the registry manually.&nbsp; [Before deleting registry entries back<br />
up the registry by going to <span style="font-style: italic">File &gt; Export</span> ]<br />
Click on <span style="font-style: italic">Start</span> then the <span style="font-style: italic">
Run</span> command and type&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">regedit&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; into the box.<br />
When the registry opens look in <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE&nbsp; (&amp; WOW6432NODE) for entries <br />
that correspond to the deleted software and delete them.<br />
<br />
As you've made a new User account you may also want to look in<br />
HKEY_USERS \ then find your old user entries (if you have not deleted the old <br />
user account)&nbsp; in the numbered folders and go to SOFTWARE - etc. - and do as above.<br />
(Normally you would look in CURRENT_ USER if you are the only account holder).<br />
<br />
One possibility is maybe one of the deleted programs has a separate updater<br />
program installed in another folder that is trying to find an update for the deleted program, but this&nbsp; should show up via msconfig\Startup,&nbsp; if there is one.<br />
.<br />
<br />

            I tried looking at all possible leftover programs but to no avail.&nbsp;
<div>I already configured msconfig too to disable startup programs.</div>
<div>The problem is different. in a way that whenever the CPU fires up somehow by certain programs either games or image editing software..it goes under a heavy load, now if close that program it will find a Service in my taskbar to have the same CPU load...it
 could either pick DWM.exe or svchost.exe or anything. if i close that service thats been rev up in the taskbar usually getting 25-26 under CPU, it will find another service and replace it getting the same 25-26 under CPU usually it records &nbsp;30%-32%.
<div><br />
<div>And it goes constant like this even if no other programs are running in the background.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the only way i could stop this is reboot. and system is fine even if other programs are running getting only 6% load....except if open games or image editing software then the problem starts again.</div>

            As far as I see in my system, the reason is the MS Update Center service. Disabling it in services tab I have 0-1% CPU usage instead of 22-29% which I have on a system load. U can try this and even disable it permanently if it helps (ofc if u understand
 what r u doing :).

            <p>It sounds like your system is experiencing a known problem with Windows Update that is easy to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in Task Manager (Ctrl-Alt-Del) at the Processes tab with the "Show processes from all users" checked you would notice a svchost.exe Process that is running amok using too much of the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of disabling important Windows Services to fix the symptom of the problem why don't you fix the problem instead.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem and was at a loss about what caused it. I tried updating all drivers, running malware scans, and disabling background processes but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked was disabling possible problem devices from Device Manager, rebooting, and enabling them one-by-one and seeing if the problem came back. I used DPS Latency Checker in addition to Task Manager to detect if the problem returned. The culprit appears
 to have been bad drivers for&nbsp;<strong>VIA HD Audio&nbsp;</strong>which Windows 10 for some reason couldn't properly update before the device had been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was first&nbsp;<strong>disabling </strong>VIA HD Audio from Device Manager, then rebooting, going back to Device Manager, right-clicking VIA HD Audio and
<strong>updating its driver</strong><strong> without enabling the device first!</strong> While the device was disabled Windows 10 suddenly noticed the driver needed updating and installed the update, after which the device was renamed
<strong>VIA HD Audio(Win 10)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't had the problem since.</p>

            This is not about activation. This is about installing the OS.
<div>After the files are copied in the HDD, the instalation begins, and it asks for the key.</div>
<div>The code is visible (on the sticker) and written&nbsp;correctly, but it's says that is not, as if it was wrong.</div>

<li>Are you using the correct media. If your sticker is for XP Pro, you must use an XP Pro oem CD (or the manufacturer's recovery media).</li><li>Are you sure you are reading the key correctly, sometimes it is easy to mistake 8/B Y/T Y/V C/G. Try and imagine what letter it might be. It can't do any harm to keep trying until you get it right. Once you get it right I would suggest recording it for
 future occasions when it might be needed.

            <p>Just went through this with MS.&nbsp; At my client, we have probably 35 valid XP licenses that aren't being used.&nbsp; Because I don't have the EXACT disc to install my valid license, I can't.&nbsp; Went through about 1.5 hours with Microsoft to ultimately get a big FU.&nbsp;
 35 free licenses and their answer is to buy another?&nbsp; It's a freakin' valid license Microsoft and you aren't willing to recognize it.&nbsp; Well FU too!</p>

            Same thing with me. I have about 12 licences and I allways did the same thing when reinstalling the OS, but now it didn't worked.&nbsp;

<p>I got them as well when I was playing Black Ops so you're not alone. Not sure why it happens but I reckon having to juggle the various permutations of what the bots can carry in their loadout (guns, attachments, perks, killstreaks etc) can be taxing. I wouldn't
 worry about it.</p>

<p>You can try to delete/reinstall the game and any associated add-ons. You could also try clearing your system cache. Both of these process can be found in our sticky posts at the top of the forum.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which is the version of the Media Player installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you are trying to switch it to mini mode?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you receiving any error codes or messages?</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>To switch from full or skin mode to mini Player mode</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Mini Player mode allows you to minimize the Player to the Windows taskbar, while still having access to playback controls and the ability to view visualizations and information about the currently
 playing item.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Right-click an open area of the Windows taskbar (such as below the system clock), point to Toolbars, and then click Windows Media Player.
<br />
This turns on the feature and only needs to be performed once. A check mark appears next to Windows Media Player to indicate that it is turned on. To switch to mini Player mode in the future, simply click the Minimize button in the Player.

<p>I appreciate that you guys are all frustrated with Paypal, but just a general "Paypal isn't working" thread won't really help us narrow down causes and solutions. I recommend checking out the new Paypal Sticky (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/t/26156.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../26156.aspx</a>)
 and if you are still having an issue, create a specific post about your issue. Please try to stay away from "I have the exact same issue (except it's not)" posts. Thanks!</p>

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />

Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<h2>            Unbale to use Windows optical mouse, error code&#58; 28</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Microsoft basic optical mouse. I plugged it into myu computer but the icon informed me that it failed to install device drivers. i've tried reinstalling Intellipoint 8.2 and the Microsoft mouse and keyboard center. Done all of the windows
 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bring up the device manager it beings up an errror:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
<br />
Access is denied.<br />
<br />
<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the only administrator account on my computer, &nbsp;(It is also the only account).<br />
I've tried editing permissions in the registry but I can't seem to find the right one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience that you have to go through due to this Microsoft basic optical mouse issue. Letâs work together to get this problem resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What is the model number of the Windows mouse?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you receive error codes 28 &amp; 31 in the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong> then they indicate that the drivers for this device are not installed or corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to take the full control permission of the USB store through Registry Editor and then try to uninstall and reinstall the USB drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Take the full control permission of the USB store through Registry Editor.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Right click</strong> on the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<strong>USBSTOR</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click on â<strong>Permissions</strong>â on the right click menu. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click on â<strong>Add</strong>â tab. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Type <strong>Everyone</strong> under <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong> and click on
<strong>Check Names. Everyone </strong>would be underlined. Click <strong>Ok.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Choose <strong>Everyone</strong> from <strong>Groups or User names</strong> and put a
<strong>check mark</strong> on <strong>Full Control - Allow. </strong>Click <strong>
OK</strong> and <strong>restart the computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important this section,</em></strong><em> method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in
 the Microsoft Knowledge Base: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</a></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller
</span></strong><span>and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller from device manager.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><strong>Note:</strong> You may&nbsp;un-plug all the&nbsp;USB devices from the computer before following the steps.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click on <strong>Start </strong>and in s<strong>tart search box </strong>
type in "<strong>Device Manager</strong>" (with quotes) and press<strong> enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. <strong>Device Manager</strong> Window will be open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. In the list of hardware categories, find and expand&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. <strong>Right-click</strong> on every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>&nbsp;to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Restart the computer and let the Windows install the generic drivers for the USB controllers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Plug in the removable USB device and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p>How can I re-install this driver and regain use of my computer/mouse/keyboard? If possible, is there any way I can do this without losing any information on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iâm not familiar with any indepth computer wording, so if someone could walk me through this as simply as possible, I would be really grateful.</p>

    <title>Spellcheck not working in Windows Live Mail v11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taki v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spellcheck not working in Windows Live Mail v11</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 7, LiveMail version 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set the&nbsp;Spell Check&nbsp;Option to Spell Check when Sending.&nbsp; Also, the English language dictionary is the default and installed.</p>
<p>However, it does not spell check upon send.&nbsp; And I am not able to spell check a message myself before sending because the "ABC" spell check button is grey (not available).</p>
<p>I hope this is not another serious bug in the program. I'm frustrated enough with the v11 bug that will not allow users to sort their Sent email by the TO field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft reports that it is aware of the bug (when is a fix coming, please?!).&nbsp; Outlook Express
 was better than this program,in my view&nbsp;(including that it shared contacts with Office Outlook which Microsoft Live Mail does not).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can shed any light on why I can't spell check, I'd appreciate it. I've already sent out numerous emails with typos.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one stuck on black screen</h2>
                    <p>Iâm an xbox one update preview member. This happened to me yesterday, I was playing Fortnite and was stuck on the loading screen so I quit It then opened it again. But it took to long to start so I had to restart my Xbox. When I turned it on&nbsp;<span>the
 green animation started up and completes</span>&nbsp;but the screen was black, but I can still play some games by pressing the home button on my controller and I still get notifications while the screen is black.&nbsp;<span>I've tried
 to hard reset multiple times as well as unplugging my console and nothing is fixing my problem.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Enforcement rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faded honeypot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enforcement rules</h2>
                    Its very hard to navigate the microsoft website and slow. However the problem we face is having our basic rights taken from us by an awful code of conduct. Many other platforms allow for semi-cursing without negative consequences as getting angry and frustrated
 is part of video games. However reporting on xbox has grown out of hand and handing out suspensions for communication infractions is a joke. Many people in the world use offensive language in different contexts and bans and suspensions are far inferior to
 clean xbox of its toxic community. The code of conduct should be reworded and people should be suspended/banned for more serious infractions because words are free for everybody. They say xbox is a privilege however its a service used by gamers and they donât
 control us we control them because were the ones who use it everyday. If they want to be the way they are now hopefully they economically take a hit and understand that its about experience not performance

<p>All platforms have pretty much an industry standard code of conduct and terms of use. They all enforce these rules, when someone is reported. You actually have no right to behave in a way detrimental to others. Any cursing aimed at others is punishable.

<p>The way that I liken it to is this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS wants Xbox to be rated E for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So lets take for example another business that would be rated E for everyone Chuck E Cheese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before going to this establishment there are rules that you are expected to follow because there could be children around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill use cursing as an example you walk into Chuck E Cheese and somebody cuts in line and laughs at you and calls you a name so you curse back at them do you not think the managers at Chuck E Cheese have a right to ask you to leave and if you do not the police
 will more then likely be called and you could get arrested for trespassing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1st amendment to the US constitution says that the Government can not make laws infringing on our freedom of speech it says nothing about private companies making rules about it.</p>

            I understand what you saying I think they should just block out words that are offensive like Rockstar does with their in game chat.&nbsp; You can't even type certain words in chat and I think thats a good thing.&nbsp; On flipside without the rules they have in
 place Xbox will be chaotic.&nbsp; I really thing&nbsp; people just need to be careful with theirs&nbsp; words because you never know who the receiver is at the other end of the message and what impact your words may have on them.

<p>The important thing to remember is XBLive is rated E for Everyone, all over the world, not just the USA, which includes my young nieces and their elderly grandmother who don't want to be subjected to foulmouth rants while playing a GAME.</p>

            Actually we did not agree we accepted âterms and conditionsâ however conditions are always changing and influenced by many things and just because we accepted does not mean that it cannot be said when something is wrong or seems not right and I understand
 from your pov and many others on this discussion disagree with me however I am another person with a different mindset who thinks this is wrong.Also btw they might not be government âfundedâ but its not that hard to see microsoft industry tab and government
 under it. Sure their not funded but microsoft has a grip on all levels of society and can impact the future, and thats why its so important.

            Njal the blue is 100% correct. You signed up for the service and agreed to the code of conduct. You can't use xbox supposed "censorship" as a way of justifying having a negative impact on someone else's gaming experience. If you want to use "badwords"
 your going to get banned sometimes.

<p><span>Hi Frank,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This might be happening if any of the background programs is conflicting with the installation process of that particular update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services,
 you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you put your system in clean boot you may try installing that particular update and see if you are able to install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click <strong>start</strong>, type
<strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click Ok.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try disabling the antivirus/security software, because at times the security softwareâs might conflict with the installation
 process.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also run the
<strong>System Update Readiness tool</strong> (Checksur.exe) </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Download and run the System Update Readiness tool (Checksur.exe). After you download this tool, it runs a one-time scan for inconsistencies
 that might prevent future servicing operations. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information about how to download and run the System Update Readiness tool, click the following article number to view
 the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: 947821 Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista and for Windows Server 2008:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>In article 947821, scroll down to the "Microsoft Download Center" section, and then click the associated link to download the
 System Update Readiness tool for your operating system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try resetting the Windows Update components, download the Microsoft fix-it from the link and run the wizard which
 automatically resets the windows update components, if this does not work; I recommend that you reset the windows update components manually from the link:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>These steps should fix the issue, give it a try and check if you are able to perform windows updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    Installed two of three updates yesterday.&nbsp; Computer is set to update automatically but apparently it does not always work.&nbsp; The above mentioned update did not install.&nbsp; The is the second time this year alone that I have had this problem.&nbsp; I am not a computer
 "geek" so this is VERY frustrating.&nbsp; I have tried all the troubleshooting that I understand but do not feel comfortable disabling or turning off something in order to install an update.&nbsp; Just how important is this update?&nbsp; Also, after installing the updates
 when I went in to check for updates the computer now shows that I have NEVER checked for updates.&nbsp; My installed updates are a mile long.

            Hi Phyliss, 
<br />
<br />So when you click on the icon to launch the app, nothing will launch, only this error? 
<br />
<br />I know you said this started happening since the last update, when was that? Sometimes they roll out new updates to remedy issues that may have occurred in previous updates. 
<br />
<br />I did find a link that may help as well. <a href="https://support.wildtangent.com/hc/en-us/articles/205047779-Games-App-not-launching-on-Windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.wildtangent.com/hc/en-us/articl...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click on the desktop icon
<br />Select Properties
<br />Click the Compatibility Tab
<br />Make sure the Compatibility mode box is NOT checked. 
<br />If you unchecked the box - be sure to click the Apply Button. 
<br />
<br />Let me know and we can move forward!
<br />- C

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Please try the following , hopefully they will get a solution for your query.
<br />
<br />On the Games App Icon in your Start Menu, Right Click on it.
<br />
<br />Find âPropertiesâ and then click on Compatibility.
<br />
<br />Un-check the option at last. (Run this program as an administrator) 
<br />
<br />Apply these change.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.
<br />

            When you launch the WildTangent Games App you see an error that states that the Games App is not intended to be run as Administrator, Cannot be run as an Administrator, Won't run as Administrator, or something similar. 
<br />
<br />In order to fix this error, you will want to change the privilege level to make sure you are not an administrator for this particular program. To do so, please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Find the Games App Icon on your desktop or in your Start Menu.
<br />2. Right Click on the icon.
<br />3. Click on âPropertiesâ (This is usually the last option on the list).
<br />4. Click the âCompatibilityâ tab.
<br />5. At the bottom of this tab, make sure the option, âRun this program as an administrator,â is not checked.
<br />
<br />6. Click Apply.
<br />7. Click OK.
<br />
<br />Then launch the Games App again! That's it. 
<br />

<br />
<br />If you are unable to do this...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the game again.
