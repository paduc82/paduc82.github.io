            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you aware of the one touch shortcut key (Fn + the function key or directly the function key) that is used to control wireless options (WLAN, Bluetooth, WWAN)? If that is disabled, the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;icon will disappear from the taskbar, even if you reinstall/update
 drivers. Make sure you enable the wireless and you can see the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;icon in taskbar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reply if the issue is not solved or if you feel the suggestion is irrelevant to the issue.</div>
        </p>

            Hello Balaji,<br />
Thanks for reply.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yes I had tried this many times but it also doesn't work. Actually Bluetooth radio driver is missing from the device manager. So,&nbsp;disappearance of Bluetooth Icon from taskbar is not the problem. problem is that system is not&nbsp;detecting&nbsp;&nbsp;the bluetooth hardware.
 hope you got it..</div>

            In that case, did you try changing settings in BIOS for availability of wireless? If it is hidden in BIOS, Windows can't detect the hardware. Refer your PC manual/documentation for changing this option in BIOS. You can press F2 when you see Dell logo on
 startup to go to BIOS settings.
<div><br />
<div>If that did not solve the issue, contact Dell support for further assistance.</div>

            Press F2 during boot (when you see Dell logo at starting) to open BIOS settings. There, there is an option to disable/enable WLAN, WWAN and Bluetooth. Check the settings. Refer your PC documentation/manual for assistance in handling BIOS.

    <title>Windows 8 Media Center not recognising long established library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a microsoft user_788  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Media Center not recognising long established library</h2>
                    <div>Media Center isn't recognising my libraries. Here's the long story cut as short as I can:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I installed Windows 8 with Media Center a few months. No problems, set up my music and movie library easily enough and it was all working fine until yesterday.
<div>Yesterday whilst setting up a 'Now Playing' list in my music library something went wibble and I could only access the songs on that list - not the rest of the library. Trying to re-add the library didn't work, nor did a long list of other things that
 I tried from both Google and the Microsoft Live Support Tech (over the course of about two hours.) I should hasten to add that all media is on an an attached second internal HDD, and was loading fine with other programs - in fact WMC would open the music if
 opening from Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't keep track of everything I tried, but these included removing/re-adding the WMC component, deleting what the Tech thought was the library database file (mcepg3-0.db and folder) and eventually we had to settle for a workaround - setting up a local
 user account, which seemed to create a fresh start for WMC. That allowed me to add my music library and whilst not ideal got me access to my music. What I later found out was that whilst it had worked for my music, my movie library (that had been fine) now
 won't add - the folder shows up but the library doesn't populate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this and how I fix it?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>What specific alignment grid are you talking about? Is it in an application like Paint? Does it go across the whole screen? Does it happen all the time or intermittently? Also, what version and Bit depth of Windows 7 are you running? Can you recall something
 more specific you were doing when the grid first appeared, besides just clicking on something? Were any other programs running at the same time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            Last night my cat walked across the lower part of my key board, no applications were running, the screen was just showing my normal desktop, and now, tick-tack-toe style, two evenly spaced vertical and two evenly spaced horizontal thin grey lines are now
 present that make a nine-box grid overlay on my entire screen, edge to edge.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am running Windows 7-64 bit with a 2560x1440 LCD display, NVIDIA 560 GeForce graphics. &nbsp;The grid lines appear in all applications, even in my Windows XP virtual machine set up inside Win 7.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have tried different screen resolutions, rebooting, different applications, explored many settings, but the lines persist, unchanged and unmoving, as if I had placed thin grey lines on a plastic overlay onto the screen.<br />
<div><br />
<div>One time, while the display was switching between applications, a small text line appeared near my mouse cursor that was at that moment in the center box of the grid, that showed the following words: Alignment Grid. &nbsp;I have been unable to reproduce the
 mouse over text.<br />
<div><br />
<div>So with that name, I turned to the net, and other than this thread, I am unable to find any reference to these mysterious Alignment Grid lines.</div>
<div><br />
<div>These grid lines appear to have nothing to do with icon alignment, yet all other reference to "alignment grid windows 7" in a google search seem to refer to icon grid spacing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because the lines appeared exactly at the same time as the cat's key presses, I am tending to discount hardware failure. &nbsp;And because the cat was walking near the space bar, I suspect some sort of &lt;ctrl&gt; &lt;alt&gt; type key combination was pressed to activate
 the grid lines.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would rather find the solution to broaden my knowledge, than restore from backup, so any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <strong><u>I found the solution</u></strong>.&nbsp; I have an ASUS PB278Q monitor and somehow the cat, through the keyboard, activated the Alignment Grid mode of the monitor.&nbsp; I entered the monitor menu, went into System Setup, and chose All Reset.&nbsp; This eliminated
 the grid lines on my screen.&nbsp; I do not know how the Alignment Grid mode was activated directly through the keyboard and not by entering the monitor menu and pressing the keys on the underside right edge of the monitor to navigate to the Alignment Grid activation.&nbsp;
 I will still try to figure out what&nbsp;keyboard combination the cat used, and what corresponding keys would deactivate it.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp;&nbsp;And a&nbsp;backup system restore would not have helped me at all, since the problem was a monitor setting.&nbsp;

            I'd just like to thank you for solving this problem. &nbsp;The grid was extremely annoying. I know not why it turned on, but nice to know what to do if it happens again.

            <blockquote><strong><u>I found the solution</u></strong>.&nbsp; I have an ASUS PB278Q monitor and somehow the cat, through the keyboard, activated the Alignment Grid mode of the monitor.&nbsp; I entered the monitor menu, went into System Setup, and
 chose All Reset.&nbsp; This eliminated the grid lines on my screen.&nbsp; I do not know how the Alignment Grid mode was activated directly through the keyboard and not by entering the monitor menu and pressing the keys on the underside right edge of the monitor to navigate
 to the Alignment Grid activation.&nbsp; I will still try to figure out what&nbsp;keyboard combination the cat used, and what corresponding keys would deactivate it.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp;&nbsp;And a&nbsp;backup system restore would not have helped me at all, since the problem was a
 monitor setting.&nbsp; </blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Easier solution</u>:&nbsp; </strong>I just experienced the same problem with my ASUS VX229H.&nbsp; The alignment grid is activated by the far left Quickfit&nbsp;button.&nbsp; Press the Menu button to exit this function.&nbsp; For more information see User guide page 1-5:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I use the ASUS Monitor and it appears that this issue is more prevalent with ASUS users. The buttons on the right of the screen is what causes the problem. I finally figured it out. It's not a mystery. When you try to reach for anything on your desk ...that
 is underneath those buttons, you may accidently crease touch or rub the bottom of your monitor... bear in mind the first button on the left is&nbsp;very sensitive or has some light touch capability... But whichever it is, that is your issue....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to rub your finger through it again and notice it change back to where it was...It may seem tricky or jumpy but in the end, you will get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly is that grid box for is what I am just curious about. </p>

<p>I have a ASUS VS 278. I had let in sleep mode for several hours. When I woke it from it's sleep, there were the grid lines. No amount of switching off and on again would get rid of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I got on to this site and the menu button was mentioned. I hit the menu button and a panel appeared, but I could not use it because my icon kept moving behind it. I was just noting my monitor&nbsp; details with the intention of phoning ASUS when I
 noticed the grid lines had disappeared! </p>
<p>
</p><p>All is well, that ends well I suppose, but it is an annoying feature of ASUS monitors&nbsp; which&nbsp; could be left out, especially as it does not appear to be of much use.</p>

<h2>            Drivers for my Xbox Wireless Gaming Receiver won&#39;t install correctly on Windows 8</h2>
                    I have found many threads online about installing drivers and software for the gaming receiver, but none of them have worked out for me.
<div>Whenever I install the drivers for the "unknown device" in my device manager, instead of showing the driver as&nbsp;Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows Version:
<i>Insert Version Here</i>, it only says <i>Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver.&nbsp;</i></div>

    <title>RMB click on menu items not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RMB click on menu items not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I might be the odd people use RMB click on menu items. </p>
<p>And since I upgraded to windows 10, I'm getting a lot of places RMB no longer works.</p>
<p>For example, I right click the icon pinned on taskbar, let's say explorer, I get the context menu, which lists short cut to desktop, documents, explorer etc, etc, I then RMB click on desktop, it give me a new menu with "open", "properties", "unpin from this
 list", if I RMB click on any of them, nothing happens. I have to use LMB click to effectively click onto the item.</p>
<p>This is the same with Edge when I right click a link and right click again on for example "open in new tab".
</p>
<p>What's the purpose of removing the RMB click ability?</p>
<p>Plus I can still right click on desktop context menu, this is now just inconsistent experience.
</p>
<p>Is there anyway to enable the RMB click again? I know it might be just me, habits are hard to change, I'd rather use Chrome than Edge for just this reason. But I don't have any choices for the taskbar.
</p>
<p>Anyone knows the settings, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Please, stop replying that we have to make a clean boot and begin to fix that operating system. I have the same problem too, as well as performance problems. I used SFC and DISM with no result. The problem still exists.

<h2>            Windows 10 wont install Error 0xC1900101 - 0x40019</h2>
                    <p>My Asus X200CA notebook is failing to re-upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>0xC1900101-0x40019</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>This installation failed in the Second_Boot phase with an error during OOBE operation.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Notebook was pre-installed Windows 8 but had been running Windows 10 for a good few months. During the latest update the charger failed and the notebook died. For my sins I took the Notebook in for repairs to Curries / PC world they replaced the charger
 under warranty but being the helpful souls they are also replaced the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is now the issue as when i now try to re-install Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool, after having performed available windows updates, the installation downloads and runs fine up to around 25%, it then reboots and hangs on the Asus splash
 screen (no loading gif), the drive ticks on for about 5 minutes then stops. 14 hours later nothing has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the installation twice over similar lengths of time. Each time i have to force crash and 'roll-back' to Windows 8. All other advance recovery options fail including restore point which for some reason can't even see the restore i created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice from someone who has overcome this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I had seen similar threads and suggestions. The checks did not make a difference.

<p>
</p><p>Ultimately i have just re-run the 8.1 update and will just leave it at that. Windows 10 just isn't going to work again for me. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hay que dejar pulsado el bot√≥n un segundo o dos ¬øhas probado eso? Si no se enciende as√≠ es que realmente no tiene arreglo, y deber√≠as seguir el consejo del amigo Hammil XDDD</p>

<p>Hablando del mando, es dificil saber el problema no somos tecnicos para poder arreglar el problema, ademas puede salir defectuoso de fabrica. De una misma remesa no los comprueban todos... Si hace poco te has comprado la Xbox 360, y no han pasado m√°s de
 6 meses los dispositivos o accesorios tiene garant√≠a. Puedes llamar al SAT y te mandaran uno nuevo. Eso si a veces piden el ticket, pero no creo que sea un problema. UN SALUDO!</p>

<p>Ahora se me ha ocurrido! Dependiendo de la marca de las pilas, por ejemplo "SUPERPILA"(PILAS MADE IN MERCADONA) Me funcionaba pero cada dos por tres fallaba el contacto y se me apagaba el mando y lo que comentas que ni siquiera se encendia el boton guia.
 Luego probe duracell y no se si es problema de medidas estandard de pilas,peso o calidad, pero funcionan mejor. Las de IKEA tb van de #!%@ madre!</p>

<p>Well when this happens I reboot and after a reboot everything works. No bluescreen at all.</p>
<p>But this always happens the first time I start my computer after It's been off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the cause of this? :S</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1: Uninstall the Graphic/Display drivers</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press ‚Äú<strong><span>Windows Logo</span></strong>‚Äù + ‚Äú<strong><span>X</span></strong>‚Äù
 keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Click on ‚Äú<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>‚Äù from that list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Search for the graphic/display drivers from the device list, right click on it and then select ‚Äú<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>‚Äù.
 On the un-installation window, if you have an option: ‚Äú<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>‚Äù you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the restart, you may again open the Device Manager and then click on the ‚Äú<strong><span>Scan for hardware
 changes</span></strong>‚Äù button at the top of the Device Manager window and check if Windows 8.1 detects the display devices and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically. If that happens, then check if it resolves the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 2: Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer‚Äôs website:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persist, then there might be a possibility that the Graphic/display drivers are corrupt. Hence, you may refer to the
<strong><span>manufactures‚Äô website</span></strong> and install the latest Graphic/Display drivers for the device.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8\8.1, and 10 have a feature called Fast Startup... Under some circumstances it can cause a problem booting the machine. You might try turning it off...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem is most likely a driver not loading properly with Fast Startup enabled... Graphics would be the first thing I would check...</p>
<p />

<h2>            Host Process for windows keeps crashing</h2>
                    Every so often, at seemingly random times, i get a quick window that comes up saying 'Background Intelligence Transfer has encountered a problem' with a blue bar that runs across the message. This then turns into a 'Host Process for Windows Services stopped
 working and was closed<br />
A problem caused the application to stop working correctly. Windows will notify you if a solution is available. (Close button)<br />
<br />
And it causes my appearance to go to the very basic setting, and it slowly recovers back to Aero settings, but sometimes it doesn't recover at all.
<br />
<br />
I found a link about updating my BITS, but it said 'this is not appropriate for your machine'
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<p>3-4 days on the test account. It was the same 'BITS has stopped working' then 'host process crashed'</p>
<p>I have taken this up with the Live team, and my case number is&nbsp;SRX1090636887ID</p>

<p><span>Ben, I am not the best person who can provide you support with this. You have reached a group which only supports issues with Windows Live Messenger. The problem
 you have now could be better resolved by your technicians from your Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) since they are the ones who possess the necessary knowledge and tools to assist you with this matter. It seems that your C++ program is acting up. Please
 verify if you have the computer manufacturer's phone number. For a list of computer manufacturers, visit http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;65416 .
