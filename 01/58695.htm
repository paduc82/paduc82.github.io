    <title>Forcing resolution to CRT monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tervi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forcing resolution to CRT monitor</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I recently got 2 Win7 64bit installations, both performing pretty well excepting a couple of issues. Actually the biggest one is following:<br />
I have pro-class CRT monitor Sony GDM FW900, 24" widescreen. Sony stopped win driver support with WinXP, anyway, I'd be really glad if I could keep using it with the new OS from many reasons; like there are still only a few quite expensive LCDs that can at
 least touch similar image quality and possibilities.</p>
<p>I tried many ways without any success, it is still detected as a generic CRT monitor and only limited resolution/freq. settings are available. Now I used AMD/ATi Catalyst version which allowed setting custom resolution, however, it seems to be still overridden
 with windows settings, so nothing more than 1600x1200/60Hz.</p>
<p>Please, is there any way to simply force/unlock custom resolutions for CRT monitor? I know all of the monitor capabilities and settings it can handle, but I also cannot hope in a new driver update from monitor manufacturer any more. And actually I don't
 care if it could be damaged or so, it is out of warranty and it maximum res./freq. is far higher that maximum adapter output resolution, so I simply wanna set it as I wish.</p>
<p>Thanks for tips.</p>

<p>It is probably because windows 7 won;t support CRT monitors so the screen might&nbsp; not be focused or look propeller i am afraid to say but it is time for a flat screen monitor even if it is a second hand one my first flat screen monitor was second hand. or
 have a look on amazon for one.</p>

            Sony don't appear to offer support beyond XP. Maybe you should consider two 24" LCD's. Your desk would appreciate it too..

<h2>            Computer shuts down when finalizing windows 7 install. Then wont work.</h2>
                    Ok this is a bit of a long 1. About 3 weeks ago now my PC seemed to have died on me, I've had it for around 3-4 years now and built it myself. All has been fine until now.
<br />
<br />
So It started with my PC sitting on a black screen when i turned it on, after a few restarts it would eventually work.... then all of a sudden a few days later it just would get past the black screen at all. then i started getting the infinite loops of start
 up repair. I'd repair it, system restore it but nothing worked, after the repair id restart it and then get a black screen again then system repair on next boot and it just looped like this. Also id have a bunch of weird symbols and stuff on my boot screen
 instead of the information its meant to show and yellow lines in my bios, So i thought maybe it was my mobo so i changed it out to an old 1 that i used to used that still worked fine. when i done this I i still had all the weird characters and squiggles. so...
 i took my gfx card out and ran it on the onboard gfx (other(newer) mobo didnt have onbaord) and this fixed the sysmols and lines so i guess my gfx card had went ?
<br />
<br />
So after all that i tried to boot it but still just infinite start up repair looping. So i thought last resort ima have to reformat.... so after my win7 disk took about a week to finally load (i had to take the disk in and out for it to advance to next screens,
 This win7 disk worked fine a few months ago and fine in my mams laptop.) i reformated. all went well untill it restarted... it completed the instalation and then took me to the page that says "Setup is starting services" etc and then it just shut its self
 off.... after turnin it back on i get "setup is starting services" and then a box saying "The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered and unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install windows, Click "OK" to restart the computer,
 and then restart the installation". But ofcourse this just goes in a repeat cycle :( I've tried installing win XP as well but it doesn't copy all the files, and i haven't tried vista, the disk loads really slow like 7 so I'm guessing it will have the same
 outcome... and i don't really want vista on my PC :\<br />
<br />
So now I'm beginning to think maybe my GFX card and HDD have went? but I'm really not sure. I've searched around and read a lot of stuff, done a lot of stuff but nothing has worked. Id go out and buy a new HDD, but its just the fact that if it doesn't solve
 anything it would be really annoying.<br />
<br />
Oh, i can also plug my old HDD into my computer and it works fine (old win xp installed on it) but i cant reformat this HDD as its my back up with a lot of stuff on it and i have nowhere else to store it.... making me think more that it could be my HDD.<br />
<br />
Thank you to anyone that had the time and patience to read this, Any help and advice is much appreciated. Thanks again in advance!<br />

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the error occurs, what other options does it give you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug your network devices for at least 5 minutes to give them a restart. Then go ahead and do a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If you have Microsoft account you can recover your password but if you don't have Microsoft account and you forgot your local password then you can't recover it, until you reset your laptop.
<br />
<br />I would like you to see the below mentioned article for more details.

<h2>            how to change the account name of a Windows 10 local account&#63;</h2>
                    Have set up my Windows 10 laptop for signing in with a local account, rather than a Microsoft account. I now want to change the name that I have chosen for the local account. Can't seem to find how to do that - any answers?

<h2>            right-click 2-finger tap not working after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10. The 2-finger tap right-click on my touchpad is no longer working. The setting is enabled in the Synaptics/touchpad settings. Driver is listed as up-to-date. I have a Lenovo ideapad touch screen laptop. All other multi-touch features
 work fine. I tried downloading the driver manually from Lenovo and it gives me the error "Synaptics device not found!", even when run in compatibility mode or as administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows, how can I make the 2-finger R-click function start working again?</p>
<p>

<p>As a precaution, if you submitted payment with a credit card there will be a forced automatic renewal option. Although some sources say you can remove this online - that feature is broken and the only current way to remove this is by calling their support
 at: Toll free: (800) 4MY-XBOX or (800) 469-9269</p>
<p>If you opt not to cancel the auto-renew, by the time you see the charge on your bank account it may be too late to request a refund. (For myself it wasn't charged until 30 days after the 'billing date')</p>
<p>If you do opt to call them to cancel the auto-renew be sure to have the information listed from this page handy:

<h2>            my hard drive space is disappearing</h2>
                    <p>My hard drive is usually mostly full, but I usually keep at least 1 GB free. Last night my dad was using the computer and a message popped up saying the the available space on the C Drive was low. Once he was finished I checked it and it said that there
 was around 200 MB available. I went into Norton Security Suite and ran the disk cleanup which freed up around 700 MB, and I went into my own files and deleted some old files that I no longer needed freeing up another 200+ MB. Less than 24 hours later I have
 the same problem, I have downloaded a few files during that time but all of them combined maybe equal 100 MB. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>With that little free, temporary files, virtual memory, hibernation, system restore&nbsp;and updates all come to mind.</p>
<p>Free up the space - Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.&nbsp; If you have a 60GB hard drive, that is about 55GB
 formatted.&nbsp; If your WIndows/applications install base is quite large (games or something)&nbsp;- maybe 15GB taken up by that.&nbsp; That leaves 40GB for your data.&nbsp; Archive what you don't use often.&nbsp; You really should keep just&nbsp;about 8GB free on that system at all times.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_hotfix_backup.htm</a> )</p>
<p>You can run Disk Cleanup - built into Windows XP - to erase all but your latest restore point and cleanup even more "loose files"..</p>

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>
<p>Other ways to free up space..</p>
<p>SequoiaView<br />

<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html</a></p>
<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used.&nbsp; Then you can determine what to do.</p>

    <title>High CPU &#47; RAM Usage after full system restore Windows 8.1 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> novicetechwannabe  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU &#47; RAM Usage after full system restore Windows 8.1 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop that's only a couple years old. It came pre-installed with Windows 8. After I upgraded to Windows 8.1 it started having difficulties in certain areas, mainly the File History. It wasn't anything too troublesome, so after
 a while I let it go. I upgraded to Windows 10 and things got hanky. Everything started moving S-L-O-W. EVERYTHING. CPU usage was often at 98-99% and Memory was up there as well.&nbsp;I eventually restored it back to factory defaults, however that did not correct
 the issue. As of today, I cannot&nbsp;connect the machine to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that there is a csrss.exe running on Services as well as Console. I've also found that there is a csrss.exe.mui tucked away in there somewhere. Likewise there's a csrss.exe.mui in the old windows files (which I'm not able to delete for some
 odd reason). I'm not sure if that's my problem or not, but most everything I find online indicates I need to download some program in order to locate any potential Trojan or other viruses / malware. Without having access to the internet on that PC, it's proving
 difficult to isolate the cause of my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give me some command prompts or search suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, FYI the system has a 500GB HD and 4GB RAM, however that was never an issue before... and, considering it's been restored to factory defaults, I'd assume it shouldn't have any now.

<p>Okay so I bought and downloaded GTA: SA but it wouldn't run because I didn't have a hard drive. Well my new hard drive just came in today so I deleted it, and re-downloaded it onto my hard drive. Now an error is popping up saying "disc read error" or something
 similar. Another error message comes out saying "try to download again"&nbsp; which I have numerous times. I've seen similar threads but hell, I wanted to make my own!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This new hard drive you purchased, are you 100% sure it's an original Xbox 360 hard drive and not a 3rd party fake/knock off. Usually these hard drives look very much alike to the official Xbox 360 hard drives but are sold for a very cheap price on 3rd party
 sites like eBay/Amazon Marketplace.<br />
<br />
That would be the first thing to check, as that's usually the cause of such errors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can I tell if it's an official microsoft hard drive? When I go to my storage devices it says "Microsoft" under the hard drive? But I know many other people are having this problem as well..</p>

<p>Well the first indication would be where you purchased it from. The second, would be if it was an Xbox 360 S hard drive it has a unique serial number that you can take to the online service site
<strong><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> </strong>and input into the order new supplies section under Hard Drive to see if it goes through. The fake/knock off hard drives don't have a serial number on the back, or if they do it's a fake serial number
 that will not work in that section.<br />
<br />
You can also easily check by getting a disc copy of an original Xbox game on the backwards compatibility list and see if that works, you'll know instantly if that's a fake or if it's real and it's just an issue with this download.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            RUNASADMIN property is set into registry for my application</h2>
                    
<p>When i login to windows 7 machine as standard user, and install my .net application to all users(by choosing program files path), it asks admin credentials (as expected). After&nbsp;providing it , installer installs it to all users. But when i run my exe it asks
 for credential(if standard user) or consent (if admin) prompts. The reason behind that is while i install to all users&nbsp;through standar user account i have to give admin credentials. In that time, an entry is stored in to the registry as Name : "&lt;App Path&gt;"&nbsp;
 Data :"&lt;RUNASADMIN&gt;" under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers". After i deleted it, there is no prompt.</p>
<p>How to prevent this entry?</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />Fix windows update errors here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />But your best bet to install the latest update would be to go through Greg's clean install guide here: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Or for something with a little less instructions you can go here and download an installation media for the update, then follow the instructions on the page for updating your PC : <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Please try the above and let me know what occurs.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.       
        </p>

            Hi AAU1,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Start Menu Search Problem -&#62; Appdata subfolder doesn&#39;t recognise the file link</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a problem for some time now, and I can't seem to find any sort of help to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I use the search feature in the Start Menu for Windows 8.1, i happen upon the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I search for the word 'mouse', which gives me a few options, for the mouse and touchpad settings for my notebook. I then select the result for the settings, which should open the settings options in the desktop, but instead of that, a popup error
 appears with the following header:</p>
<p>
</p><p>" C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Packages\windows.immersivecontrolpanel_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Indexed\Settings\it-IT\AAA_SettingsPagePCSystemDeviceSettings.settingcontent-ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the default programs control panel. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I am Italian, thus the it-IT option instead of US one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>this happens for every search on the Start Menu that opens files on the desktop except for stuff like the calculator (both the calculator for the desktop and the one for the start menu work fine) or icons with a blue background (basically options with a
 green icon fall under this problem but not 'control panel')</p>
<p>
</p><p>All files contained in the it-IT folder of the local state AppData subsection give me the same answer if i click on them individually, and of course going to the association option in the control panel does not allow me to fix these broken associations.
 Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I have also checked the computer (Asus) with chkdsk and sfc scan. The first did not find any problem, the second found another problem which i manually fixed but that was not pertaining to this one.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Francesca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the effort put towards trying to resolve the issue. Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you receive any error if you try to open the file by directly following the file path?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer&nbsp;prior to the issue?</li><li>If you have another user account on this computer, does the issue persist on the other user account as well?</li><li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li></ol>
<p>This could be caused due to that particular file may not have a program installed associated with it. This could be due to file explorer issue. However, I understand that you are facing this issue not only with that particular file but more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to directly go to the location of the file and try to open it. Let us know&nbsp;if you are still getting any error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you remember making any changes in the computer recently or if you think this issue did not occur prior to any particular date, I would recommend performing system restore and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Start the computer in safe mode</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key&nbsp;+<strong> C</strong> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Click on <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Change PC Settings </strong>and then
<strong>General</strong>.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;Scroll down to <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Startup</strong>, click <strong>
Restart</strong> <strong>Now</strong>.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Options</strong>,
<strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;Click <strong>Restart</strong>, select <strong>Safe</strong> <strong>mode</strong> and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Step 1: </strong>To restore your PC to an earlier point in time:</div>
<ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> in the search box, and tap or click
<strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>Recovery</strong> in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click
<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Open</strong> <strong>System</strong> <strong>Restore</strong>, and then follow the instructions.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the above steps do not work since the issue is related to Search, try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>System</strong></li><li>Click <strong>System</strong> <strong>Protection</strong> and then click <strong>
System</strong> <strong>Restore</strong> tab</li><li>When system restore window appears, click <strong>Next</strong></li><li>By default it will show you a restore point created already. Click to check the box which says "<strong>Show more restore points</strong>"</li><li>Select one if you think this issue did not occur and click <strong>Next</strong>, click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Important: </strong><span><em>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you have installed after that date are removed.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you receive any error if you try to open the file by directly following the file path?</li></ul>
<p>If I click on the file directly from the it-IT folder (<em>AppData\Local\Packages\windows.immersivecontrolpanel_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Indexed\Settings\it-IT</em>) the files don't open up and it says exactly the same thing (that there is no association
 to any program). If I search for the program itself through a desktop search (by opening a folder, going to Control Panel and searching for example for the mouse and touchpad settings, they open normally, it's just the shortcut from the start menu and the
 folder itself that do not work properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer&nbsp;prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>I am not sure whether with Windows 8 it worked and it is when I updated to Windows 8.1 that it stopped working, but when I got the computer the search worked perfectly until at one point it did not anymore. (it is not a very recent thing but i've been trying
 on and off for months to find a way to fix it)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have another user account on this computer, does the issue persist on the other user account as well?</li></ul>
<p>I only have one account since it's a private notebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li></ul>
<p>No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(I thought about doing a Refresh to bring the PC back to factory without losing my files, but the pc alerted me that I would lose a lot of apps that came pre-installed on this pc if i did so, and for which i have no cd to reinstall them afterwards. (which
 made me decide not to do any refresh. i hoped it'd keep my programs but it's basically identical to a full formatting only that it keeps my files, which would have been the same as me backing up the files elsewhere, but i'd still lose programs and apps i have
 no way to reinstall afterwards, so)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried making systems restores in the past, not just for this particular problem, but the few restore points were all apparently made afterwards and so nothing got fixed. i had a restore happen two days ago for unrelated things and yeah, nothing changed
 since it's been a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try opening the pc on safe mode to see if there's anything i can do in that setting and will report if the problem persists in safe mode. thank you for your consideration!</p>
<p>
</p><p>C. Francesca</p>

<p>

</p><p>So, my guess is that you have some registry corruption or a permissions problem.&nbsp; In either case ProcMon could be used to help discover the exact cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be best to have two traces to compare for their essential differences, one with the problem
 and one without, both doing otherwise the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, as another guess, you could try the PowerShell workaround that is often advised for various symptoms with the Settings charm.</p>

<h2>            Are Windows Updates faster via automatic downlaod or manual download</h2>
                    
<p>Vista 32 Bit home premium with updated SP</p>
<p>Like I have my system set to check for microsoft updates daily and &nbsp;downlaod/ install at a certain time.</p>
<p>But sometimes I will click the "check for updates button" and then go ahead and click install</p>
<p>so does it take longer to download and install when I do it that way vs auto? It seems like it does, but that could be because I'm actually waiting, whereas the auto happens at night</p>

<p><span>The Windows Update client on your PC checks the Windows Update server at Microsoft for the availability of new updates at random intervals and such&nbsp; randomization ensures that the Windows Update server is not overloaded with requests for
 updates all at the same time. The client is very efficient in checking for new updates and searches only for updates that have been added since the last time updates were searched, allowing it to find updates quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>When checking for updates, the Windows Update client evaluates whether the update is appropriate for your computer using guidelines defined by the publisher of the update, for example, Microsoft Office.</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is not online at the time you specified to check for updates, then the Windows Update client begins checking every five hours&nbsp;or something like that until it successfully finds updates.</span></p>
<p>If Windows wants to install updates at shutdown it is because&nbsp;Automatic Updates has downloaded some updates but not all the updates that you have requested or set for automatic download. It will install the updates that it has already downloaded and will
 notify you in due course when the rest are downloaded.</p>
<p>When you manually check you are checking the Windows Update server directly so all updates are listed applicable to your system and you can immediately choose to download and install.&nbsp;It's good to do a manual update now and again just to check on what other
 updates are available, such as optional updates.</p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall will not turn off</h2>
                    <p>I have Internet Security provided by Bullguard so their Firewall is ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have noted that the Windows Firewall as stated in Security &amp; Maintenance that both are shown ON. Therefore I need to turn off the Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to turn off the Windows Firewall by carrying out the following procedure without success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going into the Control Panel &amp; clicking the Windows Firewall. Clicked in the left hand column, &nbsp;"Turn Windows Firewall on or off"</p>
<p>The display thus turns to "Customise Settings".</p>
<p>For both the Private &amp; Public the Firewall is shown as being ON. Therefore clicked &nbsp;on BOTH "Turn
<strong>off</strong> Windows Firewall" for both the&nbsp;Private &amp; Public network settings followed by clicking
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>New screen display appears "Help Protect your PC with Windows Firewall" showing that Windows Firewall is OFF. However within a couple of seconds a similar display appears on screen showing that both the Private &amp; Public networks Windows Firewall has automatically
 been turned back on.</p>
<p>Any solutions please.</p>

<p>You may be better off asking Bullguard to confirm: forum -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bullguard.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bullguard.com/forum</a> or support -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bullguard.com/support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bullguard.com/support.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not got Bullguard to check/test myself, but a quick forum search found these recent posts:</p>

<h2>            &#34;Music&#34; folder and &#34;My Music&#34; folder</h2>
                    Wince upgrading to&nbsp; Windows 7 I have what I think is a lot of duplication on my computer. I have more on my new computer than the entire size of the hard drive on my old computer - and I certainly haven't added that much data. One exampe I have found is
 this: I have a folder called "Music". In that folder I have my music files. In that folder I also have a folder called "My Music" and in that folder I have the same files as in the "Music" folder. If this is confusing to you, think how confusing it is to
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">me</span></em></strong>. By the way. The "My Music" folder has a little music note symbol next to the name.<br />
<br />
When I upgraded to Windows 7 did the program create duplicates of files or something?<br />
<br />
What's going on?

<p>Hi <strong>Semana,<br />
</strong><br />
1) How did you try to upgrade to windows 7?</p>
<p>2) From which operating system you upgraded to windows 7?</p>
<p>3) How did you try to transfer&nbsp; the files?</p>
<p>4) Does it happens only on music folder or do you face similar issueon&nbsp; different folder?</p>
<p>5) Did you try to delete the music folder ?</p>
<p>6) Do you&nbsp; get any error message while trying to delete music folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It seems to be an issue with the infection on the machine. I will recommend you to Run online scan to check any malware or virus activity.</p>
<p>Below links will help you run free scan on the computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://housecall.trendmicro.com/</a></p>
<p>I would suggest you to take backup of that folder and delete it and then check if the folder comes back after restart. If yes then it is a possible virus. If no then it might have been duplicated.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you may try rebuilding the Media library on your computer and check for the issue to do that you may follow the below provided steps.</p>
<p>1. Shutdown windows media player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Stop the media sharing service.&nbsp; Go to Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;All Control Panel Items-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services.&nbsp; Right-click on the ‚ÄúWindows Media Player Network Sharing Service‚Äù and select Stop.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to ‚Äúc:\Users\‚Äùyour username‚Äù\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player.&nbsp; Now delete the files named CurrentDatabase_***.wmdb and LocalMLS_*.wmdb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Start the media sharing service.</p>
<p>5. Now start Windows Media Player and watch it build up your library again.<br />

            Thanks much for the thoughtful reply. I will work on the items you mention.<br />
<br />
I can answer a couple of your questions quickly:<br />
<br />
I upgraded with a disk I received from DELL. When I bought the DELL laptop it had Vista on it and DELL sent me an upgrade disk when Windows 7 came out. Everything seemed to smoothly.<br />
<br />
I have Microsoft Security Essentials on my comdputer and I did a complete scan two days ago so I don't think it is a virus.<br />
<br />
I'll work on the other items in your reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
semana<br />

Oh, one other thing which might not be in your area. Twice I've had this experience and dthe first time it just went away. The experience is this: I try to use hyperlinks, either in a work document or in an email and it tells me I don't have the permission
 level to perform this function. Strange.

                    I got 3 live messages all at 7:00pm 7/8/2013 - 1 day - 1 week - 2 weeks. All happend at the same time? I think they might have accidentally did the 2 and 1 weeks because I didn't even do anything. I checked my email and the violations were all fake and
 non legitiment. If someone can go over my account and see why I HAD to har the extra THREE weeks that would be great.

            Hi JammyDoran,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

</p><p>I think it started after the last Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>I don't have any other problems.</p>
<p>Boot speed seems normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happens every time I turn on my system and login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix it?</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to install a program on SD Card&#63;</h2>
                    <p>original title: install program on to an sd card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I install a program on to an sd card and run it from there using it for extra space? I know you can with an external usb hard drive but what about an sd or flash card? I also know you can do it with a long process using an external HD then copy files
 to the sd card but can you do it&nbsp;straight&nbsp; from the install process.</p>
