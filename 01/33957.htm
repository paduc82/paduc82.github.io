<h2>            C and E drives are switched</h2>
                    I tried a clean install of Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;while I had Vista on my laptop. When all was said and done, My C Drive has 360 of 454 GB free while E Recovery has 4.48 of 11 Gb free. Everything I install goes on the Recovery Drive, not to my C: Drive. How do I switch
 these? I can only do so much before it tells me that I am running out of memory.

<p><span>Hi redgoat,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed Windows 7 under recovery E drive then whatever you install will automatically get installed on the E recovery.
 You will not be able to switch this unless you reinstall Windows 7 on the C drive, try the step below before you try to reinstall Windows 7 this is to make the C drive as the active partition.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the following commands by accessing the command prompt from the Windows recovery environment (Winre).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type

    <title>Xbox Home switch reset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Home switch reset&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have had nothing but problems with setting home xbox. I have posted on This forum with my issue I followed the advice. I contacted support by phone and I have numerous chats live online chat box. But I still have same problem. I have now used all
 my switches including the bonus survey one. Last night I was told to set my main xbox that has gold to home xbox. And nothing on the other xbox.. Still no game share and no xbox live share. I'm getting pretty frustrated with this situation. As it was working
 fine. Until the server was down over the weekend beginning of January. If I could please get my switches reset as I have been mislead by many xbox advisors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only want to home share with my son in the same house like we did before..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to make a complaint but the website just sends me around in a loop.&nbsp; This function needs to be made a lot simpler. I will not be waiting 12 months I can say that much. I won't be paying for more xbox live and re purchasing games.. Is it possible
 to get a call back..&nbsp;</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>We could both play bo4 on both consoles at same time both online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now it says I don't own the game on my account. And my son can't play online on his console but he can on mine. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the console says is correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your SON bought BO4 with his account. YOUR ACCOUNT does NOT own BO4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOUR SON can sign in on the console YOU want to play on, and set that console as his Home Console, so HIS ACCOUNT can share BO4 to THAT console he sets as his Home Console so you and anyone else playing on that console can play BO4 that your son owns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the other way around: YOUR account has the Gold membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU will have to sign in on your SON'S console with YOUR account, and set that as YOUR Home Console. That way you will share the Gold membership from your account to your Son's console, and he (as well as anyone else playing on your son's console) will benefit
 from your Gold membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really quite simple if you just remember this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONLY ACCOUNTS own games and memberships. Accounts automatically take their game and subscriptions with them, anywhere where they are signed in online, on ANY console in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACCOUNTS can allow ONE CONSOLE to share that "OWNER ACCOUNT'S" games and memberships to anyone playing on THAT CONSOLE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consoles don't own anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you mistyped it in your original post, but for me it read as if you were thinking that games and memberships are owned by "consoles", and by setting home consoles all around your house, the consoles will share among each other, which is NOT the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again:</p>
<p>An account owns stuff. No one else!</p>
<p>The account can allow a console to share this account's stuff to anyone playing on that console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you remember these two simple things, the Home Console sharing should be no problem to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have a hard time to understand the sharing feature, please do ask. We're here to help!</p>

<h2>            Skype beginner in UK</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>I have a MS 365 Home account that I'm trying to link to my Skype account.&nbsp; I don't have a Skype number yet.&nbsp; I don't recall signing up for a Skype account but maybe it does it automatically with MS365 Home.&nbsp; Anyway, I can't change from a US account (seems
 to be default) to a UK account to choose a number and it keeps asking me to make a payment in USD.&nbsp; I should get free minutes with the MS package.&nbsp; I don't seem to be able to log on to anything that is UK.&nbsp; Even this site is English, US (hence my funny spelling).&nbsp;
 Can anyone point me in the right direction?&nbsp; There isn't a phone number to phone Skype, MS support centre said they don't deal with Skype.&nbsp; Maybe I should just throw this all out of the window and go on a mini quest for a phone box with a working telephone
 so I can speak to a human who can help me.&nbsp; Ah...Nostalgia.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopeful of UK</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you mean, you would like to convert your Skype account (created through your Office 365 account) from US to UK? Or you would like to make a payment for Skype number from US currency to UK currency? Do you wish to use UK as default language in accessing
 Skype application or Skype website?</p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information, you are unable to get audio on HDMI TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letâ€™s try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Check if the cables are connected properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab2&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>HDMI
 cables</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>You may also refer the device manufacturer website and try installing the latest version of HDMI audio drivers and check if it helps.</p>
<p>If Windows 8 drivers are not available, then you may install the Windows 7 drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</p>
<p>a. Download the
<span>driver </span>from the manufacturerâ€™s website.</p>
<p>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<b>â€˜propertiesâ€™</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click on the
<b>â€˜compatibilityâ€™</b> tab and check the box <b>â€˜Run this program in compatibility mode forâ€™</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down menu.</p>
<p>d. Click on
<b>â€˜Applyâ€™</b> and click <b>â€˜OKâ€™</b> and run the file to install it.</p>

<h2>            My PC &#40;Windows 7&#41; will not allow me to get online &#40;Internet Explorer nor Mozilla Firefox&#41;. Note&#58; everything is connected &#38; it recognizes network.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>I'm having a problem getting online. I'll start from the report and explain steps I took that haven't worked:</p>
<p>The troubleshooting report is "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection - i.e. the device or resource is not set-up to accept the connections on port The World Wide Web Service/HTTP." As you read-on, you'll see that my internet status says
 the opposite.</p>
<p>I have completly unplugged and re-plugged in my modem and routers and my computer still will not&nbsp;get online.</p>
<p>I have taken my PC to others' houses&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;(WiFi)&nbsp;to login through their connection, but it would not login there either.</p>
<p>Other PCs and iPod Touches&nbsp;have also been able to login through my router - so I know that at have internet access through my house. So the problem MUST be located&nbsp;through my PC (right?).</p>
<p>I suspect a virus MIGHT be at fault because in the lower right hand corner/internet status/set-up connections/etc ALL recognize my Network connection and<em>shows</em> that I have
<strong>complete</strong> access to the internet - despite not being able to&nbsp;open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Please explain to me the steps I need to take in order to re-set my Internet Explorer or whatever other step(s) I need to take in order to get online again.</p>
<p>Thank,</p>
<p>John</p>

    <title>Microsoft Solitaire Collection doesn&#39;t recognise my license - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection doesn&#39;t recognise my license</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a year license for Microsoft Solitaire Collection. However on Saturday (a couple of weeks after the purchase) the Solitaire Collection stopped functioning on my laptop (couldn't connect to server although server was up). I first tried clearing
 data. That didn't work. I rebooted. Didn't work. After all of that I deleted and reinstalled. I signed in with my &nbsp;normal account and it doesn't recognise me as premium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I tried a lot of things, including the step plan named before here, like delete, reboot, wipe cache, wipe store cache etc. This didn't help. Because I really don't like the ads I thought I'd repurchase it then. At least that would keep me ad free.
 But it won't do it. I starts rambling about how I need to reinstall it to refresh my license. So sure enough, did again the steps described above and resulting again in the same result. I'm a sad player now :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody has a solution I haven't tried yet?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Screen orientation on Toshiba Encore WT7 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an annoying problem with my Toshiba Encore WT-7 tablet after upgrading to Win10:</p>
<p>When I rotate the tablet for 90Â°, the screen rotates for 270Â°, so the Picture is upside down. It works normally with both landscape modes, it is buggy only in both portrait modes. I have a Kionix acceleration sensor (up to date with original Toshiba drivers)
 and I just can't find the solution.</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>Toshiba encore mini WT7-16C tablet</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro (Slovenian language)</p>
<p>Kionix 3D sensor with up-to-date drivers</p>
<p>7" 1024x600 multitouch LED screen</p>
<p>Intel Atom QuadCore processor</p>
<p>1GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry for the late reply. As per issue posted, you were unable to get any messages when accessing your account in Windows Live Mail. Let me help you in troubleshooting this issue. First, I would like you to sign in to your email account using a web
 browser to check if your account is working fine and there new messages. If your web based email account is working fine, please pull up your Windows Live Mail and remove your email account and add it again. This is to re-establish the connection between your
 email account and Windows Live Mail. The steps are provided in the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I add an account to Windows Live Mail?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re-configuring the account will eliminate possible connectivity issues. After doing the above steps, pull up your Windows Live Mail and observe for any changes. Please update us with the results. If there are any error messages that occurred, please post
 it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Gta 5 profile sign in problem.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am having trouble playing Gta 5 on my xbox 360. I recently moved to a new house, and we dont have internet yet. Now for some reason, whenever i launch the game, i get a screen after the loading montage that says "you are not signed in, you must be
 signed in to saved your progress and earn achievements". Do you want to sign in now? Y/N. Even though my xbox shows me i AM signed in</p>
<p>if i select yes, it lets me reselect my profile, but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have tried clearing my cache multiple times, as well as moving my profile to a usb drive to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>please help!</p>

<p>I had a similar problem and I never moved to a new location. This was an annoying one, but I'm willing to help you get through it.
</p>
<p>The next time that screen comes up, press Y (Yes). Do you get a box to enter your username and password? If so, do so. The next screen will give us more info. Let us know what that next box is.</p>

<p>Hello Larrick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are using the IP Phone to connect to Teams, right? Based on my experience, you can update the Phone Number in
<strong>Microsoft Teams &amp; Skype for Business Admin Center-&gt;Users</strong>, choose one user and click Edit, you will be able to update the phone number. You can wait for a few hours to let it take effect.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I misunderstand you, please feel free to correct me and let me know the details.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

    <title>Incorrect colors in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Live Photo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deidodei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect colors in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Live Photo Gallery</h2>
                    Both are displaying a different color than what IE, or Google chrome or VLC media player displays. its very very mild and hard to tell if you're looking at photos you don't really look at all the time; but I am looking at my photos I really look at all
 the time and the color is mildly darker. Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Live Photo Gallery displayed the correct colors to begin with when I bought my computer, but not too long ago I recall downloading "VistaGlazz" (a program that allows you to switch to
 WIN XP look) and "TweaksLogon" (allows you to change your logon screen) -- yet, my photos still shown correct in both picture viewers afterwards. It was just one day(about 2 or 3 days after those installations) I was in my colors control center as found by
 menu-clicking on the desktop, and I messed around with the color settings, but did not save them, i restored it to defaults; then all a sudden my pictures displayed either a) A darker color than usual, if it was a dark picture, or, b) a saturated color if
 the picture was light. I will post the photo in specific that I am really seeing the color difference; &nbsp;

</div>
<div>In this photo, you see the first photo is the right color; second as viewed in Live photo gallery (incorrect color.)&nbsp;</div>
<div>the circled regions are where I color-picked them and those arrows at the bottom is the color difference. I know as from here you may not see the difference,</div>
<div>but here is a zoom in on those arrows.&nbsp;</div>

<div>the second arrow is the correct color.</div>

=================================================<br />
Yes...ALL...as in the steps listed under Vista in the following article...<br />
then it will default to sRGB and your colors should improve.<br />
<br />

the display and a color profile when pictures are<br />

<br />
If that does not improve the issue...updating the video drive may be <br />
worth a try:<br />
<br />
May be worth a try search the support sites of your computer<br />
manufacturer and/or video adapter manufacturer for an updated<br />
video driver...<br />
<br />

<h2>            photos app stopped working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: microsoft photos</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to open photos in Windows 10.&nbsp; The default app is Microsoft Photos.&nbsp; The app just&nbsp;stopped working this afternoon.&nbsp; When I try to open a picture it comes up with an error saying "The app didn't start". &nbsp;I have tried to delete and reinstall the
 app, but the uninstall options I have tried cannot find the app.&nbsp; I have searched to find the&nbsp;Photos application file&nbsp;on the computer&nbsp;and I cannot find it, but when I try to reinstall or update the app from the windows store it says the app is already installed.&nbsp;
 There is no way to reinstall it.&nbsp; The app icon is listed in the All Apps list, but when I click on the button there is a brief flash and&nbsp;I get bounced back to the&nbsp;desktop.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, is there a way to I reset the default photo viewer to Windows Photo Viewer?&nbsp; It is a pain to have to go through the right click - "Open With" process to pick a different program every time I have to open a photo.</p>

            Scratch that, just after I typed this. I paused all pending updates and cancelled the update to the Store app itself. The other apps then have updated including the Microsoft Photos app and that has restored functionality.

<h2>            My Windows 10 Installation hangs at 88&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I try to install Windows 10, my computer absolutely stops at 88% on the installing screen. Everything freezes. And it just sits at that screen. I've tried installing numerous amount of times, and it keeps hanging at 88%. I don't know what to do.
 I`m on Windows 7 Professional.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 and whenever I open CMD the first time on a boot up it works fine. If I close it and open it a second time it says "Access Denied" for every command. I am wondering why it does this. Sometimes I cannot restart my computer at the
 moment. I feel like CMD isn't the only program doing this, Steam is doing the same with certain games. Is this just my computer?</p>

            <p>Those scripts involve programs that aren't part of Windows.&nbsp; Windows is not the one giving you the denied error, the error is coming from those executable files (programs) called

 on Windows 8.1 but one day it started saying "Access is Denied"</p>

                    <p>I have had my Dell Windows 7 laptop for 3yrs now. &nbsp;The machine is great and only issue I ever had was I had to replace my hard drive, no biggy, $50 and I did it myself. &nbsp;Now, with the laptop came a free upgrade to Windows 8 but after a bunch of poor reviews,
 I decided to just keep the laptop on Windows 7. &nbsp;Okay, so Windows 10 is coming out now and it is said to be the OS to end all OS's, so I said that I will give a try. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I followed the prompts and installed Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;Install took a lot longer than it should have, but in the end all way done and I was excited. &nbsp;I log-in to my desktop and I walk away for a second. &nbsp;I return and I have a blank desktop,
 can't open anything, can't see anything, what has happened? &nbsp;I am able, however, to maneuver using ctrl-alt-del and then the task manager. &nbsp;I reboot a few times and the same blank screen, can't get to my desktop, after about 2 minutes of being loaded in to
 the desktop comes up and now it is preceded with an "Explorer.exe Application error etc etc, memory could not be written. click ok to terminate." error. &nbsp;I did research all over and no help for this issue, but there is tons of issues with Windows 10, that
 is for certain. &nbsp;I then search for some support, first try I was told 220 minute wait, next time 189 minute wait. &nbsp;Finally, I get someone to chat with me using my now useless laptop and the contact support option under the revert back to Windows 7 section
 under recovery, in settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, now Tech Support Rep Jofelyn has my computer remotely and is doing whatever she can. She toys with it for 45 minutes and nothing. &nbsp;She sets up a call from Tier 2 support for Monday morning, August 3rd. &nbsp;I set aside time in my day and guess what, NEVER
 GOT A CALL, NEVER. &nbsp;Fine, so now I go back to the same contact support under recovery, etc and I get Anne. &nbsp;She tells me she can't help me, go to the answer desk. &nbsp;I go to the answer desk and I am sent to a sales rep, her name escapes me, but she sends me
 to regular support. That is, ONCE AGAIN, a 200 minute wait. &nbsp;I setup a call for 200 minutes from that time and wait. &nbsp;I get a call in about 120 minutes, I was so pleased and SHOCKED. &nbsp;I talk to a girl for 3 minutes, give her my info and she puts me on hold
 and is getting me Tier 2 support. &nbsp;I wait and BOOM, hung up on. &nbsp;That was the last straw, I just went back to Windows 7, my computer is fine and dandy now and will remain so. &nbsp;I would tell ANYONE and EVERYONE to stay away from the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;If you
 have a laptop you want to buy with W10, good or if you want to clean install W10 on your W7 machine, good, BUT DO NOT do the upgrade process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what caused this? Anyone know when this Explorer.exe issue will be resolved? &nbsp;Anyone want to call Bill Gates? This was an OUTRAGEOUS episode and epic fail with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, so like I have written in my original statement, it is very limited in what I can do since explorer.exe crashes almost instantly. &nbsp;I have disable IDT in startup, same issue. I also disabled all audio devices, same issue. I cannot pinpoint the driver
 to remove it exactly. Could you direct me? &nbsp;Once again, remember I need to use the task manager to anything and not everything works even then.</p>

<p>Okay, so renaming the file didn't help, but I was able to uninstall IDT audio as a whole and I restarted. &nbsp;Computer was okay then, but I had no sound. &nbsp;I reinstalled the IDT Sound and it works fine so far. &nbsp;The computer does startup kind of slow but that
 I can remedy with some tweaking. &nbsp;My only remaining issue is that&nbsp;IntelÂ® CentrinoÂ® Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 won't install because there are no drivers that I can find anyway. &nbsp;Have any idea what I can do about that? Thanks.</p>

            <p>I've had a very similar experience with my dell desktop which is only 4 yrs old as of 7/2015. OS was Win7Pro. Now getting all kinds of blue screen errors. Called MS no help, in fact they never called me back. Called Dell and they tell me my expensive 4yr
 old desktop is "END OF LIFE" and they don't carry parts any longer! 4 yrs old END OF LIFE! REALLY! I'll never buy another piece of equipment from DELL ever and I've spent lots of $$ with them over the years. In fact I have a 12.5" convertible I just upgraded
 to windows 10 x2 because the 1st upgrade didn't go well had to reinstall 8.1 and use Media Creator to do clean install. Anyway I digress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to go back to Win7 but first attempt was made from F12 and 2nd disk wouldn't read for some reason. Tonight I'll try from inside Windows, assuming I can PC to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What mess!!!</p>
