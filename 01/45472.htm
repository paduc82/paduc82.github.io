<h2>            Computer password locked and no reset key</h2>
                    <p>I have just recently got my computer back from the computer shop after having experienced a black screen with pulsating blue light. This resulted in losing pretty much everything off the computer and having it returned by the repairer as factory release,
 or whatever a newbie is called. My computer also came back with one month free trial of Trend security (as I had lost my security software as well) which I changed, after a couple of weeks of research to Bitdefender (which I have necer used vefore). &nbsp;After
 having done a vulnerability scan etc , Bitdefender said my password was weak ( I did not know what it was referring to as I know longer was using a password, since my computer when returned from the computer shop no longer required one for access), I think
 I must have inadvertently clicked on something, in an attempt to get bitdefender off my screen. To be honest, who knows what I clicked on I was rushing.The point is my computer now wants a password. . Which I do not have. . How could I (it will not take my
 previous password of 3years) . . Nor did I or do I have a reset disk. . I have no idea what to do. . .Not the computer shop again. . Will they just wipe everything again and charge me a fortune. HELP PLEASE IF YOU CAN.</p>

            If you have little experience at a maintenance level then you are facing a difficult predicament. I suspect that you will need the assistance of a computer-savvy friend. Drop me a note (pegasusDOTfnlATgmailDOTcom) to discuss the matter off-line in greater
 detail.

    <title>Bioshock 2 - PC and Windows LIVE problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slcjonathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bioshock 2 - PC and Windows LIVE problem</h2>
                    I have purchased Bioshock 2 for my pc. When you hit START GAME, Windows LIVE has a drop down that ushers you to create an account profile (it wont let u save the game if you dont).&nbsp; I have created a profile, went to my email and confirmed it, added to
 my profile to see if that was the case, which it wasnt. <br />
<br />
I have since tried to start the game and log in to Windows LIVE (yes, my username email and password are correct because I've went to the actual site and tried them), it brings&nbsp; up a window that says its "Downloading content, do not close the game", I wait
 approx 10 seconds then an icon appears briefly at the bottom of the screen that says "Disconnecting from LIVE" then it pops up an error message that says "The provided Windows Live ID is not associated with a LIVE gamertag, would you like to create a LIVE
 account?"<br />
<br />
How am I supposed to get this to work, I have called every tech support number I can find in the web and not one person can help with this issue, I am very frustrated.
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I have just tried relogging and when it asked me if I wanted to create an account, I clicked yes this time to maybe make a different profile, it took me to http://live.xbox.com (I am not playing on an xbox I only have a PC, to restate), I have even tried
 clicking at the top of that page that says "Join Xbox LIVE - Free" to see if I need a profile there and it takes me to a screen that shows the "sign up for free" vs "sign up for gold" but when i click on the free all it does is route me back to the afore mentioned
 web address.<br />

<p>Hi SLCJonathan,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I’d suggest you to open your live ID account in one tab and then try playing that game. Now if it takes it to live.xbox.com website, that website uses that live ID, you need to just enter its password that it. If you don’t have you live ID account open then
 it will ask you to enter live ID. Now enter the live ID and click on Sign in button.
<br />
<br />
I would also recommend you to contact that game support team to find out if there are any patch’s for that game.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App and Yahoo Mail</h2>
                    I installed Window 10 and added my yahoo mail account to the Mail App.&nbsp; I have two problems:&nbsp; 1) I can't create folders in Windows 10 mail to sort my email and 2) anything I send from Windows 10 mail does not show up on my mobile device or at yahoo.com

<h2>            Windows Media player won&#39;t play songs I just ripped from cd&#39;s that I bought</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I've been having an issue with Windows Media Player ( the one that comes with Windows 8.1). So here's my problem, I've ripped a couple of CDs ( one of them a recent release) and my media player plays some of the songs in the individual albums but it will
 not play a few that I really want to listen to. I've checked into the error and it says that I may be missing a codec to play the song. I've tried to figure out which codec it is but I have no idea what I'm looking at.&nbsp; ( The Error Reads Windows Media Player
 cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device. There might not be a sound device installed on your computer, it might be in use by another program, or it might not be functioning properly.) Please help I don't know what else to do,
 I don't understand how this could be- considering this is still a newer version of windows for me.&nbsp; I don't know how to update the WMP or how to even locate the area that it's in to do so. Please help!
</p>

            I'm not surprised you are confused! It does not sound like a codec issue. Do you still have access to the CD discs in question? If so what happens when you insert them and try to play the tracks directly from the disc?

No error messages, it shows the device, but even with special startup option that ignores the device signing, it still wont install. I'm currently working on a workaround (<a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a>),
 but seriously, when you pay for an operating system you shouldn't have to trick your operating system into working with all your devices.<br />

            <p>You can replace the missing CopyOEMInf.exe file from another operating system and re-start the program or reboost your computer. In most cases, you still need to register the file to Windows Registry, which stores all the information of Windows configurations,
 settings and third party program information. Re-installing the program and reboosting your computer may resolve the error and fix the associated Windows Registry issues. However, you could further damage your computer in case you're not familar with Windows
 Registry and failed to edit the associated Registry entries correctly.</p>

            Follow-up :- I tried the following link and it work. No messing around, and no need to sign in with device signing turned off. Just select which one you need for your operating system, download and click on it. It self extracts and works straight away.
 One of the guys in SD support sent me the link.<br />

<h2>            Xbox randomly makes eject noise and turns on.</h2>
                    I honesty have no clue what going on with the my xbox. Originally I was gifted an Xbox one on my birthday 2 weeks ago then out of nowhere in the middle Of the night all I hear is "ding ,ding.,ding," wake up too go look and my Xbox is ejecting the cd in
 &amp; out and shutting on and off. So I just unplug the console and left it alone for half the day. Fast forward a few hours later and my cd randomly ejects as I'm playing. So right there I just turned off everything threw the Xbox in the box it came with And
 went straight to the store I brought it from for a refund/warranty. The nice clerk just basically gave me a brand new Xbox and said sorry about the problem and I said it's fine things happen. That was 4 days ago! Now today I'm sleeping and what do I hear?
 "Ding ding ding ding ding" the Xbox randomly ejecting again. I don't know what to do at this point anymore? I can't be that un lucky to get 2 Xboxs that were bad out the box back to back in a matter of weeks! Worst thing is that I'm

<p>I'm sure the preview team would be interested in the issue your having and they really are the best place to get help and give feedback.</p>
<p>Do you have your xbox plugged directly into a wall socket? Plugging in via an extension cable has been know to do some odd things.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Recieved when running the HP Quality Center application after logon successful</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on my Lenovo laptop. When running the HP Quality Center tool, I can successfully login but I get a blue screen after the login in 2-5 minutes. The error reads: Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. STOPCODE Unexpected Kernel
 Mode Trap. Then it automatically restarts kicking me out of the HPQC tool. This only occurs when running the QC tool. I have tried to reset my settings on the PC and have run a scan. All were completed but the error still occurs. The error message reads that
 it possibly is a motherboard issue. How do I diagnose further to pinpoint exactly what is broken? If I have to bring it to a repair shop, where do I go?</p>

<p>No, and the same thing's been happening to me since the 23rd or so. The problem appears to be on HP Enterprise's end - since even

<h2>            Microsoft Fix it hangs on resolving problems</h2>
                    I get an error whenever I go to Windows update and cannot get any updates. So I tried using the Microsoft Fix-it tool and it just hangs at resolving problems.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<div>I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</div>
<div>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to place your computer in clean boot and try installing&nbsp;the updates&nbsp;and check.</div>
<div><strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>
Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state
After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run</strong>.</li><li>Type <span>msconfig</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
The <strong>System Configuration Utility</strong> dialog box is displayed.</li><li>Click the <strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>
Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.</li><li>When you are prompted, click <strong>Restart</strong> to restart the computer.</li></ol>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>What update are you talking about - a Windows Update or some other update?&nbsp; Try uninstalling it to see if that resolves the problem.&nbsp; If the normal uninstall doesn't
 work, try Revo <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong> the
 problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device
 Manager by going tostart / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts
 or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get them for your video card at least and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so
 from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Keep me posted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>Physical code cards purchased in stores may have an expiry date unless they are printed on a seperate store receipt, If you purchase a code directly through microsoft then theres usually not an expiry date of when you need to enter the code, You are allowed
 to have upto a total of 3 years of xbox live gold on your gamertag.</p>

<p>Try to uninstall the “HID-compliant mouse” driver that has a yellow mark on. After that, restart your computer and let Windows install a generic driver for your device.</p>

<p>Hi Venancio,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the original post, installing and uninstalling the driver was one of the first things I did and it did not work at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the mouse is working now, even with the duplicate HID-Compliant mouse in Device Manager with one of them still cannot start (code 10). the previous suggestions may have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this issue is considered resolved or not, but as of writing, the mouse is clicking away for a couple of days now.</p>

<p>Code 10 or greyed out in a device property means the OS see's the hardware,but it needs software/driver install to work..Also,in device mgr, you should see "Human Interface Devices"</p>
<p>this is from Microsoft &amp; one can edit for preference.</p>

<h2>            Bonjour services  error</h2>
                    
<p>I know this has probably been covered in another forum post but I have not found it&nbsp; but I keep getting errors for Bonjour services&nbsp; ###: Error&nbsp; read_msg Errno 10054 (an existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.) this is for bonjour services.
 from what I understand it has to do with Iphones and printers. my computer is not connected to or using either. so I have really 3 questions.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; what exactly is Bonjour services?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Do I really need this for a stand alone system that will not be using any printers or iphones/ pads or anything like that? (this is computer is strictly for online gaming)</p>
<p>3 if I do not need it how do I turn off the service? or at least disable it so I do not keep getting errors in my log from it?</p>

<p>It is a DNS Transponder service installed silently with some Apple software (such as ITunes) and some Adobe software (such as any of the CS3 SC4 series etc)</p>
<p>See&nbsp;the link to the thread below for how to stop the service.&nbsp; If you do stop the servive, be aware that it may cause issues with some of the above.</p>

<h2>            Idle timer in Task Scheduler</h2>
                    In XP was able to set Task Scheduler to launch a custom user logoff program after 5 min idle. When trying to set up a task within Windows 7 Task Scheduler, 5 min idle does not work. Any suggestions, it appears to work after 15-20 mins idle.

<h2>            Slow Shutdown&#47;Logout&#47;Restart</h2>
                    <p>My PC takes several minutes to logout, restart or shutdown. I've tried using the MS tool that traces shutdown (I can't find it at the moment), but it found no items that wait more than a second or so. Despite this, it sits and appears to do nothing for 6-8
 minutes before finally shutting down... There is no disk activity after abuot 10-15 seconds, so it looks like it's just waiting on something to time out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone assist with where to start looking. Are there tools that trace "everything" Windows does or waits for during shutdown/logout?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reloading the PC is beyond where I want to go at the moment due to not having several days to reload and reset all applications and settings or a second PC I can use while resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>That actually made it even slower! Which is not surprising as according to MS, setting it to 1 causes Windows to clear the file at shutdown which takes longer than not clearing it.</p>
<p>

<p>I can't find the options you mentioned. In PC Settings, I don't have "Recovery", only "Update and Recovery". If I go in there there is a "Recovery" option, if I go into it and click Restart Now under Advanced startup, the PC ries to restart immediately and
 I don't get any options coming up.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Explanation of &#39;sync Microsoft password&#39; function&#63;</h2>

            If you use the sync then when you use your Microsoft account across devices\platforms it will sync your saved passwords.
<br />They are the ones that are in credential manager.
<br />So if you go to search and type credential manager and open it those are the passwords that get synced. 
<br />I have it turned on and like it cause when i go to sites that require logins it will find my synced password and i don't have to type it in.
<br />
<br />But be careful cause this will store passwords on your machine and you need to make sure you are securing your login properly.

            Hi Jeremy 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Check whether the contact is blocked by you by mistake
<br />
<br />Right Click on the contact / Chat &gt; View profile &gt; Scroll down and at the end you have Block Contact
<br />OR
<br />Click 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Contact &gt; Blocked contacts &gt; Here you can unblock
<br />
<br />2. Check whether your caller ID is set up or not - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>? 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.
