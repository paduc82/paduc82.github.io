<h2>            Computer Shuts off once Unplugged</h2>
                    <p>So my computer says my battery is at 95%, plugged in and not charging. However the computer shuts off the moment I unplug the power cord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the following things to attempt to fix:</p>
<p>1) Uninstalled all battery drivers and reinstalled them.</p>
<p>2) Shut off the machine, removed the battery. Rebooted with only power cord, then shut off insert battery and reboot.</p>
<p>3) Run a battery report</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery is only 2 months old and has approximately 60 charge cycles. So it in theory should not be to the point where it needs to be replaced.</p>

            Yes, you should have another year or more of life in the battery.  But it is like any other hardware, prone to failures. 
<br />
<br />Check to see if you can find a local store that specializes in all sorts of batteries. Contact them to see if they can test your battery to check it's condition.

            See if you have a local Batteries Plus store. They specialize in replacement batteries and may have the testing equipment Ron mentions.

<h2>            programs and features tool displays installed programs incorrectly in my windows 7&#40;Home Premium&#41; laptop.</h2>
                    I am using windows 7 home premium since last 3 years. There are about 90 to 100 programs installed in my laptop. But the "Programs and Features" in the control panel is showing only 28 programs. All the programs and&nbsp;software's are working properly. But
 when I tried to uninstall a program which r not listed in the "programs and features" it is not possible. What is the solution for this?

<h2>            Bluetooth services not listed</h2>
                    I have 2 computers with the same problem.<br />
Computer 1: Emachines, Vista Home Premium w/SP2<br />
Computer 2: Home built, Vista Ultimate w/SP2<br />
I am trying to set up Bluetooth so I can connect Bluetooth devices. I plug the Bluetooth adapter into a USB port, I get the popup that the computer has found new hardware, I get the popup that the new hardware is installed and ready for use. This is all pretty
 normal. I open control panel and click on Bluetooth devices. I click on Add new Devices. Nothing happens. I open up Microsoft Management Console and check services. There is no Bluetooth Support listed. I have 2 Bluetooth Adapters. Both give me the same results.
 Both of these adapters will work in my laptop that has Vista Home Premium w/SP2. I have tried some of the related solutions, but none of the ones I have seen in this forum are that close to my problem. Any suggestions?

<p>Problem resolved. I had tried several times to update driver using device manager. Each time it would respond that the best driver was already installed. I went to the Broadcom web site, downloaded and installed a driver. Now everything works. Botton line-
 it was a simple driver issue. I was putting too much faith in windows device manager in finding the correct driver. I appreciate the efforts of you folks in helping me to resolve this issue.</p>

<h3> justasking3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Fax with Windows Fax &#38; Scan</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 &amp; can't send a fax with Windows Fax &amp; Scan. My phone line is plugged into my desktop modem. I entered the recipient fax number on the cover page, attached a document, clicked Send and the message just sits there, in the outbox, "pending."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The "resume" &amp; "restart" options (in the right-click menu) aren't available. I tried sending another fax to a different number (my brother, whose line I knew was open and available) and the same thing happened: the message sits in the outbox, pending.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before I upgraded to my current desktop, I had different Fax software with more features. It let me click different buttons, one for when my phone line was being used for voice, another for when it was used for faxing. (That software also acted as a voicemail,
 saving incoming calls as sound files.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Fax &amp; Scan doesn't do that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have one phone line. When I tried faxing, the phone was hung up. I didn't try faxing while talking.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yet still the messages are "pending."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me why? And what needs to be done to fax?</div>
                </div>

            My modem was properly set up &amp; connected.
<div><br />
<div>I had 15 Chrome tabs open &amp; had watched a few YouTube videos. After closing my apps &amp; rebooting, Windows Fax &amp; Scan tried resending the faxes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Even though I have a quad-core processor with 4 GB RAM, WF&amp;S wouldn't work because something in RAM blocked it. When RAM was cleared by the reboot, WF&amp;S tried again to send the faxes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems WF&amp;S needs close to virgin RAM to work.</div>

<h2>            Files on mounted volume don&#39;t appear in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Win 7 Pro 64 bit. &nbsp;I have a 256 GB SSD that is in two partitions of 128GB each. &nbsp;The second partition is a mounted volume as C:\My Documents. &nbsp;Sometimes I am browsing in a folder under \My Documents and the some or all of the files don't show
 in Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Often just the temp files in the folder show. &nbsp;Sometimes many subfolders won't show. &nbsp;Often these are files or folders I haven't visited for a while. &nbsp;It seems like there is some kind of caching going on with mounted volumes. &nbsp;If I start
 from the C: drive in Explorer and navigate down, everything shows up. &nbsp;But I shouldn't have to do this. &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,- bill.</div>

<p><strong><span>Hi rohit solanki,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Proxy server settings are used to tell Internet Explorer the network address of an intermediary server (known as a</span><span><span><em>proxy
 server</em></span></span><span>) that is used between the browser and the Internet on some networks. Changing proxy settings is something you usually only have to do if you are connecting to the Internet through a corporate
 network. By default, Internet Explorer automatically detects proxy settings. However, you might need to manually set a proxy with information supplied by your network administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So actually the server will change but the browser remains the same.</span><span>A browser or
<span>web browser/</span> I<span>nternet browser<strong> </strong>
</span>is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the world wide web. For Microsoft the default browser is Internet Explorer which you can use on the operating system to connect to different servers or proxy
 servers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

    <title>L2TP Protocol&#47;Authentication - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            L2TP Protocol&#47;Authentication</h2>
                    <p>Please help as I am going mad!</p>
<p>I have a user who had a L2TP VPN, with a preshared key, confirgured on their machine which was working fine.&nbsp; It started throwing up a security error and failing to connect.&nbsp; When I checked the settings the protocol settings had been removed so I switched
 it back to encrypted connection only, PAP protocol and clicked save.&nbsp; I then went to the VPN settings and noticed that the authentication had changed from Username and password to general.&nbsp; Now if I go in to the VPN advanced settings and click edit and change
 the authentication back to username and password it then removes the protocol settings in VPN adapter settings.&nbsp; If I leave the authentication it fails to connect.</p>
<p>I have tried with a windows 7 machine using all of the same credentials and it connects to the VPN no problem?</p>

<p>The VPN connection is authenticated by a Meraki MX60 firewall using username and password.</p>
<p>I have identified what the issue was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>even though I need to set the protocol to PAP and then set the authentication to username and password, it now does remopve the protocol settings but it must now try each protocol when establishing the connection.&nbsp; But previously it did keep the protocol
 setting?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Method 1 sais "The problem cannot be diagnosed with Troubleshooting"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 cannot be used. Movies &amp; TV cannot be uninstalled and reinstalled, not through a right click on its tile and its Move and Remove buttons are disabled in Settings, System, Apps and Components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be trying Method 3 next. I added another Microsoft Account to the computer, but even though the newly provisioned account will show a progress bar to download and/or install Movies &amp; TV, it will produce the same errors when opening a video from File
 Explorer.</p>

            Neither of these methods work. The last one merely confirms it is not a problem with my user account, but rather with the computer or the app.

            <p>I've been fighting with this problem trying to resolve it and with the Store in general, since the fixes proposed didn't produce results at first. I've had success wrt Movies &amp; TV, but now I have lots of other apps that don't work anymore, so I'm at a loss
 and still need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movies &amp; TV seems to be fixed which is great, but now I have problems with Maps, Scan, Reader, Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, AppTemplate (whatever that is, it shows up in Start), FlowFree, Age of Empires: Castle Siege and a series of apps that show as @{[PackageName]/?ms-resource://[Family]/resources/AppName}
 in Start. Some of these can be uninstalled, others cannot. Some of those I uninstalled&nbsp;cannot reinstall because the&nbsp;Store sais they are installed, even after running wsreset.&nbsp;Some start but crash before they accept interaction, others don't start, show no
 tile or icon, show the PackageFamilyName in notifications that still come in, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's lots of distinct questions in the community about this, with varying error codes and symptoms and I'm wondering what could be done to diagnose this and fix this array of problems people are experiencing, since I believe it just shouldn't happen.
 Isn't that the idea of Appx in the first place, that the install, detection, uninstall is super reliable, simple and fast?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I arrived here since my first post in this thread?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most importantly, I've ran wsreset, the Troubleshooter for Windows Apps and the PowerShell snippet containing
<strong>Get-AppxPackage | foreach Add-AppxPackage -Register</strong> and it didn't work. Rather, I received mostly errors about registration errors with a pri file mentioned in the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The particular problem with Movies &amp; TV seems to have been resolved by running
<strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong> <strong>/Source:Path-To-10.0.10586.0-Iso
</strong>since it failed using only Windows Update as the source. It found a massive number of problems with directory ownership (unowned but specifies SDDL&nbsp;or duplicate ownership) and it replaced opencl.dll as the CBS.log indicates (see below) There might
 have been other fixes, but the log is quite lengthy.</p>

</p><p>I can find several references to&nbsp;0x800f0805, but they concern W7. I ,also, cannot find any references to 304#####-#########. The closest I can come is 303#####_#########.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS Support and sfc was executed with the above results. Of course, they could fix it if I wanted to get Advanced Support ($$$$$). I guess I could do a refresh, and re-install my programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestion before the refresh is done?</p>

            What does (redirect) mean to you?<br />
<br />
Does that mean you use Internet Explorer and choose Tools, Windows Update and don't end up on the Windows Update page?<br />
<br />
If that is the case, where does it go instead?<br />
<br />
If your browser takes you to some place other than where you want it to go, the is a sign of a malicious software infection as the malicious software does not want you to go to the Windows Update page because it does not want you to find it and remove it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sometimes the malicious software will prevent you from going to many other sites where you might find tools to remove it (it knows about these things).&nbsp; The malicious software would be happiest to fool you into thinking that the only solution is for you to
 reinstall your XP from scratch, do a Repair Install or use a System Restore point (but that will not make you happy).<br />
<br />
If you mean something else, try to explain things a little better and follow these instructions:<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still... I will run the suggested tools to make sure.</p>

            Hmmm... I am not sure what that might be.&nbsp; Usually redirects go to advertisement pages or pages some folks my find offensive.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that if you use Internet Explorer (what version are you using) and click Windows Update, you end up on that page for KB2497281?<br />
<br />
Did you install any antivirus/antimalware programs after the fresh reinstall and if so, what?<br />
<br />
Did you download SP3, install it from a CD or other?<br />
<br />
Male sure XP thinks you are on SP3 by clicking Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Long shot:&nbsp; Using Explorer, navigate to this folder:<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc<br />
<br />
In explorer, under Tools, Folder Options, View, enable "Show hidden files and folders".&nbsp; You are looking for the normally hidden text file called 'hosts'.&nbsp; Open the hosts file with notepad or wordpad, select all the text. copy and paste all the text back here.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, someone will kick in with some other ideas.<br />

<p>Yes, also by using Start &gt; Windows Update ... I end up on the KB page. The first URL&nbsp;I see appearing&nbsp;is</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it redirects immediately after that...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No antivirus installed so far... Because I jus reinstalled and the first thing I tried was the Windows Updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SP3 was downloaded using the link on the KB page I get redirected to...</p>

            <p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the full name of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>3. Open Add/Remove Programs &amp; make sure the Show Updates box at the top is checked. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2555917, KB2507938; KB2530548, KB2544521, KB2544893, KB2476490, KB2535512, KB2393802 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows XP" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed, two will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>====================================</p>

            <span>What version of Vista do you have (including SP number).&nbsp; I have 32-bit Vista Business SP2.&nbsp; Something is messed up in your system files to cause this type
 of problem.&nbsp; The spooler isn't deleted (at least I don't think it is though it could be corrupted).&nbsp; We'll systematically check everything until the only option left is a system repair/upgrade (which&nbsp;would take hours).<br />
<br />
Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time <strong>
BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any
 software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista
 Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</a>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the
 screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using <a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</a>&nbsp;along with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures
 don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need
 to make a slipstream disk as follows: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>WIFI disconnecting&#47;disappearing after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albatrosas  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIFI disconnecting&#47;disappearing after Windows update</h2>
                    Hello, I have an interesting problem that I need help solving.<br />
<br />
The short of it is that at random times my home WIFI disappears. Like, if you look at the available other networks, it is not there. It would appear again after a few seconds to a few minutes. This happens a few time a day, but sometimes it doesn't happen at
 all. I tried it on other WIFIs and it doesn't seem to be causing problems, however, I just tried for a few hours, which I don't think would suffice for testing it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am pretty sure it is a Windows 10 issue, or at least a windows related one, as this issue started occurring after I updated my Windows maybe a month ago.
<br />
<br />
I tried digging up solutions, but I couldn't find anything that would resolve the issue. The things I tried so far:<br />
- Making sure that the device doesn't go to sleep/ gets powered off by windows<br />
- Updated my network drivers<br />
- Tried the windows throubleshooting<br />
- Restarting the laptop<br />
- Setting WLAN Auto Config to Automatic<br />
- Making the connection Private<br />
- Disabled Hotspot 2.0<br />
<br />
I don't believe that it should be antivirus related issue, as all the people that I asked have different antiviruses, and some don't even have one.<br />
<br />
The only other solutions I could find that I haven't tried yet are to reinstall my network adapter, set the WIFI as a metered connection, and reinstall windows.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if it would make any difference but my router is Technicolor TG799vn v2. The router itself should actually lose connection as it has an uptime round 5 days and I have experienced the issue several times the day before. I have set the channel to
 13 as this one is the least active for my region. And there are just 3 devices connected to it - 2 laptops and a phone.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more info and if I should try doing some of the things I haven't yet tried.

<h2>            How to install JAVA on Windows</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />The JAVA Runtime is one of the most popular web browser&nbsp;plug ins used on numerous websites to power applications used in banking and gaming. Windows does not bundle the JAVA Runtime, so the user will have to&nbsp;download and install it from Oracle.com. In
 this article, we take a look at the quick and easy steps install it on Windows 8 and later. Please note, you should only install JAVA if you need it, since it can be used as a targetted vector for malicious attacks.
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>The first thing you need to do is determine which version of JAVA you need to download for your copy of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version of Java should I download for my 64-bit Windows operating system?<br />
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_win64bit.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_win64bit.xml</span></a><br />

</strong>Scroll through the list of installaed programs<br />
Select JAVA and click <strong>Change/Uninstall </strong>on the command bar<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
</li><li>Disable&nbsp;your&nbsp;third party Antivirus you might have installed prior to updating.</li><li>Do a clean boot. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />
<br />
</span></a></li><li>Reset your web browser to its default factory state and try again.<br />
In Internet Explorer, click Tools or Alt + X<br />
Click Internet Options<br />
Go to the Advanced (tab)<br />
Under Reset Internet Explorer settings, click 'Reset'<br />

hi<br />
try opening itunes setup in compatability mode.<br />
right click on itunes setup and select properties. Tick 'Run this program in compatability mode for'<br />
and select Windows 7 from the dropdown list. By the way try installing the latest version of itunes from the apple's site.<br />
Also a 64bit Itunes canbe used only in a 64 bit windows OS.<br />
Goodluck..

            <p>Try downloading iTunes again, but instead of running setup from its current location, try saving it to your hard disk then run the setup file.</p>

<h2>            I need help following KB3080351 &#38; MS Answer Desk is clueless</h2>
                    <p>I want to permanently block Windows 10 upgrade prompts on my Windows 7 Pro X64 computer, and there is an article KB3080351 that gives steps to do the blocking:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot follow the steps for any of the methods listed:</p>
<p>Group Policy</p>
<p>Computer Configuration</p>
<p>Windows Registry</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not part of a Group, and I don't understand how to get to Computer Configuration.
</p>
<p>So that leaves only the Windows Registry instructions,&nbsp;and I have never had problems with using Registry Editor in the past. But the instructions state:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">To block the upgrade to Windows 10 through Windows Update, specify the following registry value:<br />
<br />
Subkey: <strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate</strong><br />
DWORD value: <strong>DisableOSUpgrade = 1</strong></p>
<p>However, when I&nbsp;navigate in Registry Editor&nbsp;to <strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\&nbsp;
</strong>- there is NO WindowsUpdate listed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can find the WindowsUpdate in the Registry?</p>

            <p>Some Windows 7 editions (Home Premium, Home Basic and Starter) don't come with Group Policy Editor (GPE).&nbsp; Only Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate editions come with Group Policy Editor installed but the registry is the same...&nbsp; Even if your
 version of Windows doesn't include GPE you can still control GPOs via direct registry edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do not exist in the registry until after the GPO is enabled or changes state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That key you seek will not exist in the registry until you use Group Policy Editor to "turn on" the setting, then the key is created and stuffed with the correct DWORD (or you could create the key and DWORD manually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your Windows version has GPE, click the Start orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>group policy </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select 'Edit Group policy' and navigate to here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Windows Update</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Locate the '<span>Turn off the upgrade to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update' setting, double click, Enable it and click OK to save the settings:</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Exit GPE and then you will see the key in the registry has been created (right?&nbsp; right.):</p>
