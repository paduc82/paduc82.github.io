<h2>            Microsoft basic optical mouse 2.0 wheel scroll switches direction</h2>
                    <p>When scrolling up or down using the mouse wheel, after 3 or lines of scrolling the direction of the scroll with switch. For example when scrolling down, it will scroll down correctly 3 jumps, and then it will start scrolling up (even though the wheel is
 still being being scrolled down). Then it will go all the way to the top, and then switch again and scroll down 3 and then scroll back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on Windows 7 (64-bit), even on a clean install before installing updates. It is also not specific to any application, the behavior exists in all browsers. I have tried updating, re-installing the drivers. It only ever happens with this particular
 mouse.</p>

            I already did, but because I'm usually able to figure things out, and this time I couldn't, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask the community. I'm interested in figuring out what this is and perhaps help someone else having the same problem.

<h2>            Why does Windows 8 Suck so Much&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What I use to be able to do on previous versions of Windows, I can't do on Windows 8. When I download a file, I want to move it to a specific folder; with Windows 8, it is a very difficult task requiring many steps that I didn't have to take before. There
 are a host of other things I use to be able to do, but now it is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should fire the idiots who designed Windows 8.<br />

            <p>All versions of Windows since 95, and the ease of moving a file you want to download to a specific folder is no longer possible; it requires two steps where before it took one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can move files around in Windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>You took away the Start menu, (8.1 Start menu isn't the same) you took away Free Cell. You created more steps to do the same task as before. Opening Windows Media requires 3 steps, and if there is a way to create a short cut, I can't find it. It sucks so
 bad, I understand you are bringing back the Start Menu in Windows 10. Will I be able to upgrade for a minimal cost? Will the "new" upgrade be as good as Windows 7 or Vista?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid good money for Microsoft Office Standard Edition 2003, I can't use it with Windows 8. You did this to force people to re-buy the same product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several months ago I purchased a new computer from Dell and it came with Windows 8, and from the very first day it has been a terrible experience when compared to previous versions of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, what you have done is dumped the entire Windows experience and replaced with a system that is totally alien to what you had before.</p>

<li>You can move files around in 8/8.1 the same way as in previous versions.</li><li>The Start menu being gone is the most complained-about missing feature, I think.&nbsp; I agree that it was a mistake.&nbsp; I corrected it&nbsp;for $5 by getting Start8.&nbsp;
</li><li>Free Cell: Microsoft Solitaire Collection, free in the Windows Store. </li><li>Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center?&nbsp; Neither is more difficult to open in 8/8.1.</li><li>Shortcuts are created the same way as in previous Windows versions.</li><li>All software will become obsolete at one point or another.&nbsp; While I can't say that Microsoft's motives were completely pure with regard to old versions of Office apps, I can tell you that things will always reach a point where advances in the OS will result
 in obsolescence of old software. </li></ol>
<p>If you install a third-party solution to add a start menu and do what you need to do from the desktop rather than the "Modern"&nbsp;GUI &nbsp;(which does have its merits), you should find that what you have is nearly identical to what you're used to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I don't claim to be in the center of things, but I do know a lot of people in the tech world, and to date, not one of them has had a nice thing to say about Windows 8, only complaints. You had a system that everybody with PC's understood and could work with;
 Windows 8 destroyed that relationship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Office 2003, did they even try to make it compatible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should I pay $5 for Start 8? It should be an option freely available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the games, I did go to Windows Store, it is not the same thing. Maybe things have changed since the first time I was there, but why should I have to go there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened with Windows 8 is your team moved to last place in the league.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure there are people who love Windows 8, so what? I know people who love the Oakland Raiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Windows 10 is going to restore many features that were available in previous versions of Windows. Good idea to go back to the old playbook, it worked.</p>

            <p><strong>As for Office 2003, did they even try to make it compatible?</strong></p>
<p>Office 2003 is now 11 almost 12 years old now. Most companies do not support products more than a couple years old. If you want a compatible Office program, you can update to at least Office 2013. I realize that some people think it hasn't changed at all
 but it's a lot of under the hood improvements. For example, in older versions of Outlook you had to manually specify the SMTP and POP3 settings for your e-mail. Now in Outlook 2013, you type in your e-mail address and Outlook finds the settings for you. It's
 smarter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Store is also the place to go for games and apps. There's WAY more selection that you had than previous versions of Windows and many of them are free.</p>

            <p>That's ok, I downloaded&nbsp;<span>Apache</span> OpenOffice Writer, it is free and works as well as the Microsoft Office software that I purchased from Microsoft. Wonder why Microsoft didn't provide a free update so it would be compatible with Windows
 8? You have a point about having to set the SMTP and POP3 settings one time with the old Outlook, it is good to know you can avoid that difficult one-time task and the new Outlook does it automatically. Have used Outlook at work and at home, now I just use
 my original Yahoo email and have everything set up the way I like it, works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, you guys have convinced me that Windows 8 is a great operating system, much better than the ones that came before it. It is easy to understand and made things much simpler.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's big mistake, imo, was Vista, in which perfectly useful things in XP were changed for no apparent reason, with the mistakes being sustained in Windows 7 and 8.&nbsp; &nbsp; One that comes immediately to mind is the XP Scanner and Camera wizard, which provided
 an excellent method of importing image files from digital cameras and storage media.&nbsp; People migrating from XP to Windows 8/8.1 are understandably befuddled by much of what they see, more so than those who took the intermediate steps of using Vista and Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, if you stick to the desktop and sort of ease your way into the Modern interface, you will find that (a) Windows 8.1 isn't that much different from 7, and (b) what
<em>is</em> different is better in most cases.</p>

            <p>It wouldn't be so bad if when you clicked on Start it took you to a page with columns and very small icons with titles next to them. What I read is that 8 was designed for tablets, based on the idea that everybody was going to abandon their towers, and it
 didn't work that way. And, yes, I do know you can make the icons smaller, but it is not the same. I want lists, not icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the little things that bother me. Like having to enter a password to get to my desktop every time I boot my computer. I understand there is a programming way to get around this, but again, why should I have to do this, shouldn't it be a simple option?
 Besides, I have my password taped to the bottom of my tower just in case I forget it like I did with my cell phone password to hear messages (after a few days, I remembered).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to the store and looked at games, I just don't like what they are doing and asking. Terms of Use, and an application that has Privacy issues. I don't like having to jump through hoops to do what I had always done; play Free Cell, and sometimes
 Minesweeper, and occasionally Chess. 8 is the only version of Windows that I know of that didn't include games in its original setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like how icons appear on my task bar. Some icons stay after I close the program and I have to unpin them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have read, 8 is a very stable system. I have to agree, have not had a single crash since I've owned it. Had it for several months now, maybe more.</p>

<p>Microsoft is on the ropes and hasn't kept up with how people use computers today. Everyone else has evolved, but they thought they were to big for other options to take their market share.... Surprise! The people have spoken. I regret ever investing in another

            Do you have a USB 2.0 card to test? A user in my msfn.org thread also had USB issues, which were solved by disabling the build in USB ports and using a PCI USB card.

            <p>This did not work for me, however, I think I may have discovered the original problem.</p>
<p>When trying to download windows, the Wi-Fi network that I was connected to stated the file size exceeds the maximum limit allowed (I'm using Wi-Fi at work).</p>
<p>It would have been nice for Windows to detect this from the beginning instead of vaguely telling me to "check network settings".</p>
<p>I'm going to try downloading via a different network or just use my cellular data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How big is the file, anyway?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Requested a call, but no longer need it. Can I cancel it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I requested a call from Microsoft support for an issue I was having with making a purchase. Turns out though, just signing out and back in resolved the issue. Is there a way to cancel the call request, or should I just wait for it and tell them I don't
 need their help anymore?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>kwl. Not just 8. The only issue is only 20% of my friends have an Xbox 1. All my best friends play on Xbox 360. I like the animated avatar idea too. It helps make the dashboard look less Windows 8 and less square box tooooo formal.

<p>I have a Hauppauge HD PVR2 which I got at the start of last year. It records game and party chat on Xbox 360 and Xbox 1. I did a PVR recording of Forza 6 Tag Virus but my PVR recorded those in game chat, because I was doing a lets play of Forza 6.
</p>
<p>Xbox 1 I'd say, is still experiencing software issues sometimes. Last night my Kinect was plugged in yet the Dashboard wasn't picking it up. I restarted my console and it was working again. I don't think it's hardware issue, because Xbox 1 has pretty good
 hardware, an EIGHT CORE processor and 8GB RAM. I've gotten some friends involved in my Youtube videos. It's easy to be in a full party on Xbox 360 because it only accepts 8 as the limit, but only 20% of my friends have an Xbox 1. But it's great to see them
 increase the limit for Xbox 1, since it has better hardware compared to last gen, and it has 300,000+ XBL servers worldwide, to connect to.

            <p>I like WinZip. I abhor the junk that they've now included with their main programs.</p>
<p>You can uninstall this from your PC with no ill effects.</p>
<p>I'm moving your question to the Performance and Maintenance topic for Windows XP from the Virus and Malware topic area.</p>
<p>You can uninstall WinZip Driver Updater from your computer by using the Add/Remove Program feature in the Window's Control Panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <span>Start</span> menu (for Windows 8, right-click the screen's bottom-left corner), click
<span>Control Panel</span>, and then, under <span>
Programs</span>, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Windows Vista/7/8: Click <span>Uninstall a Program</span>.</li><li>Windows XP: Click <span>Add or Remove Programs</span>.</li></ul>
</li><li>When you find the program <span>WinZip Driver Updater</span>, click it, and then do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Windows Vista/7/8: Click <span>Uninstall</span>.</li><li>Windows XP: Click the <span>Remove</span> or <span>
Change/Remove</span> tab (to the right of the program).</li></ul>
</li><li>Follow the prompts. A progress bar shows you how long it will take to remove WinZip Driver Updater.</li></ol>

<p>Hey forums team! I just got off the phone with XBL. A few days ago, my xbox stopped reading my discs. I went through the trouble shooting steps and the problem persisted. Because my warranty had ended, they suggested I buy another xbox. I followed their
 advice and immediately went on eBay to purchase a replacement. To my disappointment, when I tried to sign in to play XBL (I'm super psyched about double xp nuketown 24-7) it said that the console had been banned. Once again I called the support team and they
 told me that you guys had more tools than they did and that I should join the forums. Please help?</p>

<p>Actually no, the forums for connectivity are just normal users, and a banned console can't be undone as far as I know at all, but at a minimum not by anyone here. You'll want to post in the suspension forums.
</p>
<p>However like I said, console bans are detected mods in the harware and wind up being 1 way trips for an xbox.</p>

<p>they suggest you buy a new console not one off of EBAY</p>
<p>taking a risk at buying a USED console is dangerous </p>
<p>what you will have to do is take it up with ebay or the seller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is what extended warranties are for</p>

            <p>You might want to check the manufacturers website for an updated driver that supports Windows 7 or at a minimum Windows Vista. If not, its probably best you look into purchasing a new device that supports Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try compatibility to see if that will work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#39;active signal resolution&#39; is 1200x1920. when display resolution is 1920x1200</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem when I want to play dungeon keeper, the screen resolution changes. If I consult display settings I notice that 'active signal resolution' is set to 1200x1920 and the screen rotation is set to 270 degrees clockwise so effectively I get a
 display resolution of 1920x1200, but when I run DOSbox only 2/3rds of the screen is visible and a message slides across informing me that the display resolution should be 1200x1920.</p>

<p>Are you sure you bought the right map pack? Because the Rezurrection map pack was released only for Black Ops 1. Black Ops 2 currently doesnt have map packs available. If you meant Black Ops 1 in the title of the post, then I have no idea. So.... the map
 pack is only for Black Ops 1..... Sorry if you spent microsoft points on accident....</p>

            Recently, I've been having problems downloading email from my personal email from my website. &nbsp;It's a dot.com email that is hosted by godaddy as part of my website package. &nbsp;I can download email from their webserver, but recently, when trying to view with
 Windows Live Mail, I receive an error message that is the following:

            <p>Hi Tonya Williams,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for not being able to reply to your post in a timely manner. I would be glad to assist you so that you may download emails from your other account in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that this issue can be broken down into two causes. They are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) <span><font color="#000000"><font>– Kindly check with your provider if it is required or not.</font></font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) <span><font color="#000000"><font>– It could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</font></font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>I recommend that you reconfigure your account by removing the account then add it again. Please refer to the article, How do I add an account to Windows Live Mail, that was provided by the previous moderator.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Issues with printing from any of the applications on Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with printing from any of the applications on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Printer Problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having extreme difficulty with retaining the ability to print from any of the applications on my computer. Yesterday, I could print anything from any application. Today, without my doing
<em>anything</em> to the computer, I am back to the no print zone. Specifically, when I execute the print command in Word, Nitro PDF Reader, Firefox, Thunderbird, Google Chrome or any other applications, the application becomes nonresponsive. I have to go to
 the task manager to shut down the applications. I have updated all the drivers and used a variety of diagnostic programs to no avail. I had no problem with printing when I was using Windows 8.1. Does anyone know of a solution to this problem? It has me to
 the point that I am going to go back to Windows 8.1. In the OS, at least everything worked. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I followed the steps you recommended. However, the problem still comes up. So, I went in and set my HP wireless printer as the default printer. It now prints. However, I have identified another printer related problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Nitro Reader 3 as my default PDF program. It had a driver which gives the option of converting a document (within a browser window) to a PDF document without actually printing the document. It worked flawlessly in Windows 8.1. However, when I try to
 use it with Windows 10, the browser freezes and must be closed using the Task Manager. Furthermore, the crash stops all other printer functions. I have run many of the Windows diagnostics to no avail. I have run the diagnostic you recommend, but it states
 that all the drivers are up to date. In order to avoid another crash--and another hour-plus involvement in frustration, disgust, and upset--I have started using another PDF printer driver (Corel PDF Fusion). It works differently, but it does not crash the
 programs or change my default printer settings. Are Nitro Reader 3 and its components compatible with Windows 10? If it is not, please direct me to another free PDF reader (other than Adobe) which will provide me with a full range of PDF abilities similar
 to those offered by Nitro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your response.</p>

            <p>Hello.&nbsp; I'm having printer issues as well after upgrading to Windows 10. My Brother HL-1230 printer is no longer is listed as a printer.&nbsp; I've gone to the Brother's website to download the printer driver, but it says it's included with Windows 10.&nbsp; I've
 already tried following their instructions several times, and the printer doesn't detect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried following the above Method 1: it doesn't direct&nbsp;me to somewhere with instructions on how to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried following Method 2, and because the printer driver doesn't show, I can't update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?&nbsp; The printer was working perfectly prior to the update...</p>

            The last driver available from Brother for your printer was for Vista.&nbsp; Using the built-in Windows drivers is always a sketch proposition for old hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the built-in driver doesn't work for you, you're going to need a new printer or an older operating
 system. <br />

            download the vista driver...<br />
start windows 10 with driver signature check disabled. you can arrange this with clicking on "settings", "updates/security", "recovery?", "new start?"...<br />
windows must somehow find the printer, it will be showed up in the device manager with a question mark and the correct name...<br />
right click on the printer and choose "update driver" in the device manager...<br />
choose the extracted drivers...

            Thank you for helping.&nbsp; Somehow, I haven't been able to disable the driver signature check though.&nbsp; It sounded so promising.&nbsp; The options on my computer don't match the ones listed.&nbsp; I guess I'm not tech savy enough.&nbsp; Appreciate you taking the time though.&nbsp;

 came out cause the laptop to switch off soon after I load it up.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if your system requirements match the game's system requirements?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you also tried installing the latest updates for your video card drivers?</li></ul>

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Pull the bottom two sliders down to the minimum
<br />
<br />That should reduce your upload bandwidth usage . . .

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Adviser. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Steps to reduce upload internet bandwidth: 
<br />- Open Settings.
<br />- Click on Update &amp; Security.
<br />- Click the Advanced options link.
<br />- On "Advanced options," click the Advanced options link.
<br />- On "Delivery Optimization," click the Advanced options link.
<br />- Under "Download settings," check the Limit how much bandwidth is used for downloading updates in the background option.
<br />- Use the slider to specify (in percentage) the amount of bandwidth you want your device to use.
<br />- Under "Upload settings," check the Limit how much bandwidth is used for uploading updates to other PCs on the Internet option.
<br />- Use the slider to set (in percentage) the amount of bandwidth you want to dedicate for uploads.
<br />+ If you want to limit the amount of data your device uploads per month, you can also check the Monthly upload limit option.
<br />- Use the slider to set the upload limit 
<br />
<br />Refer here for more details:

<br />
<br />
<br />If its not enough to control, you can use software programs designed to limit the upload speed.
<br />
<br />Try NetLimiter (<a href="http://www.netlimiter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.netlimiter.com/</a>).
<br />With NetLimiter, you can see your running programs and apply a DL/UL limit to any of them
<br />
<br />or try 
<br />Netbalancer (<a href="https://seriousbit.com/netbalancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://seriousbit.com/netbalancer/</a>) 
<br />NetBalancer is an internet traffic control and monitoring tool, with loads of features to:
<br /> - Set for any process a download and/or upload network priority or limit.
<br />- Manage priorities and limits for each network adapter separately Define detailed network traffic rules
<br />- Group local network computers and balance their traffic synchronised
<br />- Set global traffic limits.

<h3> ghost1982  say:</h3>
<h2>            mobile hotspot not staying</h2>
                    <p>Hi with my desktop computer I use the mobile hotspot feature to get wifi in another area of the house that my modems wifi doesnt reach the issue I'm having is that it turns off after a few minutes or when not in use. I need the mobile hotspot feature to
 stay on permanently as it is not practical to come back and turn it on every other minute. Is there any way to do this? Or do I have to stick with Anniversary update and put up with the creators update constantly trying to install?</p>

            Well thats crap why on earth would you make something so unusable? Is there no registry hack or anything like that I can do to change this as it is very serious problem for me at the very core of my set up? The problem is my third party app baidu wifi
 cannot share an internet connection with the creators update, nor can any other third party app that I've tried, so the creators update is completely unusable with my set up yet it keeps trying to force itself upon me, I have no option to defer it and have
 disabled windows update through services but every other day it tries to download and install itself how do I stop this?

            Thats going to be a pain in the ass until I find a third party app to get around it I cant use the creators update, which actually I would like to have on that computer. You wouldn't know of any compatible apps that allows me to do this on windows store
 or else where, from what I've seen creators update is still to new.

            The problem with connectify is it doesn't stay on permanently for free like my existing set up does. Why pay for something I get for free now? I'll have to upgrade to test the other option sounds like a pain in the ass to set up every time I boot compared
 to the one click I have now. Thanks for info.

<p>Hi Eduardo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern regarding the graphics card not functioning properly when using a specific application can be caused by an improper configuration or a possible outdated driver. As an initial step to ensure that your device is set to perform on its optimal level,

<em><strong>Power Options</strong></em>.</li><li>Click the <em><strong>Additional power settings</strong></em> link.</li><li>Under <em><strong>Choose or customize a power plan</strong></em>, select <em>
<strong>High performance</strong></em>.</li><li>Restart the device and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the even that you encounter the same issue, our next step is to ensure that the display driver is updated. To do this, follow the steps provided on this

<h2>            Your user profile was not loaded correctly...event log... Windows can not delete the profile directory</h2>
                    
<p>Peridodically (about 3-4 times a week) the standard users on our computer will get the following error.&nbsp; "Your user profile was not loaded correctly.&nbsp; You have been logged on using a temporary profile.."&nbsp; As instructed I checked out the event view and found
 a number of errors related to the User Profile Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most coherent one states that "Windows cannot delete the profile directory....This error may be caused by files in this directory being used by another program."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The work around is to restart the computer.&nbsp; I am in search of a better solution.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
1. Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
2. Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

</span><br />
3. Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />
<br />

<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup.<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth) has been<br />
known to cause this issue.<br />

<br />
BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />
<br />
DO NOT USE THE HIDDEN ACCOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS! If it corrrups you are TOAST.<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password (or<br />
two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
