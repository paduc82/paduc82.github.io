    <title>Hidden administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hidden administrator account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed windows 7 for my mum on a new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She really likes clicking things without thinking so I put her on a standard user account, enabled the administrator account and then hid it from the log-on screen with a registry edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was expecting that UAC would ask me to confirm anything dangerous by asking for the admin password. It does ask, but there is nowhere to type the password, it is impossible to authenticate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot edit the registry to 'unhide' the admin account, I can browse the registry but removing or editing the value is met with a could not complete error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safe mode does not show the admin account on the login screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have I locked myself out?</p>

Under Windows XP you could press Ctrl+Alt+Del twice in order to log on under a hidden account. Under Windows 7 this option is no longer available. Hiding the one and only admin account is not a good idea.
<div><br />
<div>To prevent your mother from logging on under an admin account you should use the standard method of arranging for an automatic logon, bypassing the password prompt. The command
<i>control userpasswords2 </i>is the traditional method.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running a machine with a single admin account is as risky as having just one house key (unless you enjoy smashing a window). In these forums we deal on a daily basis with users who lock themselves out of their machine for one reason or the other. See
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/corrupt-administrator-profile-account/051aa0ec-8eb4-491c-a09b-98c2e85272fc#LastReply">

            <p>I was expecting exactly that behaviour in windows 7 to display the hidden account.</p>
<p>I don't see why this has been removed. What benefit does removal provide?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic logon sounds like a terrible idea, and it doesn't really stop anyone from doing anything. The admin account is password protected, I was just trying to tidy up some loose ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think you can apply the analogy of having two house keys:</p>
<p>Things like this were never an issue in XP.</p>
<p>Windows 7 goes out of its way to stop someone locking themselves out at a high level, requiring always one admin for example, but on a low level no protection exists, it seems pretty lazy.</p>
<p>Hiding an account from the logon is impossible without disabling the account?</p>
<p>ctrl-alt-del is disabled on the login menu?</p>
<p>What is the point on carrying around two house keys when the lock is broken?</p>

<p>&gt; If you allowed me to sit in front of your PC then I would be able to log on under an admin account within less than five minutes, without using a password cracker. It's novices who get stopped by passwords.</p>

<p><i>What is the point on carrying around two house keys when the lock is broken?</i></p>
<p>&gt; I do not carry two house keys. I left one with a neighbour. It's an emergency measure. If you are happy with a single admin account then this is fine with me. BTW - did you read the post at this link?<br />

Chill out, what is your issue? I'm sure there are plenty of skiddies that can run a live usb and blank out a password.<br />
<br />
The point is not keeping out pro hackers like you seem to be, but to stop her phoning me once a week when she logs out for no reason and then tries to log back into the admin account and cant because shes trying ot put her own password in and hasn't realised
 its the wrong account.<br />

Yeah, windows breaks sometimes, thats what i said. How many extra accounts do i need to litter my computer with before i'm safe from all possible bugs?<br />

I digress, the point was that windows 7 sucks<br />

<h2>            Updates</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure what the hold up with you guys are. But, what do you expect with Microsoft right? Anyways on to my issue. I have not seen a Skype update with you guys for almost 6 months now, and I do check for updates on daily basis. Here's what's going to
 happen, if no new updates are not going to be pushed soon. I am going to switch to Discord, and forget Skype all together, and use the Skype account through Discord, if updates are not pushed soon. I am tired of you guys not doing updates faster, and not fixing
 a load of issues with Skype it's nothing, but a resource hog, and makes people's computers lag like crazy because you dummies do not how to fix squat. Okay I am done venting/ranting now hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick Voege</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If, I get some useless out of you guys you have lost a user for good I am not sitting, and arguing over some troubleshooting BS that isn't going for me, or others that is all have a nice day.</p>

            <p>Thanks you for you answer Uttam. I had not seen this until now, and did not receive any notification that there was an answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact your response proved correct because 24 hours later, in desperation I tried again and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But why oh why do we get silly error codes which mean nothing to the uninitiated instead of a message such as "Unable to contact registration server, please try again later" ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Secondly, all the other points raised have not been answered, so I still have no confidence that if there is a problem in future there will be any kind of support available.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand of course that this roll-out is occurring on a massive scale, but then Microsoft understand that too and should prepare accordingly. What's the point having facilities to download 16 updates per second if you don't have the capacity to process
 a similar number of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, the most bizarre aspect of it all was that the update started without my active acquiescence. Having been offered an alternative time of day to do the upgrade, I was trying to make up my mind whether to put in a date some time in the future. Then
 a message appeared saying I would need to restart my machine for updates to be applied. I decided that this must be the normal regular updates and that I had better do that first. As it turned out, it was the W8.1--&gt;W10 upgrade so this occurred before I had
 taken any precautions whatever. This was a most uncomfortable situation. &nbsp;As it happened, apart the failure to register at the end, the upgrade itself went flawlessly, but Microsoft managed to spoilt what would have been a tremendously good piece of work by
 the problem at the beginning and the problem at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Roger</p>

            I think ive found a lot of my trouble but i hope you will let me know. My ISP settings had me set on private network and i changed that by unchecking the box so now i guess im on public from my ISP but please let me know if this is the right thing to have
 done. I do know that I took off double NAT when the&nbsp;problem&nbsp; was discovered and boy its like a different world on the old PC now. Again I appreciate your good peoples advise so much. God Bless!

<h2>            Clock&#47;Time out of sync whenever I cold-boot up Windows 8</h2>
                    Whenever I cold-boot up Windows 8 Pro (64-bit, US English), I notice that the time shown on the bottom right hand corner of the desktop shows is always about 1.5 hours behind my set time zone.<br />
<br />
The above error does not happen when I do warm-boots, ie. restarts.<br />
<br />
The error started showing up about two days ago.<br />

Could it be due to a virus/malware/Trojan horse or a faulty CMOS battery?<br />

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sounds like it could possibly be an incompatibility with the <strong>Fast Startup</strong> component. Perform the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Open
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span></b> / <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Power Options</span></b>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Left side menu, select

</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Change settings that are currently unavailable</span></b>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Scroll down to the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Shutdown settings</span></b> section. </span></span></li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Remove</span></span></b> the check mark from the

                    <p>Windows 10 mail app has an option for sending and receiving mail via SSL. Problem is it has never worked. It gives the message that the certificate is out of date (which is dumb), then an error message.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, help us with the exact error message/code which you receive when trying to send the mail via SSL.</p>
<p>As initial troubleshooting step I would request you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><span>&nbsp; </span><strong>Run the App troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>This tool will help to fix the issues automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Check Date and time settings.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The store app uses https instead of http which is used by other apps, so in order for the SSL handshake to proceed, the clock on the client and server needs to be correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify that your computer is configured with the correct date and time settings, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Date, Time, Language</strong>, and <strong>Regional Options</strong>, and then click
<strong>Date and Time</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Date &amp; Time tab.</strong></p>
<p>4. Make sure that the <strong>date and time settings</strong> are configured to use the<strong> current date and time</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Kindly update the status of this issue, we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks. There's no problem found using the trouble shooter, and the date and time are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the problem be that my mail server is in the US while I live in Australia? That is, the date and time on my computer will be different to the date and time on the mail server. If so, that would constitute a bug and maybe that could be fixed by Microsoft?</p>

    <title>Cross-adapter Clone with NVIDIA and Intel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yotvb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross-adapter Clone with NVIDIA and Intel</h2>
                    <p>I have an NVIDIA graphics card on my laptop, in addition to the onboard motherboard graphic card (Intel).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Months ago, NVIDIA decided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone mode across graphics processors is handled by the Windows 10 OS and not by the NVIDIA driver. Consequently, there are no controls for cross-adapter clone mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel under Windows 10.
</li></ul>
<p>Ever since NVIDIA made that change I haven't been able to clone my laptop screen to an external monitor. It seems NVIDIA pulled support for cross-adapter cloning, because it's supposed to be natively supported in Windows 10, yet I can't find the option to
 do it natively inside Windows 10. I also can't find any forums related to this topic and it seems no one is talking about it. This is a HUGE problem, since I haven't been able to clone to a projector or TV for months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else know how to fix this?</p>

<p>
Anyone else know how to fix cross adapter cloning? Everything worked perfectly in windows 7, 8, 8.1.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clone mode across graphics processors is handled by the Windows 10 OS and not by the NVIDIA driver. Consequently, there are no controls for cross-adapter clone mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel under Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, you can follow the below link:</p>

            <p>That's what I copy-pasted in my original question. My post here is to ask how to do it natively inside Windows 10. Since NVIDIA no longer handles the cross adapter cloning, how is it now accomplished?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it Intel's fault for not providing it on their end, or is it Microsoft's fault for not yet adding the capability to the OS?</p>
<p>Doing Win+p brings up the side menu where I can choose clone, but it never ends up displaying anything on the secondary monitor.<br />

            <p>This is a serious issue until it is fixed in Windows 10, hopefully soon! </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possibility &nbsp;is to disable completely the Intel &nbsp;graphics adapter, and only use the Nvidia card to clone your display to an external monitor. At least this works for me. &nbsp;</p>

            Go into the HP compuer BIOS and find "Hybrid Graphics" or similar option. Check documentation for your version and sett it to only use nVIDIA. That way the conflict between the Intel Driver and nVidia is avoided.<br />
My problem with 2 external monitors was that Windows 10 recognized both, Intel control panel the one and nVIDIA the other. Changing the bios de facto disabled the Intel adapter and everything works OK.

<p>This is not a correct fix for the problem from the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This simply disables Optimus and all power savings are lost until the user enters the BIOS to re-enable Optimus.&nbsp; This is not exactly good for presentations when the laptop is often used w/o AC power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have this issue and have had it since (IIRC) The first Creator's Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have reloaded the OS from scratch to make sure it was not a Fast Ring Problem.&nbsp; Now it only has the Microsoft provided drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I found that DxDiag finally detects the Nvidia NVS420M when A) the Display is extended or B) when the 2nd display is selected from (Win+P or vendors Fn+F8).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>DxDiag does not detect the Nvidia NVS420M if the laptop LCD is selected or if no external display is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duplicate displays does not work. Period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under normal use (i.e. no external display connected via HDMI).&nbsp; DxDiag does not work NOR does any program utilize the NVS420M for video processing as displayed in&nbsp; Nvidia's "Display GPU Icon in Notification Area" option, DxDiag, or various program specific
 monitoring tools.&nbsp; Graphics performance is also on par with ONLY the Intel GPU's expected 3D performance (poor at best).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Nvidia's control panel does not display any information about the Intel display adapter nor any display connected to it.&nbsp; At the same time, the Intel control panel does not display any information about any other adapter or display other than the LCD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is most likely due to the use of non-Optimus versions of these two drivers or versions that do not properly detect certain (dated?) hardware configurations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer that the original working drivers for Windows 10 be made available until an up to date fix is obtained.</p>

<p>Q2: How does Xbox LIVE know that a player is cheating to change their Gamerscore?</p>
<p>A2: We look for abnormal achievement and Gamerscore activity by using criteria that identifies users who have used external means to earn achievements without actually playing the game. Users who play games legitimately to earn achievements are unaffected
 by this review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still see EARN in there. If you mod it you don't EARN it. This (as well as many other parts on
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../973429</a> say the word EARN).</p>
<p>Sooo... Basically they reset you if you earn them.</p>

    <title>Gaming chair help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgt flaps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gaming chair help</h2>
                    
<p>I really need help if possible.. Hope you are all well :D&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I bought a second hand gaming chair today, (X Rocker Jet).. This chair came with no cables so I have had to buy an adapter to plug it in the wall which is fine. Now the dilemma that I have got, how to go about setting up the audio.<br />
<br />
On the X1 there is an Optical Output (As u all know)<br />
On my TV there is an Optical Output and a 3.5 mm output.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The input on the gaming chair is 3.5 MM..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I have come to the conclusion that I can either use a 3.5mm to 3.5mm.. Or I can get an optical converter to convert the HD audio back to standard audio&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Would there be any difference in doing either?<br />
<br />
The only reason I am confused, is because is the manual it shows a setup for portable devices of 3.5mm to female red and white, then a red and white male plugged in to the female with a 3.5 plugged in to the gaming chair, can't understand why they didn't just
 plug in a 3.5 to 3.5 and be done with it?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much all.<br />

<p>Yeah the RCA red and white are what almost every TV uses for analog stereo output. It's pretty rare for a TV to have a 3.5mm stereo output jack. Just get a long enough 3.5mm male to male cable and you should be all set plugging your chair into your TV. Then
 just set the Xbox One to stereo out for HDMI and you should be all set. Getting a HDMI audio adapter to pull the audio signal out to 3.5mm or an optical to 3.5mm converter would really be overkill just for a stereo sound gaming chair.</p>
<p>One other way is if you have a headset chat adapter you can plug one end of the 3.5mm male to male cable into the chat adapter and the other into your chair. This way the audio would come wirelessly to the controller and then into the chair. Might not be
 as clear as a direct cable to your TV and will drain the &nbsp;battery on the controller a bit more since it's receiving audio.</p>

<h2>            High CPU usage after HP printer installation</h2>
                    My computer runs Windows XP. When recently installing an HP printer my computer failed to complete the installation from the CD supplied.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then noticed a dramatic slowdown in computer speed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I uninstalled the HP from the disk and was able to install the printer via the HP website.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since then my computer has been very slow when starting. Upon checking the task manager I noted that Explorer.exe sometimes uses up to 100% of CPU. How do I fix this?</div>

            <p><span>What is the CPU and how much RAM does your computer have? Right click on the My Computer icon on your Desktop and select Properties to get this information.</span></p>
<p><span>Try Ctrl+Alt+Delete to select Task Manager and click the Performance Tab. Under Commit Charge what is the Total, the Limit and the Peak?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would be interested in seeing a Disk Defragmenter report. Open Disk Defragmenter and click on Analyse. Select View Report and click on Save As and Save. Now find VolumeC.txt in your My Documents Folder. Open the file, and place the cursor anywhere
 in the file, select Edit, Select All to highlight all text and copy and paste into the body of your message. Do this before running Disk Defragmenter as it is more informative.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Event Viewer Reports</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding
 the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.</span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. You will see a button resembling two pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. This places a copy of the report into your Clipboard.
 Paste into the body your message. Make sure that this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous
 session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting
 better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

<h2>            Keinen Zugriff mehr auf Xbox Live</h2>
                    <p>Ich habe mich schon in Verbindung gesetzt mit dem Microsoft Customer Service, jedoch wird mir geraten einfach ein neues Konto zu erstellen.&nbsp;</p><p>Ich habe seit dem 14.06.17 keinen Zugriff mehr auf meine E-Mail und dementsprechend auch nicht mehr auf meinen&nbsp;Live Account. Angeblich kann man mich nicht als Inhaber identifizieren. Falls ich keinen Zugriff mehr auf meine Mail bekomme, wie kann ich dann meine Inhalte bei Xbox, meine Gold Mitgliedschaft und meine gekauften Erweiterungen etc. behalten bzw. auf ein neues Konto wechseln ?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Transfering programs from an old to new computer</h2>
                    I used "Windows Easy Transfer" to get all programs and data to a new computer.&nbsp; The data files were copied, but application programs&nbsp;were not.&nbsp; Some support files and folders came across without the executable files.&nbsp;
<br />
Old computer OS=XP Home.<br />
New computer OS=Vista Home Premium, 64 bit.<br />
Is this normal for Vista?<br />
Must I reinstall each application?

<p>Programs have to be reinstalled on the new Operating System; it is nothing to do with it being Vista.<br />
<br />
When the Programs were originally installed on XP, it was put in Program 'files, registry, etc. in conjunction with other programs that they would be working with.<br />
<br />
It is normal, and they have to be reinstalled.<br />

<p>One of the greatest challenges you face after purchasing a new computer is transferring personal files, e-mail, data files, media, and settings from your old computer to the new one. This process can be so complex, time-consuming, and daunting that people
 frequently request help from friends or relatives, and some never succeed in getting all their important data onto the new computer.</p>
<p>Windows Vista significantly simplifies this important process and makes transferring personal data easy and intuitive.
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/easy-transfer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Visit the Windows Easy Transfer website.</a></p>
<p>Windows Easy Transfer is a wizard that helps you transfer the data that is important to you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User accounts</p>
</li><li>
<p>Files and folders</p>
</li><li>
<p>Program data files and settings</p>
</li><li>
<p>E-mail messages, settings, and contacts</p>
</li><li>
<p>Photos, music, and videos</p>
</li><li>
<p>Windows settings</p>
</li><li>
<p>Internet settings</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Programs (applications) are not transferred.</strong><br />

            1. I had pasted the screenshot from the new version only which has Send button. Can you click on 3 horizontal dots on top &gt; About this version &gt; Let me know the version?
<br />
<br />2. Click on your picture on top &gt; Beneath your picture, it will show your name and Skype Name / ID.
<br />
<br />To see your address, scroll down &gt; Click Manage account

            My apologies. Currently, switching off Enter is not offered as the functionality.
<br />
<br />This is possible only in Classic Skype but Classic Skype is getting sunset and after 1-Sep-18, Classic Skype can not be used.

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

                    <p>I have my COA number (on the package the Windows 7 64 bit sp1 came in) but when peeling off the sticker that said Microsoft, it destroyed the PRODUCT KEY. I bought the Windows 7 Professional from Newegg software (Windows 7 64 BIT SP1 OEM license). It is
 now installed and I'm installing my software just fine.</p>

            <p>Contacted NewEgg and they have heard of the issue before and for me, they are allowing a swap out. They said some customers were successful using rubbing alcohol to loosen up the glue and then were able to remove the label. I think these products must have
 been sitting a 100 degree warehouse somewhere to make the adhesive break down like that. The software installed but I found the issue when I went to activate it.</p>

<h2>            Skype&#40;microphone too low&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After a very recent windows update(yesterday), when I started a call on skype, my microphone didn't seem to work properly, even thought it worked fine( being just a bit low from time to time), but now it just doesn't work properly, with me only being able
 to speak when really( like really close) to the microphone.</p>
<p>This didn't happen I tried to contact someone via another program, making me think that the problem might be connected to skype (which might be wrong).</p>
<p>I would like to know if possible, what is probabaly the problem and what solutions do I have.</p>

<p>I managed to fix the issue.</p>
<p>I went to sound and noticed that probably after the update my microphone intesity was reduced to 0 somehow. I put it in max and it worked.</p>
<p>What I still find strange is that I could speak on another program, even with this issue, but not on skype. Thats what set me off, thinking that the problem was not directly connected with my pc.</p>
<p>Still thanks for the reply and for trying to help out.</p>

<h2>            disk check</h2>
                    Did a disk check and it kept shutting down in the final 5 out of 5 situation. Turned on computer again and again and it kept bringing disk check in at the beginning of the process. Had to get into a reboot situation with some difficulty to overcome it.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Let us try these steps to disable the auto check and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Method 1:</font></span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
<br />
You may try the steps to disable autochecking.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
<br />
a. Click Start then type <b>regedit</b> in the Start Search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>b. Right click on
<b>regedit.exe</b> and then click "<b>Run as administrator</b>".</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>c. Expand the "+" to the following keys.
</font></span></p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</span></b></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>d. There is a value here called
<b>BootExecute</b>. If bmssldr is listed in the data section then remove it.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If not follow these steps, the default value of the key is autocheck autochk *,* means every drive is checked for consistency.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>e. Just add /<b>K:C at the end before *</b>. /K switch will disable autocheck on C: drive at Windows startup. So the final value should look like this:</font></span></p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">autocheck autochk /k:C</span></b></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&gt; If you want to add more drives, the key should look like this: (disabling C and D drives)</font></span></p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">autocheck autochk /k:C /k:D *</span></b></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&gt; If you want to restore everything to default, just replace the key with the default one i.e.,</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>autocheck autochk *</font></span></p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
Important:</span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> The above mentioned steps tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.<br />

Method 2:</font></span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you may try running a check disk from Windows recovery environment.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
<br />
You may try to run check disk command from WINRE using Windows Vista full version disc and check if it helps.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
<br />
a. Insert the installation disc.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>b. Restart your computer.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>c. When you are prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For
 more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>d.
<strong>Choose</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>language settings</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>e. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Command Prompt</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>f. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER.</font></span></p>

<p><font><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</span></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><br />
g. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.</font></span></p>
