<h2>            Can&#39;t get past Welcome screen in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I had my computer working perfectly until a recent update (February 22). After it installed/applied the update, I tried to log in, but clicking the mouse and typing any key on the keyboard didn't make the initial block screen move. I restarted it forcefully,
 after which I was able to type in my password. But after doing so, the "Welcome" sign, with the little spinning dot circle, stays there forever. It stayed spinning for about two hours, after which I tried to boot the computer up with F8. I tried every option;
 system restore, system refresh, everything but the system reset, which would delete all my files, and I have important ones. None of that works. I have no installation disc either, because I bought my computer (a laptop) with Windows 8 already in it. It's
 about 8 months old. I also tried to do an Automatic Repair, which takes about 15 minutes and changes absolutely nothing. I can't even boot into safe mode; when I try that, all it does is show me a black screen that stays there

<p>Which phase?&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have a boot prompt to go with it?&nbsp; Depending on the phase I would try pressing Shift-F10 or Ctrl-Alt-Delete.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So at least you can see some boot options.&nbsp; Then you can get into the Command Only boot and change your boot options there.&nbsp; For example, try using Low Resolution Video as an option.&nbsp; Another way to achieve the same effect might be to force use of a generic
 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, some users have found that the black/blank screen symptom really only means that they are seeing the unused second half of an Extended display, where the primary screen is a phantom monitor.&nbsp; In that case it may be possible to simply assume what you
 would be seeing on the other screen and act accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the simplest procedure to try then would be pressing Win-P, CursorUp, and Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It&nbsp;would help to clarify your symptom description.&nbsp; Is the screen really black or just blank?&nbsp; E.g. if you can see a mouse pointer moving on it and a fringe of light around the edge I would call it blank, not black and then that could make such workarounds
 as I described above more hopeful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there are probably some boot diagnostics which could be invoked here but haven't had to use any.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that most of them are intended for developers who have attached monitoring devices to capture the extra diagnostics but it's possible that there would be additional external effects that could give you more clues by enabling them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have an extremely slow Restart from W8 to W7, so I can try watching it more closely for more ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could also try enabling&nbsp; xbootmgr&nbsp; xperf&nbsp; tracing for more ideas.&nbsp; Unfortunately I doubt that it is feasible to enable such tracing before
 you can at least get your OS running normally.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot change the background of an image on your Movie Maker. If you made changes using
<strong>Visual Effects</strong> on your photos, the whole photo will have the effects. You can view what Visual Effects has to offer when you open your Movie Maker and click Visual Effects on the upper left part of your Movie Maker window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Does your photo not fill the whole screen in movie maker?&nbsp; So you have a background colour showing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make your photo the size of your movie, so if you are making a 1920x1080 HD movie, either crop your photo to that size, so it fills the screen or add a border to your photo of the colour you want and ensure the canvas size of the new photo is the size of
 your movie, so you have a cancvas size of 1920x1080, (landscape)&nbsp;black background (or colour of your choice)&nbsp;and you add a portrait picture to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this needs to be done in your photo editing programme, like photoshop, before importing into MM.</p>

            <p>Movie Maker will just take your photo dimensions and shrink them so it fits vertically (or horizontally) within the project area. If the aspect ratio of the photo doesn't match the aspect ratio of your movie, you'll end up with black space around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skier-hughes has given a possible workaround which is to edit your photo and add your own color/frame/etc. around the outside of the picture so that it matches exactly with the aspect ratio of your movie. Another option is to actually crop your image (in
 an image editing program or in Photo Gallery) so it has the correct 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Then there will be no space around the photo at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any specifics on the size of your image (horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions) along with the aspect ratio of your movie? What is the "original color/background"? Can you post a sample of the issue you are having?</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for using Windows 8. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the Windows Experience Index issue. I would like to know few things before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </div>
<div>2. What is the make and model of the computer? If possible, provide us the speicification of the computer.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>The Windows Experience Index </strong>measures the capability of your computer's hardware and software configuration and expresses this measurement as a number called a base score.</div>
<div><br />
If the base score is not getting updated: </div>
<div><br />
<div>If the base score is not getting updated, these could be some of the reasons.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. <strong>Not enough free disk space</strong>. The Windows Experience Index assessment tool creates a test file on your hard disk.
<div><br />
b. <strong>The assessment is already running</strong>. If the Windows Experience Index assessment tool is already running, your scores can't be updated.</div>
<div><br />
c. <strong>The display driver is older</strong>. If your computer is using an older version of the display driver, your scores might not be updated. For more information, see Update drivers: recommended links</div>
<div><br />
d. <strong>No multimedia support</strong>. If your computer doesn't have multimedia support, your scores can't be updated.<br />
<div>e. <strong>Running on battery power. </strong>Windows automatically tries to conserve power when running on a battery alone. So if your computer is running on battery power, a performance assessment won't reflect its true capabilities. Plug your computer
 in, and then re-run the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform Disk cleanup and update hardware drivers and check the status.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>: <strong>Run Disk Cleanup</strong></div>
<div>a. Press Windows <strong>Key + X</strong> key and click Control Panel.<br />
b. Go to the <strong>Control Panel </strong>and then open <strong>Administrative Tools
</strong>and click on <strong>Disk Cleanup.</strong> <br />
c. Select the <strong>drive </strong>and click on <strong>OK.</strong> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>I would suggest you to update the computer with the latest drivers before attempting another and check if it helps. Especially Graphicsa adapter, please follow the steps to update graphics driver.
<div>&nbsp;
<p><span>Try updating the graphics card drivers and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to update the graphics card driver:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a.</span><span> </span><span>Press Windows <strong>key + X</strong> key and click on
<b>Device manager</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b.</span><span> </span><span>Search for <strong>Display Adapters.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c.</span><span> </span><span>Right-click on the <b>graphics card</b> and click on
<b>Update driver software</b>.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope this information helps. Please reply back with the status so that we could help you better.</div>

            Hi Winston and thank you for your reply,
<div><br />
<div>1. I did not have this problem in the Consumer Preview (using Pro now) where I made similar changes to what I have now: Disabled UAC, SmartScreen, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Specs:</div>
<div>MB: ASRock Z77 Pro 3</div>
<div>CPU: Intel i5 3570k</div>
<div>GPU: Radeon HD 7850</div>
<div>RAM: 4x2GB 1600MHz</div>
<div>SSD: Samsung 830 128GB</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as I know none of the reasons a-e should be a problem.</div>
<div>I tried both Method 1 and 2, but the problem still persists. :-(</div>
<div><br />

<p>Okay gripe number 1 already. Do I really have to favourite a thread every time I post because My Forums doesn't work as it once did?</p>
<p>There isn't an option &nbsp;in Settings to do it automatically, and much like the Beta, even if you do add to faves,then you cannot tell if some one else has posted after you or not.</p>
<p>Redonkulous.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to do it. I quite like using favorites.</p>

<p>If you click Favorite this forum, then it will appear on the front of forums.xbox.com</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg194.imageshack.us%2fimg194%2f5661%2f33333ps.png" /></p>
<p>or, you add with the star icon next to the forums...</p>

<p>And it will also appear.</p>
<p>There are a few other tools - looks like email subscription, RSS feeds - not had the chance to look at those yet.</p>

<p>This method above is probably better to monitor a conversation you can't or don't want to get involved in - yours is added automatically (but I'd say slightly more fiddly). It seems there are dozen ways to accomplish almost the same thing on the new format.</p>

<h2>            Malware www.searchnu.com&#47;406 replaced my default home page</h2>
                    <p>Hi, There.&nbsp; I have Vista Home Premium installed on my laptop. Last night my default web page
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.yahoo.com</a> of Internet Explorer was replaced with
<a href="http://www.searchnu.com/406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.searchnu.com/406</a> without my consent, yet yahoo.com is still shown as default web page when I clicked on the internet option icon under control panel.&nbsp; I tried Kaspersky TDSSKiller.exe and it didn't
 detect it, The Kaspersky Pure installed in my laptop did not detect it either.&nbsp; This is annoying as it is&nbsp;unknown what this malware is trying to do in my laptop, can someone help?&nbsp; Much appreciated for sharing a way to kill it and/or your advice.
</p>
<p>So far this malmare has not done any damage yet, but I believe it'd be too late when I spot the damage.&nbsp; It cold be trying to steal my ID info, bank account or other bad idea - kindly help so that next time when someone else encountered the same situation
 I can extend your kindness to him/her.&nbsp; /WenLin_770 7-10-2012</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Scan for Malware in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Windows Vista</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the <strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>&nbsp;option using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>

<p>IT has been the second time that my friends and i have tried to do the easter egg leading up to the point where everyone has to go in afterlife and board the plane. We keep glitching when we try to board the plane, it kicks us out and and we are stuck on
 the rooftops. We cant do anything after that... come on im not going to attempt easter egg until it is fixed</p>

i'm not entirely sure in your case, but i searched "charmap" on my system after reinstalling my character map [see my earlier reply] and these are the results:</p>
<p>1) filename: charmap.chm , location: C:\WINDOWS\Help</p>
<p>2) filename: charmap.hlp , location: C:\WINDOWS\Help</p>
<p>3) filename: CHARMAP.EXE-294D64C0.pf , location: C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch</p>
<p>4) filename: charmap.exe , location: C:\WINDOWS\system32</p>
<p>5) filename: charmap.exe , location: C:\WINDOWS\system32\dllcache</p>

            <p>i just found the answer by remembering to go back to it in system32; it waas there but not pointing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;C:\MyDocuments\All Users\StartMenu\Programs\Accessories\SystemsTools\CharacMap.exe
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>U might have to add the filetype .dll and also pin it to the Start Menu, where it will read charmap.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File name is %SystemRoot%\System32\charmap.exe</p>

<p>So, the problem is that Microsoft screwed up the permissions for those RegKeys, eh?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support and ask about known issues in their forums.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

CD/DVD drive does not appear in Windows Vista, or you receive this error during Windows<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />
<br />
Forums - a lot of real expert help<br />

<a href="http://www.myce.com/storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.myce.com/storage/</span></a></p>
<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            Chrome&#58; &#34;Connection not private&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>This morning when I clicked onto &nbsp;a site I use daily, using yahoo, I got a message saying 'your connection is not private'. The https was crossed out with a red line. I tried some other sites at random eg Marks and Spencer and got the same warning. I tried
 starting from &nbsp;google instead but with got the same result. When I clicked on the chrome sign at the bottom of the screen it took me straight to this site, thankfully. Is there anything I can do? The site I wanted is for a course I'm on and I've never had
 any trouble with it before.</p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I was looking for a particular writing magazine and I'm taking a course via it so it was very important to me to be able to open it. When I checked it on my phone it said that the certificate had expired and someone was trying to intercept
 its renewal - something like that anyway. So long-story-short, I updated my version of chrome, tried again and got the site without any warning coming up. I'm hoping I did the right thing</p>

<p>Thanks, I will be able to now. When I was able to get to the website they said that the problem had been at their end and causing them a headache all morning. Causing THEM a headache! It had me tearing my hair out. But all's well that ends well as the saying
 goes. I think the Microsoft community is great, even if the answer turned out to be so simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I receive an error code 0x8024402C while updating apps.</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 8.1. The first issue I have encountered is not being able to update the Apps included in the install, from the app store (which is also an app?). I get the following error code: "0x8024402C", I am not using a proxy, so I am
 at a loss as to the cause of the issue. Suggestions would be appreciated. Not sure if it matters, but I will mention&nbsp;it anyway,&nbsp;I have installed Kaspersky Antivirus 2014, though I cannot see where it has blocked anything.

    <title>Windows 10 Suddenly Inactive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerdietz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Suddenly Inactive</h2>
                    <p><span>I bought my PC new from Best Buy about 5 years ago and it came with Windows 8 pre-installed. I upgraded to Windows 10 back in
 2015 and everything has been going fine until today. I installed a new motherboard, CPU and RAM just yesterday, and updated Windows as well, but now today Windows says that it is not activated. I do not have my product key because the software came pre-installed
 and I bought my PC so long ago. How can I activate Windows now?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Btw I am signed into my computer using my Microsoft Account username and password, as I have been for the past 5 years. I had
 assumed that the product key was linked to that account, but I cannot find it anywhere. When I log onto my Microsoft Account online I see my computer listed under My Devices, but under info it lists my old CPU as the current processor. Maybe Windows is identifying
 my upgraded PC as an entirely new computer since the hardware is so different?</span></p>
<p>However it does recognize that I updated my PC just yesterday after I installed the new hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            Hey Tyler.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you upgraded the PC was assigned a permanent Digital License to reinstall Windows 10 as often as you want.  There is no Product key - you just skip the key during install and it will activate after connecting to the internet to check the Digital License on Microsoft servers. 
<br />
<br />BUT.... if Windows came pre-installed on the PC then changing the motherboard voids the license.  Free Upgrade inherits that restriction.  You'll need to buy a new license:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />If it was retail Windows then follow these steps for reactivating:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any retail Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key that's no longer needed you can use it to activate fresh, because that method is still in prolonged grace period which we have not yet heard has ended.  
<br />
<br />You can also ask for help from MS Support to get it activated:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

            Hello, 
<br />General guide for Activation error in Windows:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/...</a>

<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

<p>You cant, but what you can do is to clone the failing drive on to anew one.</p>

            If you have the keycode, the backup of the original vista for re-install is probably built-in to the computer.&nbsp; Call the computer manufacturer or check the owner manual for your model computer to see how to activate the built-in recovery.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;Packard Bell's's website &gt; look for your Computer's specifications &gt; find out brand of Hard Drive &gt; go to Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; find and download Hard Drive Diagnostic software and make a Bootable disk from it on the Computer you are
 using to get here, following their instructions &gt; test your Hard Drive to see if it has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can also use this Method to test your Hard Drive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Hard Drive is failing there is no use doing a System Recovery, as&nbsp;it will soon&nbsp;totally fail.</p>
<p>Either follow XP ROCK's advice if&nbsp;it is not too badly damaged as you would be transferring your problems to the new Hard Drive, or contact Packard Bell and see if they have Recovery disks available for sale</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Hard Drive is OK follow these steps at Boot to reinstall:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Packard Bell</strong></span><span>: P</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span><span><span>ress and hold the ALT key while
 pressing repeatedly the F10 key. Release the keys when a message displays that Windows is loading files.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span><span><span>Or contact Acer, as they own Packard Bell, and ask them how to make Recovery disks from the Recovery partition, IF the Hard Drive is OK.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span><span><span>__________________________</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span><span><span>Or buy and install a new Hard Drive and follow these steps:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>

<p>Microsoft removed all the Windows Vista downloads last week. Now there is no IE10/11, Office 2013 support for Windows Vista&nbsp;and no source of downloadable installation media. Windows Vista is meant to be at end of life in 2 years but its userbase is dwindling
 and it looks like you are being force to upgrade to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a free upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 but&nbsp;not from Windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install the Windows 10 Technical Preview and then take any advantage of any promotional deals Microsoft has wen its finally released:</p>

<h2>            XBox 360 SmartGlass app wont sign me in</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>I just recently downloaded and installed XBox 360 SmartGlass app on my laptop (Win 10 bld. 1809) and it will not find console properly setup and after failure I notice in the apps setting I am not signed into my Microsoft account? I assume it is using my
 Windows 10 login but it sure would be nice to verify what login name and password it is using!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many posts over the past few years with no resolution to the issue and MS support seems to "lock" down the post preventing a PILE-ON of complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thought MS?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums with this question. Sadly, the answer to your question may be that the Xbox 360 SmartGlass app has been officially retired and the app and its content are no longer being offered. However, what we recommend you
 use instead is our Xbox App for your Windows 10 device. You can sign into your Microsoft account there.</p>

<h2>            winload.exe corrupt or missing &#40;0xc0000221&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Have been running Vista on a Lenovo T61 Think Pad for over a year and just today (just a week after the warranty expired), windows vista will not boot up completely.&nbsp; I get the black screen with the following error:<br />
<br />
Windows Failed to start. a recenent hardware or software change may be the cause. to fix this problem:
<br />
(boot from the cd and repair windows) (doesnt actually say that but thats what it tells you to do)<br />
File: /windows/system32/winload.exe<br />
Status: 0xc0000221<br />
Info: the file is possibaly corupt. its header checksum does not match the computed checksum.<br />
<br />
I created a boot disk (since the manufacturer didn't provide one with the laptop) and was able to run the repair (with no luck) and the system restore (also with no luck).&nbsp; I can get to the c: prompt through the boot disk and I've run the HDD diagnostic from
 the BIOS screen and it passed (so far... still in process).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The manufacturer's help desk told me that I needed to delete or replace my entire hard drive and reinstall Windows which I just can't believe would be the solution to this...<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>
<span><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One option you can try is using the system file checker tool.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From the command prompt </span><span>type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect&nbsp;versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the system begins to POST are you able to hit F8 a few times and try to access the Recovery Screen?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so are you able to use LAST KNOWN good configuration to see if you are able to get backup and running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, can you boot into Safemode from that F8 screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If those options aren't available, the best step would be to get your Windows Vista Recovery CD and boot to it and run the STARTUP REPAIR options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 slow internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zanejohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 slow internet</h2>
                    <p>I have very slow internet connectivity with only Windows 10. I have 30 mb service but can only get about 15 mb with my Windows 10 computer (wired connection) while my other computers will connect at the full 30 mb level. I doubt it is the ISP since all my
 other devices do not have the problems.&nbsp; After turning off the app from the store and disabling the per to per updates it actually dropped from 20 mb to 15.</p>
<p>It shows while browsing and watching streaming media with browsing very choppy and streaming media having buffering issues. Windows is up to date according to Windows update and all the drivers are up to date. Windows 10 cured the problems I had with Windows
 8.1 that made it unusable but gave other problems. I find that I am using my Linux computer more because of the issues that I had with Windows 8.1 and having with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Am using my Windows 7 to do it because of the long lag between the typing and the computer screen showing it (unable to type comments). Also Windows 10 after booting takes 20+ minutes before it is usable with CPU sitting at 95-100% and disk access at 100%
 which is unacceptable. Every suggestion has either had no effect or made it worse.</p>

            <p>Hello Zane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding with any further troubleshooting, refer to the below link and check if the computer meets with the minimum requirements.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Specification</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please follow the below methods and check for the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</li></ul>
<span><span>1.&nbsp; </span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp; </span>To disable any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try Autorun and disable any start-up programs you don't need.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter. and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;troubleshooting in the search bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>

            actually after the trouble shooting is is showing only 6mg bandwidth now. Right now the lag on typing is not as bad as it was but it has been running long enough that it is down to 50 - 60 % CPU usage but the lag in loading web pages is as bad as ever
 and the scrolling still remains very choppy making it very hard to use the internet. Because of the long lag between clicking on an icon and the time before it responds (sometimes up to 15 min) it is hard to use and am finding that I am using my old Vista
 computer (which this computer was to replace) or my Linux computer have becoming very upset with Windows and will probably replace my Vista computer with Linux or Mac. I updated from 8.1 because it would not allow me to to open files in non-Microsoft programs
 (Widows photo viewer is not equivalent to the Gimp) and 14 hours for monthly updates to one that is so slow to respond.<br />

            After all the problems with ALL my Windows computers during December I finally found the cure for my Windows 10 problems, I deleted it and installed Linux. Problem solved. I did it the day after it locked up for 0ver 5 hours while it installed the Windows
 10 upgrade to build 10586. It nows runs much faster with much better web browsing. For over a week my Vista and Windows 7 computers were running svchost and windows update at over 50% utilization for over 6 hours with no updates found. The Windows 7 was a
 refurbished that was just set up. Reported it could not find any updates but it did install all the updates to tell me I need to upgrade to Windows 10 but NO security updates. I am finding that Linux can run everything that I need and works were Windows was
 not on my laptop.<br />

            I did buy a new Windows computer because people were trying to tell me it as just a hardware problem but am having so many problems with it that it has to be problems with windows. The new computer has a Pentium J2900 quad core processor running at 2.41
 GHz and it is also so slow it is pitiful. I am working on my family genealogy and use Libra Office, The Gimp, Inkscape and Scribus to do my work.Since Windows 8, all versions of Windows have balked at using Non-Microsoft software to open files and the Window
 10 was so bad that if I used the open file menu of the program it would use a Microsoft program to open the file. Windows update would take up to 14 hours to configure the computer and&nbsp; Windows 10 actually auto-updated while I was working on my file with CPU
 usage at 100% and the computer almost non-responsive. I solved the problem, I removed Windows and replaced it with Linux and the computer now runs faster and I can actually work on my genealogy.&nbsp; The sad part a my old Pentium core duo consistently runs circles
 around the Windows 8.1 and 10 computers and the laptop (1.3 GHz) can match the new desktop in speed once I installed Linux on it. I hate leaving Windows because my primary genealogy program is Windows only (backing up all my files to gedcom so other genealogy
 programs can use it).<br />
