<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e46d0e86-162f-4ae4-80f2-df8ea6c74967" title="BM7803">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you register a mobile number or a Skype Number as your sender ID?</p>
<p>SMS sender/caller ID only supports mobile number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, SMS text messages sent to mobile phones in <strong>Canada</strong>, <strong>
China</strong>, <strong>Taiwan </strong>and the <strong>USA </strong>will not display your Skype Name or a validated mobile number. Instead, these SMS text messages will have
<strong>generic, pre-defined numbers </strong>as the sender ID. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For SMS text messages sent to mobile phones in <strong>Russia</strong>, the Skype Name is not displayed. A generic number is displayed unless youâ€™ve set your mobile number as the sender ID.</p>

<p>Hi BM7803,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your SMS messages do not reflect the validated number or Skype Name, it can mean that local telephone company is blocking Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest for you to get in touch with your local telco to check if they are blocking Skype numbers.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been trying a lot of fixes for the bsod error I have been getting after installing a fresh copy of windows 10 on my custom laptop but I keep getting different error messages and BlueScreenViewer isn't really any help.</p>

<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I used driver booster to update all the drivers at once since I couldn't do it manually since it crashed to often to get this done. So these should be up to date. In previous attempts to get this laptop working (this is the 5th

<p>Hi XP ROCKS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer. I reverted my laptop back as far as I could and installed the drivers that were provided by the manufacturer of my laptop. Still getting blue screens. I installed the last version of rapid storage technology, which was newer than the
 one provided but it didn't help so I reverted to the one provided by the laptop manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the new minidumps of the last couple of blue screens and the new msinfo32.</p>

            <p>Milan, after taking a look at your msinfo32. file, it seem the issue began right after a failed installation of the intel wireless driver, Netwtw04.sys</p>

            <p>Thanks again for the fast response,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that because of the constant crashes I had to install some driver in safe mode, don't know if that is relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I indeed did not update the realtek audio driver because I installed the creative sound blaster audio driver and thought it might interfer with eachother. I managed to install the provided realtek sound driver the manufacturer provided in normal mode since
 even after I installed it in safe mode it would prompt the installation again after normal boot (this driver was different from the one you provided).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first repaired the wlan driver but it still crashed, then just uninstalled it, that also didn't work. Then succesfully reinstalled latest version again in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I also installed the realtek audio driver you mentioned in normal mode but don't know if it has overwriten the other one or not because they seemed to be pertaining to different things (although both audio)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this morning my laptop also sometimes just freezes up, which I thought would be a graphics issue but those should be up-to-date. I also tried booting with low-graphics to see if this would fix it, but nope still crashed. I just tried to updated both
 graphics drivers in normal boot mode (intel 530 and geforce nvidia) via the device manager, hoping the windows catalog only contains the verified drivers. The geforce was succesfull in updating in normal mode but I got crashes during the updating of the intel
 530. The fact that it found an update is strange because I manually upgraded the intel driver already via the intel site. So uninstalled the intel driver and reinstalled the latest version from their website in safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can maybe also see in the previous nfo, I installed samsung magician to check for firmware on the SSD's but these were all good, this program does keep asking for permission to change things on the drive on every startup though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw that it mentioned the synaptic driver in one of the crashes but I already had this problem earlier today and installed the provided driver but now updated this manually to the newest one from the synaptics website (which I think was just the same version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of this I am still getting crashes constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>new nfo and dump-files:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvqjRfa9FLB5jXfYWz3rQpZPJ3L9</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS my windows doesn't have the jubulee update yet but since I am getting this much crashes it will never get through it and I am afraid that if it crashes during it might mess up everything. I have no errors in safe mode so I am pretty sure it is still driver
 related.</p>

<h2>            UNRELIABLE RESUME FROM SUSPEND In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>UNRELIABLE RESUME FROM SUSPEND</p>
<p>This problem has existed on and off ever since I installed Windows 8 on this PC. Initially there were no problems, then this problem started for no apparent reason. The problem has always been intermittent: present for a few weeks, then absent for a few
 weeks before returning. Upgrading to Windows 8.1 had no effect upon the problem. The only way I have found to get a short respite from the problem is to close all applications, select RESTART, then, at the boot-up screen where I choose which operating system
 I want to boot to, select the other options at the bottom of the screen, then the other options again on the next screen, and then click on TURN OFF PC. Then restart the PC normally. That usually gives me a day or two without problems, but, like I said at
 the beginning, sometimes this problem goes away for weeks at a time before returning, and when it does return, it is bothersome for a few weeks, then goes away again all by itself.</p>
<p>I've searched the internet for possible explanations and solutions several times, and tried all sorts of suggested fixes, but nothing has worked. Some seemed to work (eg,upgrading video driver), but a week or two later the problem always returned, thus proving
 the "fix" was only coincidence.</p>
<p>The PC is left running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>When the PC is behaving itself, when I come to the PC, the power LED is flashing, and a left click on the mouse resumes the PC into normal activity.</p>
<p>When the PC is playing up, when I come to the PC, one of two possibilities happen: (1) the power is flashing, but a left click on the mouse does nothing, but a tap on the power button on the PC resumes the PC into activity. At other times, when I come to
 the PC, (2) the power LED is ****, there is no hard drive LED indication of hard drive activity, and left click on the mouse does nothing, and tapping the power button on the PC does nothing. I have to hold the power button down long enough to turn the
 PC off, then press it again to turn the PC on again. The PC then boots, runs the BIOS diagnostics, boots to the choose-operating-system screen, then boots the default operating system: WIndows 8.1. Once I log in, I find all applications loaded and running
 just as I left them when I last used the PC. (Thank goodness!)</p>
<p>Yesterday I made a breakthrough in the diagnosis - but I don't know what to make of what I observed. Yesterday afternoon I got sick of the problems and closed all applications and went through the various steps to turn the PC off via the restart sequence
 (as I described above), then did a bit of work on the PC for a while, then left it alone for a few hours. That evening, I was just sitting in the same room as the PC for a couple of hours, reading, and during that time I noticed the PC go to sleep (as it is
 configured to do) after the time it is configured to wait before doing so, just as it should do, BUT as soon as the power supply shut off and the power LED started flashing to indicate sleep mode,
<u>the PC immediately reawakened itself</u>! It restarted and displayed the picture that displays until you click the mouse to logon, then, after the configured idle time, it again went to sleep, just as it should, BUT AGAIN it immediately restarted itself
 as soon as it went to sleep! This happened several times while I was in the room with it, reading, but after doing that several times, it changed it's behaviour, and went to sleep ok, with power supply off and power LED flashing, but when it automatically
 restarted itself a moment later, it did so incorrectly and the power LED came hard on, the power supply came on, but no hard drive LED activated and neither clicking the mouse nor tapping the on-off button would do anything. I had to hold the power button
 down to turn the PC off, then tap it again to turn the PC on. And, as usual when the PC is playing up, when I eventually managed to get it up and running, all my applications were up and running just as I had left them.</p>
<p>The pattern I observed last night of resuming correctly a number of times, then failing to resume correctly, is one I have suspected for quite some time. But until I actually observed it last night, I wasn't quite sure. It would seem that I can clear the
 cause by shutting down all applications and going through the various restart steps until I get to the option to TURN OFF THE PC, but the cause of the problem is cumulative, and each time the PC resumes correctly after that, a little more problem is accumulated,
 until the problem crosses threshold and the PC no longer resumes correctly. To me, that sounds like software corrupting or not releasing memory correctly. But how do I find out what is the culprit? And how come I go for weeks with the problem occurring, then
 weeks without a problem, in a never-ending pattern? I haven't noticed any software (or hardware) that I use when the problem is present that I'm not using when the problem is absent.</p>
<p>I don't want to do any more trial-and-error "diagnosis" on this problem. For months now, I've suspected various items of hardware and software, and proven them all innocent by having the problem return when that particular suspect couldn't possibly be the
 cause. I want to tackle this problem properly, by recording and reading activity logs, checking configuration files, and the like. But I don't know how to do those things in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me get to the bottom of this please? It is REALLY annoying!</p>

<p>Hi Anannya. Thanks for pointing me at the Application and System logs. That gave me some tools to work with, to find out what was happening when I wasn't present at the PC. They confirmed the pattern of self-resume each time the PC went to sleep, but didn't
 identify the culprit.</p>
<p>However yesterday something happened that does seem to have identified the culprit. I had to restart the PC after receiving the latest Windows updates, and the BIOS pre-boot diagnostics halted with a CPU over-temperature error. I immediately turned off the
 PC and opened the case, and found everything way to hot, especially the power supply. So I reversed one of the chassis fans, so that the number of fans pumping air in matched the number pumping out, which cooled the PC down considerably - and appears to have
 had the side-effect of solving the auto-resume-upon-sleep problem! It would seem that something, somewhere, was running so hot that it was causing the PC to restart each time the PC was told to go to sleep!</p>
<p>Anyway, that's current conclusions. I've been caught with this problem before, thinking I've solved it only to have it come back again a few days or weeks later, so I won't get too confident that it's solved 100% yet. If the cause really was the PC overheating,
 it certainly explains why none of my changes to either hardware or software ever produced a permanent fix.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            Since this happen in two different ISP, try reset your modem or router and also contact your ISP support. Some ISPs will set some rule and limitation for their user , but in your case discuss it with your ISP or contact your PC manufacturer's support.

            You won't be able to use the full 4GB. 32 bit can only see a max of 4GB - usually around 3.5GB, but if your graphics card is using shared memory it will be even less. ï»¿Check to see how you can reduce your graphics card shared memory and increase available
 RAM, usually it's done in the BIOS, or in your GPU settings.<br />
<br />

The usable memory may be less than the installed memory on Windows 7-based computers:<br />

            Thank you for the reply, it's appreciated. However, the graphics card is not the problem. I can put in one 1GB stick and it shows that as the usable memory. Same holds true for a 2GB stick. A 2 GB + a 1 GB shows as 3 GB installed but only 2GB usable. More
 installed memory shows up as detected but still only 2GB usable. Here's the point - With a single 1GB stick in 1GB shows as usable. With a 2GB stick in 2GB shows as usable. With a 2GB and a 1GB stick in only 2GB are usable. No matter how much mem is installed,
 the usable is always just 2GB.

<p><strong>Whenever i play a game for about 1 hour or sometimes lesser, my laptop will hang. My screen will turn black and the whole system is hanged. The only thing i can do is by conducting a force restart. The games i played are Left 4 Dead 2, Modern Warfare2,
 &nbsp;GTA IV etc. I read from other forums that cleaning registry or reinstall the game would help. But What i ever i tried even change system boot services at msconfig and off debug at cmd, but none works. Can anyone help me? It's very annoying, i couldn't play
 any game.</strong></p>

<p>It should not be "related to OS [sic]" if you bought the laptop with Windows 7 preinstalled. All the correct drivers would have been preinstalled, too. My son plays very graphics-intensive games on his Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit machine with absolutely no
 issues, so it is not "related to OS". It is related to the hardware's capabilities and the drivers.</p>
<p>So if your video card meets the games' hardware specs then you should be able to play without overheating. Make sure you don't have a lot of other programs/processes running in the background so as not to take up any unnecessary processing power whilst gaming.
 Go to HP's website and download all updated drivers and utilities, including video and power management software. If you have already done all that then .... there is nothing to be confused about - your computer is overheating, this is a hardware problem,
 get it fixed or replaced.</p>

            <p>The following steps is the process that I use to correct this issue for my employees at work.&nbsp;It involves modifying the registry and should be approached very carefully as modifying the registry incorrectly can potentially damage your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said the fix that I use for this issue is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your search box type "regedit.exe" and hit enter, which will pull up the windows registry editor</li><li>In the view you will expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and continue working your way to the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\gpsvc. The following screenshot is a partial output of what you will see, but the gpsvc key is too far down to
 get in the screenshot, but it will be on the same level as the .NET CLR keys you see.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad569d53-b7c4-44b0-80b8-6341923a2b21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad569d53-b7c4-44b0-80b8-6341923a2b21" /></a></li><li>Once you have found the gpsvc key left click on it and you'll see some values in the right window like in the following screenshot. Most likely you will see the value of "Start" is 4 which is what typically will cause the issue. Double click where it says
 "Start"</li></ul>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8a0eafd-ecd4-4e25-ac28-d0c64a1b2fd7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8a0eafd-ecd4-4e25-ac28-d0c64a1b2fd7" /></a></div>
<ul>
<li>Once you double click start you'll get a pop-up window like this<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7fc3a0a-bfb5-40fe-8981-507938ed6459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7fc3a0a-bfb5-40fe-8981-507938ed6459" /></a></li><li>Again, the value you will probably see is "4". Change the value to "2" and hit okay, and then restart your computer.</li></ul>

            <p>thanks for your help Todd_S_88 well I did answer a wee bit earlier saying couldnt find the last bit but I am a bit of a persistant person so I tried again and realised what I had done wrong and eventually found the last box you have shown on your print screene
 alas mine also says 2 any other ideas would be greatfully recieved. I have gone into the event log if that helps and this is what it says :_ The Microsoft Account Sign-in Assistant service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion. Sorry that they are pics all the time but dont know how to do a print screeene

            <p>Unfortunately the registry fix was my main go-to fix. I did a search on the event in your picture and found a reddit thread of someone having a similar issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/windows8/comments/3fwtne/how_do_i_fix_service_control_manager_event_7000/</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the commenters said they had success by running a command prompt as administrator and doing the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02284bed-950c-4f73-92ea-320cbaa04946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02284bed-950c-4f73-92ea-320cbaa04946" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pretty safe command that you can try out to see if it helps with the issue</p>

            <p>No worries and I appreciate you hanging in there and being patient! What you'll want to do is open the start menu and in the search box type "cmd". It should pop up in the top as a program, and from there you'll want to make sure you right click on it and
 select "Run as administrator"</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/957bcd51-ba39-41f8-8564-a5afa4a40f85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/957bcd51-ba39-41f8-8564-a5afa4a40f85" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you'll run the "netsh winsock reset" command. If that doesn't help unfortunately I'm at a bit of a loss. The process you're referring to is called a "System Restore", which is the term you'd also search for in windows to pull up the utility. Knock on
 wood I've never personally had to perform a system restore so I can't say how much it will impact your current files and settings, but if this issue is causing you enough problems and you were interested on it you can do some searches on "Windows System Restore"
 to get some more info. The general MS post on that process is https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore</p>

            Definitely happy to help! I'm wondering if some other program is running when you do cmd through the search. What I'd try is go to Start-&gt;Computer to open a File Explorer, and then go to C: -&gt; Windows -&gt; System32 which is the folder that command prompt
 is stored in, so you can try finding the cmd.exe program directly in there. If it still just gives a black box that you can't type in or anything I'd try hitting enter a few times to see if it gives you a prompt; otherwise I'd need a picture to see if I can
 figure out what's happening there.

    <title>Issues running ICACLS from a Win7 machine to affect permissions on a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam_athanassov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues running ICACLS from a Win7 machine to affect permissions on a Server 2008</h2>
                    <p>I am working on redesigning the folder structure for one of our file servers. I have created a batch file that users will run and it will automatically create a "Personal" folder for them&nbsp;on the server based on their username..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp; want the script to&nbsp;also break the inheritance for these folders and set up the Adminstrators with full permissions, the Scanners group with modify permissions, and the individual user with Modify permissions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added this ICACLS command in my script (batchfile):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>icacls %server%\%directorate%\Individual_Folders\%username% /inheritance:r /grant:r "Administrators":(OI)(CI)F /grant:r "Scanners":(OI)(CI)M /grant:r "domain\%username%":(OI)(CI)M
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>server = \\serverName</p>
<p>directorate = directorateFolder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I run the script from the server itself&nbsp;(Server 2008),&nbsp;it works perfectly. The issue I'm having is when I run it from another system (Win 7) this command hangs up. Is there something I need to add or am I missing something? Is Win 7 handling things differently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My account is in the Administrators group on the server so it shouldn't be a permissions issue. I'm running the script with my account both on the server and the Win 7 system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my first experience with icacls and I'm not sure if I'm overlooking something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

    <title>Installing XP Mode &#47; Windows Virtual PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing XP Mode &#47; Windows Virtual PC</h2>
                    
<p>I have yet to successfully install XP Mode or Windows Virtual PC on my Win7 Ultimate 32-bit system.&nbsp; Some background...&nbsp; It's an older system - P4C 3.2GHz (800) w/ 2GB RAM.&nbsp; I have older apps that wouldn't run on Win7, so I have MS Virtual PC 2007 installed
 running a Win2000Pro VM to run these apps on.</p>
<p>I install the XP Mode download (the VHD) w/o a problem.&nbsp; I install the Win Virtual PC download, and am prompted to reboot, which I do.&nbsp; As per the MS instructions, I then attempt to install the XP Mode update for systems w/o hardware virtualization (which
 I don't have), and it fails with an error saying it's "not applicable to my system".&nbsp; Finally, save for my VPC 2007 shortcut off the Start Menu, there is no Windows VPC shortcut to start XP Mode with.</p>
<p>Why isn't Windows VPC appearing/installing?&nbsp; Do I need to uninstall VPC 2007 first?&nbsp; If I lose Win VPC, can I still run my Win2000 VM in Win VPC?&nbsp; (I would need to.)&nbsp; Can the two VPCs exist simultaneously on the same system?&nbsp; Why isn't the XP Mode update
 applicable to my system?</p>
<p>Although the installation instructions seem pretty simple and straightforward, the install is not happening as easily as suggested...</p>
<p>Thanks much for any help!</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot start after revert.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed the new operating system, Windows 10. After installing it, I was not pleased with how it affected my computer and decided I wanted to revert back to Windows 7, as I saw that Microsoft gave the option to do so. After reverting to
 what I had assumed would be my OS before I updated, I was told that Windows failed to start. I chose to use the startup repair tool to try and fix what was wrong, and was prompted with this error.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to disable the new volume overlay&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm not a fan of the new addition to the volume overlay whenever I change the volume. Is there a way to disable the new portion while keeping the normal volume bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>To be specific, the bar that displays the volume, 16 in the photo, is what I want to keep, while the larger window displaying "chrome.exe" is what I'm hoping to remove.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi LukeTorian 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is a new feature introduced by Chrome which can be disabled easily, if you don't like it.
<br />
<br />Copy the below line and paste into address bar of Chrome
<br />chrome://flags
<br />In Search box at top, type Hardware and Enter
<br />Set Hardware Media Key Handling to Disabled
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Luke,
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That should remove that for you . . .

    <title>Converting WTV files... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bushmaster78fs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting WTV files...</h2>
                    Folks, Win7 records TV shows in this WTV format and has a built-in tool to convert them to dvr-ms format. I use PS3 Media Server and it doesn't recognize WTV yet so I have to convert. The problem is, WTV Converter that comes with Win7 starts the conversion
 process and then dies off after converting like 5-6 minutes of the show. How can I diagnose this problem? Would a codec pack cause this? Better yet, is there an alternative converter for WTV into whatever?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...

            I use Roxio..Easy Media Creator 10(suite)..from 2007..there's a newer version called Roxio 2010/<br />
Go online and look at that product for your file type--conversion requirements..<br />
I also use a external capture card..called the::PYRO A/V Link..Part# API-558-EFS..<br />
I usually..use this for my VCR.tapes/and convert to AVI via a Firewire cable..analog-IN/firewire-OUT/<br />
Or..its the connection for my Camcorder..Firewire-IN/Firewire-OUT/<br />
===<br />
What does your PS3 use for output connections..??<br />
The PYRO A/V Link allows you to use RCA connector's..R&amp;L(audio)..plus that Yellow(vid)connector..<br />
It will accept a S-video Input..<br />
..and a Firewire-input..<br />
===<br />
Next..its Roxio CAPTURE TOOL..and a choice of MPEG-2 or AVI..calling the Ext. Capture Card..a AVI-compliant-device..&lt;&lt;--same a camcorder/<br />
===<br />
I think this would answer many questions about a Uplink-in video..the capture card costs about 130-dollars..<br />
===<br />
I might add..a camcorder creates a DV File..and is fully compatible with the AVI File..<br />
The VCR-tape..however is not a great file..you get a VCR(VHS) quality project..<br />
You need to understand the video files..frame size,,640 x 480..720 x 480..or you may get poor results..<br />
I use a camcorder so its never a issue..considering a VHS(vcr)Tape..well its just not a great project..<br />
Look up the SPECS..on that&nbsp;PS3 File..before making a purchase.

            <p>Andres solution is incomplete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will let you download the .iso but not use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to install you must use a generic product key. Once installed you must change product key to your Windows 8.0 product key which will activate Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full solution is detailed here:</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Please help:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting the S10-3T setup the way I like it, I tried to delete some rather large disk images from the recycle bin, along with some other files - about 12 gigs in total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I emptied the recycle bin, I got a window saying that a file was too large for this disk's file architecture (or words to that effect). &nbsp;I pressed OK, and I didn't get the usual "deleting items" window. &nbsp;Instead, nothing
 happened. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files are gone from the recycle bin, but my disk info did not show any increase in free space. &nbsp;So the files are stll around somewhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't want to "restore" the files - I just want to delete them permanently. &nbsp;How can I track them down? &nbsp;I did try Disk Cleaner but that didn't track the files. &nbsp;Don't tell me I have to buy a third party software to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help to this mystery in helping me reclaim the 12 gigs or so of space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ken</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to scan the computer for error.</p>
<p>Follow this step to do the same:</p>
<p>1. Click Start<br />
2. Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD-&gt;Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
3. At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>Additionally you may refer the following link for more information:</p>

<p>Me too! &nbsp;February 3rd the Classic game wouldn't load. &nbsp;February 4th it's the Lightning Tiles. &nbsp;I click on them, the loading screen comes up for a second, then I'm back to the Windows 8.1 start screen. &nbsp;I've tried it numerous times, and restarted my desktop

<p>Same problem, tested on different hardware with the same result.</p>
<p><strong>What version &amp; build of Windows are you running?</strong></p>
<p>a) Windows RT 8.1 Version 6.3 Build 9600 (Surface RT)</p>
<p>b) Windows 8.1 Enterprise Version 6.3 Build 9600 (x64, Custom desktop)</p>
<p><strong>What is the make (who made it) &amp; model (if you know it) of the device or devices you are using?</strong></p>
<p>a) Microsoft Surface RT</p>
<p>b) Custom built desktop (Core i7 860, 8GB Ram, 2*Radeon HD 6950 (CrossFire)) (ASUS GFx and MB)</p>
<p><strong>About how long ago did you start having this problem?</strong></p>
<p>Started yesterday - Feb 3 and again today Feb 4</p>
<p><strong>Have you noticed this problem happening on any other games?</strong></p>
<p>No!</p>
<p><strong>Describe your problem. Please explain what happens from the time you launch the game until the problem happens.</strong></p>
<p>One game yesterday and one game today was affected. The load screen apperas (circling dots in RT, spinning domino in enterprise) and stays on for a long time before the game crashes, i.e. drops out to the start menu. The game is still in memory so I can
 switch back to it using Alt+Tab. This reloads the game. It is always the same game instance that fails and the order in which they are played is not important.</p>

<h2>            Error 80040154 when activating windows 8.1 pro and office 2013 via KMS</h2>
                    I used win 8.1 pro and office 2013 for several years with the permission of my university. However, last weekend, when I start my computer outside my university, the system and the office both became to inactivate. I try to re-activate them again when
 I got back to school, however, an error occurred: "0x80040154, Class not registered (SWbemObjectEx )". I tried to use 'slmgr.vbs' command to set the KMS service and activate my windows manually, but in vain. Is it any solutions? Thanks.

<h2>            CPU under utilized even when system running slow.</h2>
                    <div>I have a Dell Precision M4300 notebook with Intel Core2 Duo T8300 (2.40GHz) CPU. Recently I upgraded to Windows 8 pro from Vista Business. I use a lot of graphics intensive applications and I noticed a drop in performance. The baffling part is that CPU

<div>The CPU shows a 25% maximum utilization with speed step on and 37% with speed step off. While with the previous windows installation, it showed 100% utilization while these programs ran. Even the system performance rating has dropped from 4.4 to 3.1 (2.4

            <p>Hi ad,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to tell you that having a low CPU Usage is a <strong>good
</strong>thing i.e. preferably below 50%. Having a high CPU Usage shows that your computer is running several processes using up&nbsp;a lot of usage which corresponds to those processes being useless or malicious.</p>
<p>I suspect that you are confused between CPU Usage and performance.</p>
<p>An increased CPU Usage does not mean having a resourceful use of the Computer. Performance is rather high when the CPU Usage is low.</p>
<p>You really do not have to increase your CPU Usage which will slow it down to a huge extent. If you still want to do it, what?&nbsp;Run several useless processes unnecessarily! :P</p>
<p>If you want to increase your system performance, in the task manager search for Processes and disable those which are not needed or appear malicious.</p>
<p>If your PC is slow right from start up, you can speed it up by disabling start up programs and applications.</p>
<p>To do this,</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows+ R or search for Run on the start screen.</li><li>Type in 'msconfig.exe' without the quotes and press ok or enter.</li><li>In the start up tab, search for programs which are not needed by you and disable them(<strong>Caution!</strong>).</li><li>To disable applications, type in the following in the Run prompt without the quotes, replacing &lt;abc&gt; with&nbsp;your user profile folder name.<br />
%systemdrive%\Users\&lt;abc<em>&gt;</em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</li><li>Delete any unrequired shortcuts.</li></ol>

<div>You do not ever want to have 100% cpu usage. If you did, everything would be so slow that it would seem to be doing nothing. CPU utilization *should* be low. If your CPU utilization is running 25-37%, it's already on the high side, and that's likely why
 your machine is running slowly. For example, at the moment, I am running around 3-5%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just a guess as to what's making it run slowly, but malware infection is very common these days. Your first step in troubleshooting should be to make sure you are not infected.</div>

<div>Hi Ashwin,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That precisely is my problem, even if I run a lot of applications, the CPU utilization stops at a maximum of 37%, not 50%, not 38% but precisely at 37%. It seems like there is a lock active that does not allow the CPU to go beyond 0.91 GHz speed and 37%.
 This 37% turns into 25% and 0.60 GHz if I enable speed step through BIOS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I was using Vista, the CPU 'normally' ran at &lt;5% (which it still does), but when I used the graphic intensive software (3Ds Max+<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Ray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VRay</a>, AutoCAD, SketchUp+<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Ray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VRay</a>)
 the CPU would jump to 100% while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_rendering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
rendering</a> and would finish it in 15mins. Now, when I do the same, CPU remains at 37% and the task takes around 35mins to finish up. This is a major degradation. Though for normal usage like web surfing or music, the CPU runs normally at &lt;5%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since the maximum utilization percentage is a precise number, I figured there is something in the Win8 OS that limits it to that. If yes, how do I change it? Or is it that Win8 is not compatible with my processor?</div>

<div>Thanks Ken for your answer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My machine runs at 3-5% during normal usage like when I'm using MS Office or Explorer. There are no issues with the startup too. The problem comes when I use a program that require a high processing power. While
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_rendering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rendering</a> an image in <a href="http://www.autodesk.in/products/autodesk-3ds-max/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
3Ds Max</a> or <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sketchup</a>, you would normally expect the CPU to jump at 100% till the rendering is finished. This is how it worked with Vista.</div>
<div><br />
<div>While in Win8, the CPU stops at exactly 37%, the rendering takes more than double the time it should normally take. I have an updated BIOS and drivers too are updated. I hoped that there would be some tweak that could iron this out.</div>

            For me it just worked to unplug and plug again the power cord. Some Dell computers decrease the system performance when they detect an "unknown" adapter. This may happen after an upgrade. Normally, it should work with this.

<h2>            Surface Dock support Dell U2312HM</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new in the surface world and just discovered that the surface dock doesn't support every Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell U2312HM. Connecting it to the Surface Dock makes the screen look "scratched" (especially the black colours).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect the display to the Surface Pro 4 itself it works flawless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal or could this mean that my Dock is broken?</p>

            Dear Chr1ss111
<br />
<br />While the u2312hm is not on the compatible list, there are many unlisted monitors that work well with the Dock.
<br />
<br />Can you supply a photo of how the display looks when connected via the Dock?

<h2>            Error codes 0x7004FC12, 0x8007003 , 0x80073CF6, and igdkmd64.sys &#40;corrupted file&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Since I decided to upgrade from Win8.1 to Win10, I get those error codes.&nbsp;And trying to know what they mean and how to repair is hazardous and really time-consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here we go :</p>
<p>- 0x7004FC12&nbsp;appears when I try to activate my Office 365 or 2016. Activation cannot be completed for some reason.</p>
<p>- 0x8007003 appears when I try to repair Windows Mail &amp; Calendar, Windows Clock &amp; Alarms, Windows Calculator, and Windows Twitter.</p>
<p>- 0x80073CF6 apppears when I try to uninstall some of those Windows&nbsp;apps listed above. Actually that means the package cannot be registered...</p>
<p>- Win10 cannot automatically detect the proxy parameters of the network (here, Internet).</p>
<p>- 'Video Schedular Internal Error' or 'Video_TDR_Failure' (igdkmd64.sys): indeed, my applications sometimes cannot access the graphic hardware anymore (especially when changing resolution&nbsp;while switching apps by&nbsp;using alt-tab) and make the PC reboot and
 send you an auto-diagnosis. Apparently, it is the integrated vidcard (here, Intel) that is causing&nbsp;such problems (I run an ASUS ROG laptop&nbsp;equipped with Nvidia GTX880).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted your Office Online-Support service and they suggested me to repair my Win10, using an ISO file (AND without DVD or USB!). Unfortunately, the suggested link by&nbsp;the Community (
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench</a>&nbsp;, as per Anas El Basraoui) currently leads to a blank page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also noticed that my version of Win10 is 10.0.10240 and that my partitions may have gone wrong after Win8.1 upgraded to Win10.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only two&nbsp;LISTED partitions have nothing like "Recovery" or "EOM", and Win10&nbsp;could now have troubles with properly dealing with my Microsoft ID/Account on my PC&nbsp;and with Windows Update (even if&nbsp;it keeps telling me all is fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dev Network of Microsoft could not provide me a proper solution&nbsp;for error 0x80073CF6&nbsp;and tells me to ask&nbsp;the Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm mother-tongued French, but I want my&nbsp;request to be international and not only in French. I apologize for any approximation&nbsp;with my words and style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>
