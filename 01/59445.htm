<h2>            SFC could not repair all corrupt files, hashes do not match</h2>
                    I have had a problem with windows 10 for about 4 weeks now, it all started when I installed BlueStacks which lets you run android programs on windows. Every search I did to get info on bluestack said it's a great and safe program ! What I know it did,
 it partitioned my system drive with a virtual disk and even after doing a uninstall the partition stayed there, the volume name for the partition had about 24 characters so no drive utility would delete the partition. I had back ups of windows and a system
 repair disk which was worthless ! I found a drive utility that wiped the drive completely and then re-installed wndows 10. My computer ran well for 2 days and now the blue screen of death has returned, I connected with a trained Microsoft tech and he couldn't
 repair windows. I only now have some corrupt system files but I am unable to restore them sfc cant do it. I don't really expect advice to restore my computer, I'm just letting off some steam, my next desktop may very well be android

            Hi Robert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When SFC cannot repair System files after three separate attempts - and after DISM has been run on the image by which the files are checked and confirms it's integrity - then the next step is a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />
<br />I would also compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I suggest this is that no one of millions who have completed the install in the link above has ever come back to report another problem that I've seen.  You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I recommend an in-place upgrade repair.
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then follow the instruction here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1903.
<br />In a nutshell you just download the tool &amp; choose to upgrade now.

With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry

<h2>            IIS product support - the kind where we can open a ticket to the product team</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does one get to open a support ticket with MS for IIS support? I have a problem, I have done trawling the net for past two days to fix the problem, to no avail, and was thinking of logging a ticket.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem: I could not find where to start to log a ticket. How difficult can it be to start logging a ticket; paid or otherwise? With many products there is a link 'Contact us' which after 2-3 clicks allows you to log a ticket. Either I cannot find one,
 OR MS has hidden it so deep that it is truly difficult to find. Please help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The root problem: I just cannot seem to have IIS send gzip content to .Net Web APIs returning json data. And yes, I have done all kinds of things suggested on various forums - enabling dynamic compression at machine level, putting mime types in various config
 files from application config files to app config files etc etc. Have been doing this for past 2 days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I see that even the options to select Windows server is not there while posting this question on this site. I am hoping that someone can point me to 'go here to start'. I can &nbsp;go from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Amit</p>

            <p>TechNet itself is so confusing. The link that you gave me lands one on IIS page; crucially NO link for support on that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is forum on the ribbon; one goes to forums, and lo and behold, there is no entry for IIS. There are entries for windows server, Biz talk server etc. But not IIS. I understand that IIS may be considered as part of the windows server. So when one then
 proceeds and selects Windows server, one still DOES NOT get IIS as a forum choice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I end up posting my question in some generic forum like setup - https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/d2042738-b1e2-4ad9-a233-884d84efff86/open-a-support-ticket-with-ms-for-iis-support?forum=winserver8setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>May be this just reflects the market reality - poor support for a product that is clearly a laggard in the market; much behind likes of Apache.

            No I did not get an answer. I would like to have only icons on my favorites bar but cannot find&nbsp; a way to do this.&nbsp; Also there is no way to click and save a webpage to the favorites bar as before.

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 10 and ToonTown Rewritten Fails</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, ToonTown Rewritten no longer works. &nbsp;Whenever I attempt to launch, it immediately fails without bringing up the program. &nbsp;The error log indicates the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The application requested hardware acceleration, but your OpenGL driver, GDI Generic, only supports software rendering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need to install a hardware-accelerated OpenGL driver, or, if you actually "want" to use a software renderer,</strong></p>
<p><strong>then alter the hardware/software configuration in your Config.prc file.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to rollback to the previous display device driver using the 'Device Manager', but no previous version existed. &nbsp;Also, I have no idea where the Config.prc file is located, nor what to edit if I found it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I need the help for window 10, not 8 and older. </p>
<p>Toontown Rewritten says they support windows 10 if you have at least 4.0 GB ram, and I do, but I must be missing something?</p>
<p>It loads and logs in and then flashes the application but then crashes it.</p>
<p>It worked fine before windows 10</p>

            I tested the program in compatibility mode to no avail. &nbsp;I get the same results. &nbsp;However, I was advised by the game developers to uninstall the generic graphics driver provided by Microsoft Windows 10 (I assume using the Device Manager), then reinstall
 the Windows 7 graphics driver. &nbsp;I'm concerned though... If I uninstall the current graphics driver, doesn't that mean my display will go away, and if it does, how would I then be able to reinstall the Windows 7 driver?

            I tried to upgrade my Intel graphics driver at that point and found that I had the latest upgrade.&nbsp; I have since uninstalled Windows 10.&nbsp; I found no other solution.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this same problem and I found that this website solved the problem:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's slightly different, first find the directory of Toontown Rewritten in Program Files and right click on TTREngine. Make sure it's that and not the launcher, go on Properties and then click the Compatibility tab. Then select Windows 8 from the drop
 down menu under Compatibility Mode and select OK. This worked for me, hope it helps. :)</p>

            <p>I had this issue since upgrading to Windows 10, tried various compatibility options, tried updating graphics card drivers. The game worked fine previously in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I tried adding an exception in my antivirus software (I'm using AVG) and now the game launches.</p>

<p>Hi. How could I could be related to:</p>
<p>1) that I can't also login into Xbox app on iOS, Windows 10 and Android regardless of the IP address until its Ukrainian&nbsp;IP address? I tried different&nbsp;IP addresses.</p>
<p>2) Why are all of the users in Ukraine affected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my guess it is not anyone's&nbsp;<span>personal IP, it is bad engineering&nbsp;on Microsoft part.</span></p>

<h2>            Dial-up Internet access following a Windows 7 clean install.</h2>
                    I am planning to do a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit on a Vista 32-bit system. I use an AOL&nbsp;dial-up connection to get to the Internet. Will this be an option after the clean install is finished?

            Thanks for the reply. I had run the Upgrade Advisor and there were no compatibilty issues identified&nbsp;with the modem. I did the clean install of Windows 7 64-bit to a second clean drive in my system. I was able to to have the Network connection wizard attempt
 to connect to AOL, but each time I got an authentication error - either user ID, password or authentication protocol. Since the user ID and password I used are successful when I use them on Vista, I have to assume that the AOL authentication does not like
 the way Windows 7&nbsp;attempts to authenticate me. The AOL dialer is what I usually use, since I don't need all the AOL stuff they push.<br />
I know that AOL has released their 9.5 release that is compatible with Windows 7 64-bit as well as 32-bit, but it is not available as an update file that I can download using another system. The update takes place over the live connection.<br />
So my issue is I cannot update any software (or even activate Windows 7) because I cannot connect to the Internet. Any suggestions, other than taking my system to a place where I can connect through a broadband connection? If I don't get a solution by this
 weekend, that is what I will do.<br />
<br />
One interesting aspect of all of this - after I did the clean install of Windows 7 on my 2nd disk drive I am able to boot either Vista or Windows 7 at startup. Nice touch - it allows me to keep the system alive for my daily work. I'm not sure how they did this
 - maybe through the bios, or maybe through the MBR on the 1st disk. I haven't changed the bios, and as far as I know the 1st disk was not touched by the clean install.<br />
<br />
A second interesting aspect is that the clean install on the 2nd disk, which is a clean, formatted 500 GB disk, shows that its capacity&nbsp;is only about 8 GB. I assume that the clean install created an active partition of a size that is just enough to contain
 the OS. Wonder what this means as I add applications. When I look at the disk when booted into Vista it shows the correct size - as does the Acronis disk management software - but these are running from Vista.

            Hi Nancy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The machine is missing the correct C++ Runtime components for your type of system. (x86 or x64).
<br />
<br />Installing the following update resolved the issue.

            Greg, this is my third attempt today to reach you about your suggestions to resolve my issue.&nbsp; I don't want you to think I am compulsive, but I am so anxious to get my system fixed so that all my applications will work.&nbsp; My question is for you to tell
 me which of the 4 suggested downloads in your list you want me to download?&nbsp; I don't know enough about the policies and restrictions of this help forum, but are you and I able to exchange phone numbers so that we can talk?&nbsp; You mentioned in your original reply
 to my issue that I should feel free to ask you any questions.....problem is that I am not receiving any reply.&nbsp; It would be so helpful if we could talk by phone.&nbsp; Please reply ASAP.

            Hi Nancy.  I'm sorry I was delayed but we have been at the funeral home today planning my father's funeral.
<br />
<br />You would install the 64 bit downloads on a 64 bit system.  If you have either installed now, I'd uninstall them first in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features and restart the PC first.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes.

            First and foremost, my condolences upon the loss of your father.&nbsp; I apologize for my compulsive replies yesterday!&nbsp; I successfully uninstalled a C++ 64 bit program, but there is another one, Visual C++2010 x86 redistributable 10.0.40219,&nbsp; which will not
 allow me to uninstall.&nbsp; When I attempt to uninstall it, it reads "Error 1719.&nbsp; The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed.&nbsp; This can occur if you are running Windows in safe mode, or if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed.&nbsp; Contact your
 support personnel for assistance".&nbsp; Shall I just leave it there and start downloading the sites you suggested?&nbsp; BTW, your list consists of 4 downloads, two for x64 and two for x86.&nbsp; Do you want me to download BOTH of the x64 sites in your list, one after the
 other?&nbsp; Another thought....why do I have a&nbsp; C++ x86 in my program list at all?&nbsp; My system is x64.&nbsp; Could that be why it won't allow me to uninstall that one??
        </p>

            Hi Nancy -
<br />
<br />You can reset Windows Installer to see if that helps:   
<br />
<br />Right click task bar to open Task Manager.  If necessary show More Details
<br />
<br />On Details tab look for msiexec.exe, highlight to End Task.
<br />
<br />Now try install or uninstall again.
<br />
<br />If this doesn‚Äôt help you can try to Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/...</a>
<br />
<br />This can also be symptomatic of corruption.  I would go over the integrity of your install by working through the steps for Windows 10 Performance Troubleshooting:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can try installing the 64 bit VC++, and if that doesn't help I'd also install the 32 bit (x86) ones which sometimes are required too.       
        </p>

            I used the Fix download and it worked!!&nbsp; Now both of the Visual C++ program have been uninstalled from my system.&nbsp; Now, just so I understand what you want me to do next, you want me to download ALL 4 of the listed downloads in your original message to
 me??&nbsp; Even though I have a x64,&nbsp; and two of the downloads in your list are for x86? &nbsp; Forgive me for being so unsure of myself, but I need your assurance that I am doing what you want me to do. &nbsp; I need you to tell me to download all 4, one after another,
 OR tell me which ones I should download.&nbsp; I know I am repeating the same question to you over and over, but please stay with me.&nbsp; So far, you advice has been spot-on!!<br />

 just don't know if you want me to download all four, or just one or two, etc.&nbsp; My system is x64.&nbsp; Hanging by my fingernails!!&nbsp; Thanks for everything you are doing for me.

<h2>            Party chat choppy and slow</h2>
                    <p>I know this topic has been beat to death but I have tried everything suggested and still don't have a solution.&nbsp; When I try to chat on party it isnso bad that iris unusable.&nbsp; It is very chippy and distorted.&nbsp; I am using the regular Xbox controller and have a turtle beach headset plugged into it.&nbsp; Originally I was using my phone as a hotspot and was getting a moderate or strict nat type.&nbsp; So I hooked until through my computer and got an open nat type.&nbsp; Still didn't work.&nbsp; Found out my connection slowed down.&nbsp; So then I changed to a dedicated Verizon hotspot and get an open nat type with good connection speed and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; If inswitch to game chat instead of party chat it works perfect.&nbsp; Any ideas why game chat works great and party chat won't?&nbsp; Any other things i can try.&nbsp; I'm only able to use hotspot because I live in a rural area and no internet service is available.&nbsp; Thanks in advance</p>

<p><span>I will suggest you to install the latest Windows 7 compatible Bluetooth device driver from the system manufacturer‚Äôs website and then check if the

<h2>            Xbox One Game Streaming has suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I'm suddenly unable to stream from Xbox One to my laptop altogether even though it worked fine before.&nbsp; The Xbox One is wired to my Linksys EA6500 router served by an **** tg862 cable modem&nbsp;and, as a test, I wired the laptop as well.&nbsp; Although the Xbox App sees the Xbox One, connects and then connects to stream when stream is selected, no streaming actually happens with the exception of sometimes getting audio only.&nbsp; The only error I see is "Network Quality Issues" at the lower left hand corner with bars in red.&nbsp; After a few seconds, connection is lost altogether.</p><p><br /></p><p>To emphasize, this happens with the laptop connecting wireless and wired.&nbsp; Also, the laptop has no problem streaming video using the network and the router is connected to a Smart TV, which also has no trouble streaming video.&nbsp; I've changed all cabling to CAT7 with no change in this behavior.&nbsp; NAT is open.&nbsp; In short, it doesn't appear to be a hardware issue.</p><p

<h2>            Stop Code&#58; System Service Exception AND Kmode Exception Not Handled, Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>recently my computer started crashing all of a sudden when I was working. It happened multiple times, like every 10-15 mins. My computer is close to 5 years old, I have window 10 on it.</p>
<p>I had installed a new software called Anaconda Navigator prior to the issue. I'm not sure if this software is the culprit, but I had uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to check the latest update, and everything is up to date (including the driver). I also try to do the scanning and repairing drive (command prompt = chkdsk /f /r), but there is no clear indication given.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the green screen with the message:</p>
<p>Stop Code: System Service Exception.</p>
<p>What Failed: WdFilter.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, the Stop Code changed into</p>
<p>Stop Code: KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p><span>What Failed: WdFilter.sys</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Same message, each time.<br />
Any help is very much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Computer Info:</p>
<p><span>Windows version 1709 (OS Build 17074.1002)</span></p>

            Hi ShanSu97, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />Below are methods to troubleshoot the issue as well as to upload the .DMP files so I can analyze them to see if they will help point us in the right direction.
<br />
<br />We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the OneDrive or other file sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.

<br />
<br />3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping). 
<br />
<br />Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and vents. On a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the 
<br />vents. (Of course  remove ALL power prior to opening the case.)

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN -  REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />   
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

            Hi  johncraig8
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I changed the default to Google and it is searching in Google only not in Bing. Try following and check after each step. Make sure Google is still set as default. -
<br />
<br />Repair / Reset Edge
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Edge &gt; Advanced Options 
<br />
<br />Repair - No data will be impacted.
<br />
<br />If repair doesn't work - Reset - You may lose some data in Edge including browsing history, cookies and settings but favorites may not get lost. You are recommended to take a backup of your favorites before resetting (Open Edge &gt; Click the 3 dots in top right corner &gt; Import from another browser &gt; Export to file)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Okay, I figured it out. Although it required a series of steps.
<br />
<br />Open Google.com in a new tab Page.
<br />
<br />Click 3 dots&gt;Settings&gt;Search for Address bar
<br />Click Manage Search Engines.
<br />You would see google appear in the list.

eu queria o jogo no Idioma em PT-BR s√≥ que n√£o consegui de jeito nenhum, ai fui no idioma do console e j√° est√° tudo em Portugu√™s.<br />
Ai a minha duvida √© a seguinte, o jogo Lan√ßado fora do Brasil independente de Pais tinha que pegar o idioma em PT-BR na hora da instala√ß√£o?<br />
Ou os jogos lan√ßado fora n√£o pegam o Idioma em PT-Br por serem de fora?</p>

<p>Flabiano84, eu comprei 6 jogos nos Estados Unidos. quando eu fui colocar no meu xbox one aqui no Brasil, ele rodou de boa tudo em portugu√™s. Detalhe: meu console √© modelo americano e a l√≠ngua do console e a regi√£o est√£o pro pt-br. Isso responde sua pergunta.??
 &nbsp; </p>
<p>al√©m disso, o que importa √© o idioma do console. Se em ingl√™s ou espanhol ou qq outro a lista que ele mostra. O que estiver l√° se o jogo for um triple A, ele vai pegar no idioma atual do console. No meu caso estava em pt-br. &nbsp; A
</p>
<p>coisa muda de figura quando o jogo √© indie. Neste caso, muitos desenvolvedores apenas colocam a l√≠ngua inglesa.
</p>
<p>Ai a instala√ß√£o e o jogo na gameplay em si ser√£o em ingl√™s por mais que o idioma do seu console xbox one seja portugu√™s ou espanhol ou qq outro diverso de ingl√™s. &nbsp; Essas s√£o minhas considera√ß√µes. Espero ter ajudado e qualquer coisa conversa com a gente
 via rede social xbox live. me add como amigo l√° pra a gente, se poss√≠vel, jogar algum jogo ae com o fim de pegar algum achievement trocar ideia sobre xbox</p>

<h3> colin z.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 doesn&#39;t show installed USB driver in device manager</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install two USB drivers to my laptop with Win10 home 64bit --&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port from&nbsp;</span>http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html</p>
<p><span>2. XR21V1410 USB UART &nbsp;from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.exar.com/content/document.ashx?id=1596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.exar.com/content/document.ashx?id=1596</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The installation goes on smooth without any error. However, device manager doesn't show the two drivers in "Port" section even after restarting the system. Without the driver working, I won't be able to use my USB device
 for the serial communication.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also tried this on another Win10 home installation which behaved the same way. However, both of the driver could be found on win7 OS and the USB device works well when plugging in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a possibility that the update didn't take effect during their (drivers) installation that's why they don't show up in the Device Manager. You can try to manually update them. See this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/927524/you-cannot-install-a-device-driver-by-using-its-installation-program-i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link </strong></a>and go to "<strong>To locate the .inf file and manually install the driver</strong>". You can also try connecting the devices to other USB ports. It would determine where the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update after manually installing the drivers.</p>

<h2>            Cortana seems to have lost the ability to search for local &#40;Music&#41; files&#33; &#40;I moved user folders from C&#58; to D&#58;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I would have expected to put a filename or foldername in Cortana, and it would appear in the list that pops up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.windowscentral.com/how-search-files-windows-10-cortana</p>
<p>suggests there used to be a 'My Stuff' filter available with a single click!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now local content is two clicks away : [Filter &gt;] [Music] !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bizarrely, Cortana now responds to 'Show my music' by looking in Documents, but .MP3, .WMA are not files of type-document, so they don't appear, even if you put your music in /Documents/!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>'Show my photos' or 'Show my pictures' seem to work, even with a moved folder!</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Open Music folder' - Cortana searches for that instruction on Bing!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Could this be because I moved my User files from C: to D: ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved the pointer back, but not the files!<br />

<p>Checked the location is indexed - had to select it by hand, which seems poor show.<br />
Now have both /Music/ folders indexed!<br />
Moved one file to C:</p>
<p>'Items indexed' incremented by 1</p>
<p>Found it !</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Cortana to search /Music/ on D: ?<br />
It doesn't follow the 'Moved' location of the 'This PC &gt; Music' pointer/shortcut !</p>

<h3> kaydi77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vizvox and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Vizvox is a program that is like skype. I have Windows 10 and the program won't run on 10. I have changed the compatibility for windows to pick it up at windows 8 and called vizvox customer service and they recommend that I download windows 8. First of all,
 I would rather not download windows 8 and have another operating system on my new computer. Second, in this day and age you're telling me that seriously we can't find a solution or an app to fix this problem? Help...are there any other options other than downloading
 windows 8 and having dual operating systems for this 1 program?</p>

            <p>To be clear, you are trying to utilize a piece of software whose own 'support' has told you that they do not support the use of their software with Windows 10 (even though it is *not* going away) . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say it is time to drop that software and go with someone who does like their customers; however, the software in question may have cornered a market?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as their recommendation: you probably do not have downgrade rights (you did not mention "PRO") anyway - so you would be purchasing and installing an older operating system *if* the rest of your system has support with Windows 8.1 anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a "Vizvox" issue. &nbsp;The only solutions are the ones they give or something similar (like running a Virtual Machine for this one cruddy application...)</p>

<p><span>Hi,<br />
What is the antivirus installed on the computer?<br />
Looks like the Antivirus software is conflicting with the updates.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
I suggest that disable/uninstall the Antivirus\Firewall and then check for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</strong> Please make sure that you enable\re-install the antivirus software after performing the test to keep your computer protected.<br />
</span></span><span><span><strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong>You may also run Windows Update Troubleshooter that would help us diagnose the issue better.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Windows Update Troubleshooter would work only on Windows 7. Let us know the operating installed on your computer.<br />
Access the below link for more information on Windows Update Troubleshooter: </span>

<p>Hi Manasa,</p>
<p>&gt; What is the antivirus installed on the computer?<br />
&gt; Looks like the Antivirus software is conflicting with the updates.<br />
&gt; Step 1:<br />
&gt; I suggest that disable/uninstall the Antivirus\Firewall and then check for the issue.<br />

There is no permanent Antivirus/additional Firewall to disable/uninstall - just Windows 7 Defender/Windows 7 Firewall. (I'm using this computer mainly offline so I don't need extra Antivirus software.) As written in my original post I've used the Kaspersky
 online virus scanner once and in the meantime I could make sure that temporary installation had been removed completely.<br />
<br />
&gt; Step 2:<br />
&gt; You may also run Windows Update Troubleshooter that would help us diagnose the issue better.<br />
&gt; Windows Update Troubleshooter would work only on Windows 7.<br />
&gt; Let us know the operating installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
Windows 7. I've tried the Windows Update Troubleshooter but it reported only:<br />
"Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem"<br />
I clicked on "View detailed information" and got the following information:<br />
<br />
#####<br />

<p>The other error: 0x08402405 appears according to research to be due to antivirus software&nbsp;interfering</p>
<p>You state you have no permanent anti virus software because you don't need it as you're not online much.<br />

<p>You may have an infection which is preventing the system from updating.</p>
