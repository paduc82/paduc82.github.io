    <title>KB2838727 gives error code 800F0900 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobplantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB2838727 gives error code 800F0900</h2>
                    KB2838727 is "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems." I do not use automatic updating but was notified of this update about two weeks ago. Every time I try to install with Windows Update, it fails with
 error code 0x800F0900.<br />
<br />
I first posted on the IE forum and was given several things to try. None of them worked. One responder said this is an Update problem, not an IE problem and suggested that I post here.<br />
<br />
I tried downloading the file and doing a manual installation. The link on MS's website gave me (when I clicked on x86-64) the file "Windows8-RT-KB2838727-x64.msu." The manual installation also failed.<br />
<br />
I even tried to Refresh my system, but now that will not work.<br />
<br />
At this point I am thinking that I will need to do a clean install and start all over again. I am willing to do that, but I would like to know what went wrong so that I do not repeat my mistake.<br />
<br />
My Windows 8 is running on a 240GB SSD. Samsung's utility says it is good. I also have Ubuntu 13.04 installed on a separate (HDD) disk. I used EasyBCD to create a dual-boot system, using the Windows 8 boot manager. I set all this up in December 2012 (updating
 the Ubuntu in April), and it has been working fine -- until this KB2838727 update failed a couple of weeks ago. Updates for Windows Defender have installed just fine. I just now installed KB2267602 (Definition 1.153.470.0).<br />
<br />
How do I debug and fix this problem?<br />

<p>Try that.&nbsp; Its a download page for a&nbsp;slightly aggressive&nbsp; windows update trouble shooter fix-it thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know.. I see a quick search that the following fixed one computer with that error number.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;from Command Prompt (admin) some basic&nbsp;scans...</p>
<p><strong>ChkDsk /scan</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>SFC /ScanNow</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly wont hurt anything and may fix a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said it was an internet explorer update - I don't know what you have and have not done but my first thoughts were to close all your messengers and browsers and from control panel / Internet Options, on the Advanced tab is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset.&nbsp;&nbsp; To reset internet
 explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Read what it says!</p>

<p>original title:Has my Computer been Hacked?</p>
Last night someone phoned me claiming to work for Windows. This person convinced me that my computer was seriously infected with multiple viruses. The caller directed me to a company called Fix on Click to remove these viruses and I ended up paying them to
 remove the viruses. Later I became worried that this might be a scam and that these people may have done something to my computer. I am a novice on computers and really need some help or information about this. Thanks!

<p><span>You may be infected with malware (that's one of the things they could have done). Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix
 this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span></span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span></span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span></span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span></span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span></span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Go to Start / Control&nbsp; Panel / Security Options / Windows Firewall and make sure it is set to on.&nbsp; If not, do so.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Otherwise, mohdrafi's suggestion of&nbsp;<span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a>&nbsp;is
 what you should do next.&nbsp; Worry about making sure your computer is secure before worrying about reporting these people to the authorities - you can always do that once you know your computer is not open to being accessed remotely or infected with one or more
 forms of malware.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            In game sound won&#39;t play through earphones or bluetooth headset</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 10 on a late 2013 iMac through bootcamp. </p>
<p>Certain games will not play through earphones but will play all in-game sound through the speakers, while any other sound on the computer will come through the earphones.
</p>
<p>For example, if I play Fallout 4 while listening to a podcast or music on Spotify, any sound from Fallout will play through the speakers while music&nbsp;plays through my earphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked up this problem before, and no one else seems to quite have the same problem as me (most problems are along the lines of no sound coming through earphones at all). I've read the solution of&nbsp;disabling the speakers in the sound options but that
 just cuts out the sound from the game entirely, even when the earphones have been made default.<br />
I seem to have luck with my Bluetooth&nbsp;headphones. More games will play their sound through them than through my earphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you help me?</p>

            Hi Jeremy,<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to verify, were you able to have this kind of set up work before? What changes have you done prior to getting this issue? Have you toggled the audio settings on the game itself?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

    <title>Master Browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qqwertyy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Master Browser</h2>
                    Recently my workgroup computers (windows 8.1) have stopped appearing in my home network. I checked the Computer Browser in Services and it was in a stopped state (even though it is set to Automatic). I started it manually but a couple of seconds later
 it stopped and it keeps doing this so I can only access my network computers by manually typing the path and this is not the solution. If I run NET VIEW in a DOS prompt it shows error 6118 and says the list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available.
 I have checked the registry and MAINTAINSERVERLIST is set to YES. Why has it started doing this and how do I fix it? Thanks

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I've fixed the problem. It didn't like the fact that I tried to force my main PC to be Master Browser by editing the Registry. I removed the entry, rebooted and my network returned as normal. Master Browser elected a NAS device to do the role. I don't
 know why it failed to work as the registry entry had been there successfully for some time but as it is now working, I'm not complaining. Thanks for trying to help.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change colors in Personalization page in Windows 10</h2>
                    On one of my PCs (laptop) after upgrading to windows 10, I go to Control Panel, then Personalization page. &nbsp;It says to change sounds and colors click on the theme. &nbsp;When I do, there are no additional options or links to change the colors or sounds associated
 with the theme. &nbsp;Mainly I want to change the window title bar colors but there is no option to do this. &nbsp;Why doesn't this PC give me the option? &nbsp; It works on another PC.

            I changed the Theme to Flowers, Windows 10, etc. and there is still no option to change color of the window title, etc.<br />
<br />
The White Windows title is ugly and I really need to change it.

            Seems strange that Microsoft would remove a feature that previously existed in all versions of Windows (i.e. the ability to control the color of the window title bars). &nbsp;I hope this is added back in a future update.

            We need an option to change window(s) frame colour(s) from white to something else. I personally don't like plain white design. Please, Microsoft, include window(s) colour option in your future updates. Thank you!

            <p>Why did you do that?!</p>
<p>Personalisation is, for a lot of users, one of the most important things. I want my laptop to be mine, to<strong> feel
</strong>mine.</p>
<p>Now, it feels like someone enforces me to use an UI that I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and by the way, override is available:</p>
<p>http://www.windowscentral.com/replace-those-white-title-bars-windows-10-colors-theme</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give use the option back to customize our own PC.</p>
<p>Meaning: </p>
<p>- Possibility to change the white title bars to our own liking.</p>
<p>- Easily available slide bar for every possible color combination, like in W7 and W8. Not one that can only be summoned using run Prompt (control /name Microsoft.Personalization /page pageColorization)</p>

            <p>I'm generally unable to speak for the decisions of designers: I can only try to help make your system better for you.&nbsp; Generally the feedback on this has been strong.&nbsp; It is a feature request, though, so I can't imagine it fitting into one of the cumulative
 updates if they decided to make it happen.&nbsp; (Those are generally limited to bug fixes, as I understand it.)</p>
<p>

            <p>The option isn't there, anymore, but if you are like me and have a disability, you can contact the Microsoft disability accessible desk and they can do a one time override.&nbsp; I suggest while you are on with them to save several different themes because you
 will be stuck with whatever you choose unless you get them to do another override.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wish they would bring this feature back.&nbsp; I cannot look&nbsp; at a stark white background and I have yet to find high contrast themes that work with my particular disability.&nbsp;

<h2>            outlook 2003 won&#39;t send or receive</h2>
                    I am having a problem&nbsp;with Outlook 2003 with Windows XP.&nbsp; When I test my email accounts (3 in all)&nbsp;with my ISP server&nbsp;, I get the nice green check marks that the send and receive to POP and SMTP are OK and a test message is&nbsp;sent to my ISP .&nbsp;....but Outlook
 2003 will not send or receive an email.&nbsp; The emails just sit there and when I hit send/receive nothing happens and no error messages.&nbsp; I know the test email was sent Ok because I see it when I check on a different computer.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything including reinstallng Outlook 2003 (Office 2003), disabling my Norton 360, running in safe mode, changing every setting possible,&nbsp;and still messages sit in the outbox.&nbsp; Before all the problems, I did have to do a repair on Windows XP
 because of a boot up problem with Windows.<br />
<br />
About ready to give up on Outlook 2003 and just starting using my ISP provider (Cox) for getting emails...because that is where I can actually see the test messges were sent.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

    <title>Uninstall Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 bit software - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Uninstall Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 bit software</h2>
                    <p>Purchased "NEW"Desktop PC per-installed with OS Windows 7 Pro SP1 64bit software; recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Would like to uninstall Windows 7 SP1 64bit to have a clean Windows 10 Pro OS, however, I am told by Microsoft Techie I spoke too by e-mail that I cannot uninstall the Windows 7 Pro 64bit because certain files are required by Windows 10??????!!!!!!
</p>
<p>This makes no sense to me-anyone out there who has a solution without compromising my existing Windows 10 OS?</p>

            <p>Makes no sense to me either. You can use the reset function which will remove all programs and set Windows 10 to the out of box version but you can opt to keep personal files. (I would backup though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use the Media Creation tool to create&nbsp;Windows 10 media&nbsp; and clean install. Just make sure you have drivers for the hardware in the PC and it is supported by the manufacturer with Windows 10 drivers.</p>

            <p>If you upgraded to Windows 10, that's all you have. There is no Windows 7 to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You *could* remove everything on the drive and reinstall Windows 10 cleanly, but I don't recommend that. It's a lot of trouble and it's unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Response appreciated; respectfully, the fist sentence is not correct-yes, I did download/upgrade from Microsoft Windows 10 and followed all instructions, it was straight forward and no difficulties, system works great but, I do have Windows 7 Pro 64 bit
 files in my registry.</p>
<p>Further to which as previously stated Microsoft techie told me uninstalling windows 7 Pro not an options!!??; files required by system????????</p>
<p>One is cognizant of a clean install/difficulties but, hopeful of a less convoluted process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perplexed if Microsoft techies do not have a solution-who does?</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Difficulties</h2>
                    
<p><span>Just bought 12mo subscription to Xbox Live. &nbsp;Everything was working as it should, but when my son was ready to play, we got the message that there are "too many profiles on that storage device". &nbsp;We tried to delete some profiles,
 but are not able to access Profiles under Settings (we are not even given the option to choose it.</span></p>

<p>Hi there, just so we're clear, to get to the profiles to delete them you're doing the following:
</p>
<p>1. Go to settings and select System.</p>
<p>2. Select Storage.</p>
<p>3. If you don't connect any external storage devices to your console, select Hard Drive. If you do use external storage, instead select All Devices.</p>
<p>4. Select Profiles</p>
<p>From there you should be able to delete any unused profiles, if you intend on re-downloading the profile at any time, make sure to select 'profile only' when deleting them.</p>

<h2>            Ark won&#39;t download or install from Microsoft store on windows 10. error code 0x87e105dc</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">I've been trying to download Ark onto my PC from my Xbox one account from which I had originally purchased it, but every time I even attempt to install it it gives me an error code. I've been no reddit for hours, I've been on several
 forums and in Microsoft chats reviewing others experiences in trying to fix the issue but I've had no luck. The error code is 0x87e105dc and Microsoft doesn't even recognize this as a real error code so I've had no luck with any official advice either, all
 I want to do is play ark on my PC by downloading it from the Microsoft store, I already own it and I've clean booted my PC, hard reset it, cleared my mac address on my Xbox, reset my account and re-downloaded it and literally nothing has worked, and as much
 as I would love to drop another 70$ on ark I feel as if I should just simply be able to download it but that's just not the case.. If anyone at all has any advice please help..</div>

<p>Please clarify the scenario.&nbsp; Sounds like you are using&nbsp;a browser?&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if&nbsp; "Fullscreen"&nbsp; really means&nbsp;using a&nbsp; Modern UI Fullscreen&nbsp; app&nbsp;(e.g. MUF IE) then when you "click on your first" monitor you may be activating your Taskbar on both
 monitors.&nbsp; The Taskbar is a Desktop feature, so you would be seeing that instead of the MUF app.&nbsp; However, then, instead of "fullscreen exits" it may only be suspended.&nbsp; E.g. have you tried using Alt-Tab or Win-Tab to see if there is any sign of the missing
 app that way?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Error__</h2>
                    I get this error message quite frequently when I open certain applications or search for files.<br />
It asks me if I want to either restart the program or search online for a fix...<br />
I can usually hit restart the program, but once or twice I had a system freeze.<br />
It is Windows explorer (the search function for files and folders and NOT Internet Explorer)<br />

            Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; If so, we may be able to use System Restore to go to a restore point BEFORE the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days worth of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt doesn't work, try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; You will have to re-install
 any programs you installed including updates between now and the restore point.&nbsp; You can use Windows Update for the updates but you'll have to remember the programs on your own.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command Prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if it does have such corruption post back here or try to analyze it with
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a>.<br />
<br />
While still in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r to run a check and potential fix of your hard drive for bad sectors.<br />
<br />
If this does not fix the problem, then the next logical step would be a system repair/upgrade for which we need a genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Let us know if you can get your hands on one.<br />
<br />
Good luck! And please post back one way or the other.

</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus or other security software&nbsp;that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription
 that has not expired, contact the developer to find out about Windows </p>

</p><p>Will the process of upgrading to Windows 10 delete any of the files that I have stored on my computer?</p>
<p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,
 custom dictionary, application settings). </p>

<p>My buddy and I have been playing through this game cooperatively and have experienced no problems until now. We get to the part were Master Chief watches the helmet cam footage and halfway through the cutscene it kicks us out. It keeps doing it at the EXACT
 same spot every time. It kicks me to the main menu and freezes for my buddy who has to hard reset his Xbox 360. What's going on!?</p>

<p>Here's the first stupid question: Are both of your discs ok?&nbsp; Namely the host's?&nbsp; If it is it could just be a glitch in the save.&nbsp; Every time you start over, is the host loading from the same checkpoint?&nbsp; If yes, I bet that's the problem.&nbsp; Probably just
 a glitch that keeps being loaded.&nbsp; If I were you guys I would start the level over again completely.&nbsp; Should fix the problem.&nbsp; If the disc is fine, you restart the level, and have the same problem in the same level, idk.&nbsp; Maybe then you two you switch up the
 person hosting, and start the level over again.&nbsp; If none of this works, you should trying clearing your Xbox cache.&nbsp; You two should be doing this every few weeks or so anyways.&nbsp; Good maintenance.&nbsp; Info on that

<p>*UPDATE* We got around the game stopping glitch by simply skipping the cutscene. Both of our discs are brand new, we both have the game installed to our HDDs, and we restarted the level numerous times including switching hosts. Obviously the game just didn't
 want us to watch that cutscene in co-op...</p>
<p>Thanks anyway for the suggestions Thookins. If anyone gets stuck like this, either skip the cutscene and hope that works, or do what Thookins suggested.</p>

<h2>            Web link keyboard shortcut</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use a keyboard short cut key that would open to a specific url link irrespective of wherever i am on my laptop. I am using a PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: &nbsp;how would i command my computer using Ctrl F3 if i am on microsoft office, desktop, file explorer etc to open up Google Chrome immediately (my preferred web browser) to the specific url?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that i should find a shortcut key that is hardly used for any other application so i don't muddle other necessary keyboard short cut key commands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
