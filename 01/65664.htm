<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access machine in Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you start to boot before windows loads.<br />
Select Safe Mode with network and you can test and fix.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options<br />
if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
Have you added new hardware or updated drivers lately?&nbsp;Also check in Windows Updates to see if new<br />
drivers were added. What antivirus do you use? You can try disabling or even removing to see if that<br />
helps (see the maker's site for removal tools and/or special instructions since many will leave trouble<br />
causing remnants if you just uninstall in Add/Remove programs).<br />
<br />
I would download Avast, remove the other antivirus - REBOOT - then install Avast so you have protection<br />
to test with. If you later decide to remove Avast (which is what I use) get their uninstall tool.<br />
<br />
Avast - Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and Network running.<br />
(Double Click Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields - Terminate those you do not use.)<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed
<br />
hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see
<br />
if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run
<br />
hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's
<br />
manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so,
<br />
contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system
<br />
startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system
<br />
choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the
<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> <br />
option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it
<br />
does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must
<br />
restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for
<br />
problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the
<br />
device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you can't tell from Event Viewer run SFC /scannow and check its log for the possibel errant driver.<br />
These will also help clear out any corruption.<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Update fails with 8024402f.</h2>
                    When we try to run Microsoft Update, it fails with error code 8024402f. We have reformatted our hard drive and re-installed Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. Windows update works fine, but after we install Office 2010, and we apply Microsoft Update, it fails with
 8024402f. We have tried disabling anti-virus, deleting the Software Distribution Folder, run the Fixit, and updating the time/date widget, all to no avail. However, if we disable update from checking for other Microsoft products, Windows update works fine
 again. Also, we have several other computers on our home network which are able to use Windows Update with no problems. Microsoft Update fails for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Office 2010. This troubleshooting would indicate the problem lies with
 Office 2010 trying to update.

            I tried all of these methods, and none of them fixes the problem. Once again, this problem only occurs when trying to update office 2010 using Microsoft Update. Windows Update will update windows fine so long as Microsoft Update is not included. All of
 our other computers on this network are able to update with Microsoft Update, including a Windows 7 Professional 32bit laptop with Office 2010 32 bit.<br />

            These suggestions did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; Windows Update still does not work for Office Home and Business 2010.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to download the lasted Office Home and Business 2010 by downloading the trial version and then use my existing Product Key?&nbsp; This should have all of the latest updates included.&nbsp; Perhaps, having the latest patching and updates would resolve
 the issue.&nbsp; I don't have a way to log in to a windows account because I originally purchased this product as a CD on Amazon.Com.<br />
<br />
Please let me know.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

Would it be possible to download the lasted Office Home and Business 2010 by downloading the trial version and then use my existing Product Key? This should have all of the latest updates included. Perhaps, having the latest patching and updates would resolve
 the issue. I don't have a way to log in to a windows account because I originally purchased this product as a CD on Amazon.Com.

            Hello If still having the problem look at possible solution pasted below<br />
I have had this problem as well and tried alot of recommendations but none apparently worked.On the update box on my computer has&nbsp; recent time update tried had NEVER.<br />
So if you have this maybe this will work for you I tried quite a path with all having the same apparent result with the error 8024402F Coming up.<br />
This is such a mad mad world we live in (murphies law seems to be in control.)<br />
Do exactly the opposite what is logical<br />
First set your update setting to NEVER RECEIVE UPDATES, then UNTICK the two boxes below if they are ticked (one about any one can update,) and the other about being informed about available updates.(That one a box comes up are you shore you want not to be notified
 etc.)<br />
NOW USING MURPHIES LAW&nbsp; Leave all settings as is eg NOTHING SHOULD WORK<br />
NOW CLICK THE UPDATE BUTTON SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU NOW CAN UPDATE.!!!!!<br />
After updating ,check for further updates after the first batch.<br />
Then the settings can be put back to normal eg Receive updates Automatically, the tick the other two boxes.<br />
<br />

    <title>Holding left-click drawing rectangle on screen - What is this&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> span-unit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Holding left-click drawing rectangle on screen - What is this&#63;</h2>
                    On my desktop and some webpages, I can hold the left mouse button down, drag it, and it draws a rectangle - like it's selecting an area. Releasing the mouse button makes the rectangle disappear and me wondering what that was all about. The area inside
 the rectangle is not highlighted in any way. However, when there is an image (photo) on the page, SOMETIMES (without moving the mouse) the left-click highlights the image in shaded blue even if the pointer is not on the image. It's like Paint - where the rectangle
 selects an area to be edited, only this gives no options or menus to consider after the rectangle has been drawn - then disappears with the release of the button. What is this?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>This by design and you do not have to worry about it. It is normal.</span></p>
<p><span>When we left click on desktop or any blank (white) space away from any folders and drag it will show
 you a rectangle, also a shaded area inside the rectangle will appear.</span></p>
<p><span>The function of left click drag is to select so it keep looking for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>The only two things you need are Windows Defender and Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>The best security program sits between the chair and the keyboard.&nbsp; Do not let other thing be added to any download you do.&nbsp; Also only get the downloads from the maker of the program.</p>

<h2>            Multiple BSOD prior to and after reinstalling Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am running windows 10&nbsp;on a 64-bit OS desktop with Intel Core2 Quad CPU @ 2.66GHz.&nbsp; I started getting "System Thread exception not handled" "page fault in nonpaged area" and system service exception" BSOD messages about a week ago.&nbsp; I deleted and reinstalled
 several drivers, ran chkdsk /f /r, windows memory diagnostic tool, memtest86 for three passes, system file checker and nothing came back with any errors.&nbsp;No viruses either according to Malwarebytes and AVG.&nbsp;I started getting "memory management" "driver IRQL
 not less or equal" "KMode exception not handled" APC Index mismatch" BSOD so I reinstalled Windows 10 and am still getting BSOD errors.&nbsp; When I ran driver verifier I got stuck in a reboot loop.&nbsp; I called Western Digital and they said they'd send me a new HDD,
 but is this the problem?</p>

<h3> brennansstuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change volume level when plugging in headphones</h2>
                    My computer speaker is 50% and when I plug in my headphones, it stays at 50%. By the way I have Realtek High Definition Audio Driver which is version R2.75 and I also don't see advanced settings in Realtek HD Audio Manager. I like that function when I
 plug in my headphones, it changes the volume to like 8% when my headphones are plugged in, but when Realtek High Definition Audio Driver, the headphone and speakers stay the same volume.

    <title>Windows 10 taskbar keeps changing width - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radjazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 taskbar keeps changing width</h2>
                    <p>I use the button to go to the desktop at the far right of the taskbar a lot, unfortunately it is not always there when I click at the bottom right corner. My taskbar keeps changing its width, moving the desktop button and usually parts of the clock off the
 screen entirely, where I can't see or click on them.</p>
<p>This usually happens after I've been using a program that maybe is a little older than Windows 10 is used to, but nothing else is ever harmed and I don't see why the taskbar should be.</p>
<p>Usually it gets wider than normal, but just now it actually got shorter.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e8e082-7ed9-46c6-bc09-91dc321bd54f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e8e082-7ed9-46c6-bc09-91dc321bd54f" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b839a6c0-f60c-4dd6-8987-99d1378ecaec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b839a6c0-f60c-4dd6-8987-99d1378ecaec" /></a></p>
<p>There is about an inch of space between the edge of the screen and the end of the taskbar. Not as inconvenient as it extending off the screen as it has every other time, but still inconvenient.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is happening and what I can do to fix it? It makes me sad when I can't easily reach my desktop.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Picture Manager</h2>
                    Why is it so difficult to do a simple task, like resizing photos in Windows 10? Aren't updated programs meant to make life easier not harder?&nbsp; I have used Microsoft Picture Manager for many years and it has always been the program of choice for my photos
 when it cmoes to resizing for email etc. Now I find I can no longer access it and the Photos App I have does not give me any resizing options whatsoever. I have tried the Edit and looked Properties as suggested in other answers, but I don't have the option
 to even do that.&nbsp; Is there a simple way of doing this in Windows 10? I wish I had stayed with Windows 8.1 as I've had nothing but problems ever since I updated my software.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox one slow to sign in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one slow to sign in</h2>
                    
<p>Trying to figure out what might be causing a increase in sign on time. &nbsp;This started with the new experience update in early December and prior to it my xbox would sign in instantly. &nbsp;Since the update xbox sign in takes upwards of 60-90 seconds and although
 it is not deal breaker it is annoying.</p>
<p>Anyway, checking to see if anyone has had experience with this or have any additional troubleshooting tips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>usually that is a sign your profile may be slightly corrupted , but it usually causes other issues as well ...go into settings and remove all the profiles , (make sure you have the email and password to get them back ) &nbsp;after you remove the profiles , shut
 the xbox down by holding the xbox logo on the console for 8 seconds till it powers down , while it is off , unplug your modem and router for 30 seconds to clear them also , plug the modem and router back up and when they are online , turn the xbox back on
 , when it is all the way up . re add your main profile ...it may sit there and sync a little while but all SHOULD be good afterwards ... other than that it might be a connection issue with your router...</p>

    <title>art and craft software wont run on windows 7, 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wife of mr w  say:</h3>
<h2>             art and craft software wont run on windows 7, 64 bit</h2>
                    i have a new lap top with windows 7 installed the 64 bit version and when i&nbsp; installed my art and craft software it installed ok but wont open this is excactly what it tells me, a problem has developed with greenstreet art and craft which has prevented
 it from being able to continue running,this may be because you tried to preform an operation for which you did not have sufficient user privilages,or it may be an internal error. this was&nbsp; brand new software never used bought to replace what i thought was
 an uncompatable version that i had had for a few years i tried to use it running it on variouse compatability modes of windows but still got the same error message so decided to buy a new version that was advertised as compatable with windows 7 but when&nbsp; it
 arrived this morning its exactly the same one has i have already got and does the exact same thing when installed&nbsp; i have tried to go onto the publishers website but get an error message telling me it may be busy or no longer their and having tried this a
 few days now i think the site is no longer their, i have now run out of ideas and wondered if anyone else would be able to help. thank you ps i forgot to add that i had this software installed on my old windows vista 32 bit laptop and it worked perfect.<br />

<p>Hello wife of mr w,</p>
<p>According to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center, it does show the GreenStreet Art and Craft Studio 2009 is compatible with Windows 7. However, on the GreenStreet Web Page Product Information for the software shows it to be compatible with&nbsp; Windiows Vista
 32-bit and 64-bit software. <br />
<br />
When you downloaded the software, did it provide a 64-bit installer for their software?<br />
<br />
These are the options you have to try and get the software to work on your computer.<br />
<span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</span></a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p>Please reply back with an update and let us know if this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
