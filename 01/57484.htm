<h2>            Gamers Hangout&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I am in the process of building a new social hangout for gamers of all walks of life. I am looking for anyone that is skilled at writing, graphics, or would like to help promote it. If you would like to know more you can kik me at HunterW87 or chat with
 me on Xbox One.<br />
<br />
This is still in the beginning stages and has a ways to go to be what I want it to be, however in time it will get there with the right people helping and dedication.<br />
<br />
I am also looking for mods to help keep the site friendly, and 2 females, and 2 males to help me as owners to run the site as a whole.
<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you all soon.</p>

    <title>Korean characters displaying incorrectly in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alralr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Korean characters displaying incorrectly in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed and moved over my fonts from my previous computer. &nbsp;I already installed Windows' Korean language pack and its fonts, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I view multiple webpages (including FB) in Korean/hangul, the phonetic character for "H" renders as a character that's... *not* the character for H.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>On webpages, using Google Chrome (most recent version):</p>
<p>Correct:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">신화
</span>&nbsp; Incorrect (screencap):&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a653543a-4254-4f24-8be0-b4fa2f144ee8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a653543a-4254-4f24-8be0-b4fa2f144ee8" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>On my system, including menus, system tray, etc. in Win 10:</p>
<p>Correct: <span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">
한</span>&nbsp; Incorrect (screencap): &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8413989f-6c9d-4a7f-bcf5-959cdcd5ed56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8413989f-6c9d-4a7f-bcf5-959cdcd5ed56" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The characters display *correctly* when I look at the same pages on my Android smartphone using Chrome. Additionally, when I look at the source code for the webpages in question (on the Win10 computer), the *code* shows the correct character. (So Windows
 is doing something to interpret and display it differently than my previous Windows 7.1 set up?)<br />
<br />
HELP! And THANK YOU in advance for any assistance you can provide.<br />
</p>

<h2>            egalaxtouch update Windows 10 2015-08-05</h2>
                    I have installed windows 10 my Asus Ep121 and everything works beautifully. However today Windows installed a 3rd party update, egalaxtouch, an HID touchscreen driver, that completely disabled the touch function of my tablet. The pen worked as designed
 but touching with a finger or gestures were disabled. The cursor remained on the screen and would follow my finger opening and closing blue squares. After many Google queries, 4 hours of my time, and help from a friend I was able to go back to the previous
 HID touchscreen driver and everything worked again. The up date is not listed in the " uninstall updates " and there seems to be no way of removing it. I am afraid that it will just reinstall the next time windows updates. Any ideas on how to prevent this
 happening? I am not sure I like the idea of having no choice about updates, particularly non- Windows ones.

<p>You may need to forward ports for a particular game. Also with your particular router, you will want to avoid setting up or entering the following:</p>
<p>1. 360's MAC address into it's settings.</p>
<p>2. static IP.</p>

<p>Run a speedtest <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Your modem/router might be at the end of its life cycle and just slow down because of it. If the results seem to be as usual then it's gotta be your settings or maybe even the console</p>

<h3> numbahana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype number call-in incoming call from telephone audio&#47;visual notification for contact landline number in my contact list</h2>
                    <p>I just acquired a new Windows 10&nbsp; and laptop and signed in to the Skype service that is integrated into the Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; I have had a Skype-in number (USA) for more than a decade and always maintain&nbsp; high balance of Skype Credit in my account.&nbsp; I had
 been using Skype on an older laptop that was upgraded to Windows 10 OS, but I did not used the OS-integrated Skype.&nbsp; Never experienced any problems until&nbsp; this new laptop [BTW - laptop current on all OS and other updates]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue --&nbsp; no audio (beep/ring) or visual (small pop-up to click on to answer) notification of incoming Skype-in calls.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detailed description:&nbsp; I am signed into Skype and have the Skype window with my contact list showing whenever I expect a telephone-to-Skype incoming call, but there is no sound or visual notification that the call is coming in.&nbsp; I go the next step and open
 the contact details/call&amp;SMS history window for the specific caller.&nbsp; Still no sound notification when the caller dials me at my Skype-in number.&nbsp; The only way to complete a call is for me to "Skype-out" call to the contact's telephone number.&nbsp; After the contact
 answers, I tell them to call me back -- only then does the incoming call notification work, both audio and visual.&nbsp; The error is consistent -- happens every time the caller tries to call me [this is the daily family call which we have been doing for years
 when I am traveling] &nbsp; &nbsp; Other details:&nbsp; I am connected to the internet via a Lan cable on a highspeed fiber connection at my end; caller is calling from a landline.&nbsp; Laptop is high-spec</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have not yet tested on with other call-in contacts and have not tested on&nbsp; Skype-to-Skype calls, but need to solve the above issue because it is my primary use of Skype.&nbsp; I am sitting at my laptop with headset on waiting for the call, but no notification
 that it is coming in!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello <strong>reginaldsurridge</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, are you trying to clear the temporary internet files via <strong>
Storage Settings</strong>? If not, then you can try doing so by going to <strong>
Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage</strong>. From there, click <strong>Free up space now</strong> &gt;
<strong>Remove files</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also do this using the <strong>Internet Options</strong> settings. Just launch the Internet Options via Cortana search and on the
<strong>General</strong> tab - <em>Browsing history</em> click <strong>Delete...</strong>, check everything and Delete. Note that this will clear all browsing history, and everything that is checked. Also make sure that you are logged in as Administrator in
 order to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Thanks for following up. Can you tell us What version of Windows 10 do you have on your PC? Also post a screenshot of the folder image with the lock icon so we can have a closer look. A lock icon could mean that the folder is owned by other users in a group
 your PC belongs to, or it may have been encrypted. </p>
<p>

<p>The circumstance is normal. Be content the folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible, as Mark Isi suggests, the folder actually is also used by other profiles on the computer. Then, only the files of your user account will be visible to delete.</p>

<h2>            Why was the middle finger emoji removed&#63;</h2>
                    So I've recently noticed that the middle finger emoji that had been added to Windows has been removed from the emoji picker? What's the deal Microsoft? It this just a big&nbsp;🖕 to those who want that emoji? Do you realize you're now the only major player
 that doesn't have the option?

            Hi Uncle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />They're one of the largest corporations in the world so we kinda have come to expect them to be mainstream on things like this.  I'm surprised to hear they ever had it.  I'll bet it got sent up the chain until someone vetoed it, probably a lawyer.  It is universally vulgar, after all.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  Your title will help others find it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h3> teffy  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Communication to the NDAS service failed&#34; error for my beloved Ximeta NDAS</h2>
                    
<p>Just finished upgrading my laptop from&nbsp;XP to Win7 Home Premium. I installed ximeta_ndas_3.72.2080_20100113 software, and see the NDAS icon on the taskbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I hover the pointer over the icon, it displays, "NDAS Device Management, NDAS Service is not available."</p>
<p>Using the NDAS Device Management software on my Vista computer,&nbsp;I created and exported&nbsp;an NDAS&nbsp;registration file named "NDAS Ximeta Drive.ndas" to a USB stick.</p>
<p>I plugged the USB stick into the Win 7 laptop, clicked on the registration file, and get&nbsp;an "NDAS Device Management Error"&nbsp;message box which says,</p>
<p>"Facility: NDAS 0x0001<br />
Error Code: 1 (0x0001)<br />
Communication to the NDAS service failed."</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting the Win 7 laptop and the Vista PC.</p>
<p>I see Windows Service "NDAS Service" on the Vista PC, but not the Win7 laptop.</p>
<p>I see Windows Processes "ndasmgmt.exe" and "ndassvc.exe" on the Vista but&nbsp;only&nbsp;"ndasmgmt.exe"&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Win7.</p>
<p>Argh - your help is appreciated!</p>
<p>My router is connected via ethernet to the Vista PC, the Win7 laptop and the Ximeta.</p>

    <title>Automatic updates in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachel scheidt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic updates in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I use a laptop and I have struggled with having the specific function of choosing when an update occurs ever since I got it. With Windows 10 I no longer have an option to choose when an update occurs only being told that the update will apply when I am not
 actively using my laptop. This means that my updates will come at 4AM when my laptop is closed. This is extremely dangerous and hazardous for my laptops health. In the past a friend of mine's laptop MELTED because an update occurred while it was closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious answer I'll probably be given is to turn off my laptop before I close it, but it's simply not an option for me. I would much rather choose when an update is applied, or at least be given a notification that the system would like to apply an update.
 I'm not trying to fight the system, I'm simply trying to protect my laptop from receiving an update without being notified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A secondary issue I have is the updates of apps without my permission while I am using my computer. It produces stress on my CPU and my computer will suddenly come to a startling halt and I have no control in trying to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to have the choice of when any update, system or otherwise, occurs on my laptop. This is an extreme inconvenience and a major issue of safety that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to halt updates and choose when they may be applied and someone knows of it, please enlighten me.</p>

I use Windows 10 too and i was realy annoyed, caused by the new Windows Update. So i was looking for a way to get the old Windows Update back and found this thread. With all of your tips and tricks, i made a new Control Panel entry, to&nbsp;<strong>get the old Windows
 Update back</strong>&nbsp;- as good as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, I made it only for&nbsp;<strong>english language</strong>&nbsp;and only for&nbsp;<strong>64 bit Windows 10</strong>&nbsp;machines.<br />
<br />
In the case, that this is not the original Windows Update from Win7 / 8, I will need some people who can test it if it realy works well. After "installation" you will have a new Control Panel entry, what looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d6891af-2fe4-498b-a89c-286b13292ae1" /><br />
<br />
As you can see, i use the german OS and made it english so everyone can read it.<br />
<br />
You will have four different links, which i will explain now a little bit:<br />
1. "Show or hide Updates" if you click here or directly on the Logo or "Windows Update" itself, it will open and start wushowhide.diacab with UAC prompt<br />
2. "Open new Windows Update" if you click here, the new and original Windows Update for Windows 10 will open</p>
<p>3. "Delete installed Updates" if you click here, you will be redirected to the Installed Updates page.<br />
4. "En-/Disable automatic Updates" if you click here, accept the UAC prompt an Enable or Disable the annoying automatic Updates. If you hit this link, just the UAC will come up and first you won't see anything. Just go after hitting this link to the advanced
 settings page for Windows Update and you will see this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c230ac26-cc53-49ec-a668-9cca8b114493" /></p>
<p><br />
You here you see the german version of the advanced settings page, but in the drop-down-menu is now "Never search for Updates" enabled and you realy have to search for updates manually.<br />
..and if you wish to get the automatic Updates back, just hit the link "En-/Disable automatic Update" in the old new Control Panel applet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I made everything with CMD or PS and i use VBS for some little things.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1EleAtb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Get the new old Windows Update back!">If you wish to give it a try, please download it here from OneDrive.</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I wish to create the best possibility to get my own hands over Win Update, if you have more ideas to implement or to change please tell it to us. Maybe i can tweak something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That was all for the first time.... Thank you for reading!<br />

<h2>            irda DRIVER PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>When running driver update, message is driver already installed, but in general property the message This peripheric does not work, Windows cannot load the drivers for this peripheric.</p>
<p>When I check in directory&nbsp;\WINDOWS\system32\drivers, I find&nbsp; the system files irenum.sys and MoslrUsb.sys&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Scubapro and they informed me that the Window beta versions was supporting the Irda drivers, but noy anymore.</p>
<p>It looks it is a deliberate action of Microsoft to banish Irda medias.</p>
<p>as anybody&nbsp; an answer and/or solution &nbsp;and how alert Microsoft of the consquence for many users ?</p>

            <p>Hello Jean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate, if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I suspect that the issue is caused due to incompatible drivers. I see you telling that the device is working fine with previous version of windows. Then try installing the drivers in compatibility mode.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website. Remove the existing driver from your PC through Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8&nbsp;or 8.1 or 7 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>

                    <p>Is MS going to get us some update or fix or trade-in for the compromised L5V-00001 Sculpt keyboard set?&nbsp; Like maybe will we be able to send in for a new dongle that doesn't have the mousejack vulnerability?</p>

            <p>Using the mouse is part of it, but isn't the real vulnerability in the dongle?&nbsp; The vulnerability sheet I saw listed the mouse, but the set I have also includes a dongle that is listed as vulnerable.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it was a mouse problem I wouldn't be very concerned,
 but I really like the keyboard and I can't get anything like it in a wired version.</p>

            Yes, the problem is in the USB receiver (dongle). Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that the dongle is able to receive data from both mouse and keyboard. I'm not an expert in wireless security and I wasn't study how the MouseJack works, but I think when the
 dongle is able to receive keyboard commands then an attacker is able to exploit it for attack. This is what I understood from video and website.

            Anybody know if I disabling the "Microsoft Hardware USB Mouse" in Device Manager will help mitigate the problem? I never use the mouse piece of my Sculpt mouse/keyboard set. I wonder if disabling the mouse will make the dongle resilient against the attack?

            After installing the February 13, 2018 security update, KB4074588 (OS Build 16299.248), some USB devices and onboard devices, such as a built-in laptop camera, keyboard or mouse, may stop working for some users.
<br />
<br />Cause
<br />This issue occurs when the Windows Update servicing stack incorrectly skips installing the newer version of some critical drivers in the cumulative update and uninstalls the currently active drivers during maintenance.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />If the following KBs are are installed, right click each then click uninstall:
<br />- KB4074588
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />
<br />Confirm the drive letter for the Windows image. Usually D: –&gt; dir d:
<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17 
<br />
<br />If you are running 32 bit Windows, run this command instead:
<br />
<br />dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />    Reboot.

<h2>            Skype Video call screen image size</h2>
                    <p>after updating to the latest version of skype for ipad the video image of my contact is drastically decreased,
</p>
<p>one of the rhings i loved most about Skype was the full-screen image on my ipad pro, now the image is a narrow space in the middle of the screen with wide black bands left and right, smaller than Viber or ICQ for example, is there an adjustment for this
 or am I now stuck with this giant step backwards ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>DID someone really think this is an improvement !?!?</p>

<p><strong>Generally, when you right click on a folder, there will be a customize tab, so a user such as myself can add a picture to the folder.</strong></p>
<p>I have researched this problem. I have tried going to the folders origins by clicking 'open folder location' then clicking properties, still no customize menu. One page mentioned edited the registry keys, I hesitantlyh tried that, but still I have no customize
 tab under folder properties.</p>

            I found the answer to my problem. I had to manually reset the tab in regedit.
<div><br />
<div>Go to:&nbsp;</div>
<div>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \ Directory \ shellex \ PropertySheetHandlers</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is a key titled:</div>
<div>{ef43ecfe-2ab9-4632-bf21-58909dd177f0}</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mine had a space in front of it, the space was making it so the tab would not come up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you do not have the key add it and the tab will come up, if not, make sure the key is exactly as shown.</div>

<h2>            Does Windows Security add a flag &#40;a shield&#41; to a program&#39;s icon when it blocks the application&#63;</h2>
                    I recently got infected with the Win7 Antivirus 2012 virus. I eventually erased the partitions on both my boot and data drives, reformatted, and reinstalled Win7 Professional on the boot drive. Since then, I've been driven crazy because I keep seeing small
 shield flags show up on program icons. At first, I thought it was the virus, but I've noticed that each of those files has the "block" Security property. Does Win7 itself modify the program's icon?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Are you referring to program shortcut icons on desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Is the problem specific to particular program icons?</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;What happens when you try to open a program using the shortcut on desktop?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may hover the mouse on program icons and see if it gives any error message.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Items with the shield need an administrator privileges to run.&nbsp; Most of these things will give you a UAC pop-up or need to be run by right-clicking and choosing "run as administrator".
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The icon indicates that the shortcut will prompt with a UAC dialog at Start.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The UAC (User account control) Shield on the Programs indicates that you need elevation to run the program, which
 means you need to run the program as an Administrator. </span></p>
<p><span>This is not normal but does not do any harm as well. I suggest that you turn off UAC and check if you have the
 same issue. You can refer the below link for more information on this: </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such
 as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</p>

<h3> puteruzer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft GPS receiver and Windows 10 AU</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a Microsoft (Pharos) GPS-500 SIRF III for years with Microsoft Streets and Trips, including with Windows 10 1511. I just updated to the Anniversary Update 1607 (build 14393.351). When I plug the GPS receiver into a USB port, my computer
 chokes and I need to restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to&nbsp;do to allow the GPS receiver to work with 1607 as it did with 1511?</p>
<p>

            <p>I don't get that far (to check Device Manager).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is working just fine. When I plug in the Microsoft GPS receiver then I get the blue screen error (stop error). "PC ran into a problem... We're collecting information... etc. It shows a QR code and a windows.com/stopcode reference (which wasn't
 helpful). </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scan, it tries to restart. If I leave the GPS receiver plugged in, it goes through the same exercise. If I take it out, it starts just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the stop code shown is IRQL_not_less_or_equal, but it goes by so fast I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is something about this older Microsoft product that the new Anniversary Update does not like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you will be able to help me.</p>

            I believe that the problem is down to the GPS driver not being digitally signed.&nbsp; Apparently if you hold down shift whilst restarting you can go in to advanced options and restart using option 7 with the device driver signature requirement removed.&nbsp; However
 if you restart with the GPS attached it crashed as per previous comments, it won't allow the install without crashing out..

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, Rev. (I assume that from your screen name.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to restart several times as you suggested. I tried both holding down the Shift key and tapping it repeatedly.&nbsp;Each time the computer thought the Shift key was stuck! Hence I could not get to Option 7. But I will keep trying.</p>

            <p>I finally found the Option 7 you mentioned and chose to bypass the driver signature requirement. THAT WORKED. I CAN NOW USE THE MICROSOFT GPS RECEIVER. THANKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder, however, whether my computer will be vulnerable to other drivers that do not have a digital signature. When I went back to Option 7 (with the expectation of re-enabling the driver signature requirement) the only option I seemed to have is the original
 option. So my computer may be permanently set to bypass the requirement. But that is for another time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your suggestion.</p>

            <p>I think you are telling me that when you try <strong>your</strong> idea (to disable driver signature checking), it doesn't work on
<strong>your</strong> computer. Strange!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered whether a restart would restore the driver protection. After the first restart&nbsp;following choosing Option 7 (and the successful plugging in of the MS GPS receiver), I restarted&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;and then plugged in the GPS receiver a second time.&nbsp;I did
 not get the BSOD this second&nbsp;time.&nbsp;So, if&nbsp;driver protection was restored, something was changed. I can see no evidence that the driver file was changed. Perhaps it was added to a list of acceptable drivers. But this is only a guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will pursue this further by a complete shutdown (not a restart). If that leads to a return of the BSOD I will report it here.</p>

Do you have any Winamp plugins installed? If so, remove them and then try and start the application again.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description I understand you are facing issues with error: "the stub received bad data" while trying to access third party software installed on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you are referring to reset of the operating system with keeping files when you say: "&nbsp;i have tried everything even resetting my windows"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that when you perform reset of the operating system all the applications/ programs and updates will be removed from the system and you will have to re-install all of those.</p>
<p>When you perform repair of the operating system, this will repair all the Windows files and programs and not the third party applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists with third party applications, I suggest you to repair the programs and check if it&nbsp;helps.</p>
<p>Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>keys from the keyboard, click on <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, click on programs you are facing issues with, check if there are U<strong>ninstall</strong>/
<strong>Change</strong>/ <strong>Repair </strong>options for the programs.</p>
<p>If found, I suggest you to repair the programs and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Update us if you are still facing issues with the above error message. We will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Do you happen to have an nvidia card and drivers in the 368.xx branch?&nbsp; These errors and and many others occur only if I install 368.22, 368.39, and the latest hotfix version 368.51.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I roll back nvidia drivers to 365.19 all these problems go away.&nbsp; I and many others are having this error and have reported to nvidia, but so far they haven't reproduced it.&nbsp; Maybe Miscrosoft guys could talk to the Nvidia guys and work this out?&nbsp; I don't
 know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have nvidia and 368.xx drivers, then you can ignore this... Or maybe it sparks something Microsoft can check.&nbsp; Note that some people have tried insider builds of windows 10 and still get these errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read up on guru3d and the geforce forums if you would like.&nbsp; There are some really detailed posts of people with these same problems and all the steps they've gone through to try to narrow down the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The threads are quite long now so here are some links to relevant posts</p>

<br />
Microsoft takes security seriously. It is for your protection.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>Details</strong><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Please&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT&nbsp;</strong>ask the community for methods to bypass security methods adopted by Microsoft. The community are not allowed to provide you with instructions, videos, products or links to other sites that tell you how
 to bypass security methods. This goes for methods bypassing Family Safety settings too.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>ANYONE&nbsp;</strong>who posts such information will have their post edited/removed and could be banned from this community. If you see that someone has posted password cracking techniques or products on this community, please
 report them so the Abuse Moderators can handle it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>If you are using your favourite search engine to search for these techniques, you should be very careful. Sites that claim they can crack passwords may not be able to. Software you download to break security
 methods may do more harm to your computer than good. If this does happen, Microsoft takes no responsibility for your actions or any damages incurred (even if someone broke the rules and posted links to such software in this community).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">What the community can do, however, is give you instructions to reset your password.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>What do I do if I lose/forget my password</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Microsoft has articles published on their support website that give you information on how to reset your password. Links to these articles will be provided in this article for you to use.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Popping Audio</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>

<p>I have 2 xbox ones in 2 different setups. Both suffer from popping or crackling audio. One is hooked up to a Onkyo receiver and the other is straight to a tv. I have tried different HDMI cables. Reset all settings. Changed audio
 settings. Fully power cycled everything. It is awful and happens all the time. Very annoying. Anyone else have these issues?</p>

<p>It could also be described as clicking or crackling.</p>

<p>I figured it out. It only happens when I am downloading or installing a game. I have confirmed this to be the case on both of my Xbox one consoles. Does it regardless of internal or external drive. As soon as I stop the download the popping/clicking sounds
 go away. Start it back up and they come right back. It even caused AC Unity to run even slower than it normally does. Sometimes I also noticed sound would almost slow down.</p>
<p>Called up support to let them know my findings.</p>

<p>I get the same thing through my turtle beach headset, and as with you it seems it only happens when downloading and installing games. It also happens on destiny a bit but I'm guessing because that game is completely online. So the sound would be affected
 by that maybe. </p>

<p>Damage Inc 84. &nbsp;I'm having the exact same problem. &nbsp;Audio crackling and popping, etc. when install/downloading another game. &nbsp;What did Microsoft say? &nbsp;Obviously this is some sort of bug introduced with the last update. &nbsp;I never noticed it before.</p>
