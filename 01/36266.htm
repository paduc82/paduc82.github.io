    <title>Spell Check - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Spell Check</h2>
                    I understand that I cannot have two languages selected at the same time in chat messaging. But, is there a way to turn off spell check? My primary language is English, but when I type a word in Spanish it keeps getting changed (incorrectly) by the spell
 check feature. Very frustrating.

            Hi JerryKomassa,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Skype uses spell check from your computer settings, so these spell check and autocorrect settings will be buried in your Mac Settings.
<br />
<br />Try doing the following:-
<br />
<br />1. Go to 'System Preferences'
<br />2. Select 'Keyboard'
<br />3. Select the 'Text' tab
<br />4. Uncheck the option to correct spelling automatically.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>Hello Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by driver issues. For us to determine its cause, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Was it working fine before?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made on your PC prior to this?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages? What happened when you connect your phone to the computer via USB cable?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For help regarding the driver for your mobile, we suggest that you contact your phone manufacturer or post on their forums for better assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there be anything else, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h2>            Want to know about device manager in Windows 7 computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: understanding device manager help.</p>
<p>I have had recent issues with both an older laptop and a &lt;year old desktop, but virus and malware doesn't seem to find anything.&nbsp; I can't feel comfortable without understanding more about the operating system.&nbsp; For instance . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should motherboard or system board entries be duplicated in device manager?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have 42 system devices "revealed" and only 29 when hidden; is this normal?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also have 58 non plug and play drivers - this is where I feel a virus could be lurking.&nbsp; Is there a reference of what is normal or typical for standard operating devices?</p>
<p>I have the same question in regards to task manager items - I have several items that are duplicate (wisptis, unsecapp, task.eng, ccSvcHst.exe*32, svchost . . .) and researching on the internet will nearly always have conflicting views because, of course,
 individual operating systems with personalized user preferences and the complexity of virus/malware attacks.&nbsp; I expect those sites are like playgrounds for perverts - a good place for malicious computer files to hangout for the unsuspecting and vulnerable.&nbsp;
 Is there a reputable reference to explain what a normal set of system processes and services should resemble?</p>
<p>Also, why can't I change some of these questionable files' permissions?&nbsp; I had removed any "trust" from anyone's programs to "see" if suspicious behavior correlated with programs requiring access, but I received notices (rather I read notifications in virus
 protection history) that hundreds of firewall rules were being created arbitrarily despite my wishes.&nbsp; Even more disconcerting was the virus protection's "No Action Required."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please, if anyone can shed some light into my darkness about anyone of these topics, then this smile's for you :) and if you are like me, trembling in the corner in fear of a predator, here is my virtual hand to hold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>It is not possible to say the amount of items showing in device manager to say since it depends on the amount of hardware that is connected
 to the system. The same applies to task manager as well.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Before you rename and take ownership of files, I would suggest you to be careful as to what you do with the files as they may be system specific and tampering with them could cause serious issues.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Regarding the firewall, any time you can install an application that requires access to the internet you will be prompted with a warning as to whether or not they would allow the changes to the firewall. The firewall does not change unless given permission
 by the user. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Additionally, make sure to </span><span>keep their antivirus up to date and run scans on a regular basis. This is the best protection against attacks and infection of the system.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Disabled password strength settings but they&#39;re still in effect</h2>
                    I have a computer I'm working on that came with password strength settings like 14char min password with meeting complex password requirements. I am not using the computer in a&nbsp;situation&nbsp;where this is practical. So I've been trying to change these settings
 and I seemingly have. I went to the local&nbsp;security&nbsp;policy and changed them. I even checked them and they set properly even after a restart they are still there. However when I try to change a password the&nbsp;computer&nbsp;still tells me that it's not reaching the
 password length requirements no matter how much longer than the min requirements it is.

<p>I am assuming that your computer is not on a Domain.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly how you changed the password length settings, but in case you didn't do it this way, try using the " net accounts " command.</p>
<p>Bring up a command window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") then enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net accounts /minpwlen:0<br />
Where you can replace "0" with the required minimum password length in range 0-127</p>
<p>For more info on the "net accounts" command, see here:</p>

<p>No it is not on a domain but it is on a network where other computers are.</p>
<p>Also there was an option on the local&nbsp;security&nbsp;policy options under the password policy to set that. I will try your way and see what happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway it didn't work. It there a way to apply a policy to a group that requires it still? This account is part of Administrators, Users groups and could it be possible that the admin group has special settings requiring this?</p>

I will try that because I do think it might be that. I was doing some remote playing around with it yesterday and I opened that up but I can't remember what happened although I remember that at some point one of the tools wouldn't let me modify something so
 I'll look at that and see and reply here. <br />

<h2>            Downgrade Win 10 to Win 7 failed, now only starts in safe mode, not normal mode</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell D630 Latitude, was happily running Win 7 Ultimate SP1 32 bit. I made the mistake of opting for Win 10 (for future use) and then rolled back to Win 7.</p>
<p>I do not have the original (OEM) cd, just the sticky label.</p>
<p>Now it will not boot into win 7 and I have to use shift+F* to get the option to boot into safe mode with networking. I've run all I can find by way of diagnostics, nothing improves.&nbsp; However, in safe mode I have access to all my files and programs.</p>
<p>Aha! I thought, I'll cunningly use the Win 10 Upgrade and go back to Win 10 - foiled again, as you cannot run Win 10 upgrade from safe mode - and I cannot get into normal mode.</p>
<p>Using cmd, I tried the recommended rebuild of the BCD file - nothing doing as "bootrec" is not recognised as a command.&nbsp; The boot directory is in c:\windows (not c: ) but there are only five directories, (.) (..) (DVD) (FONTS) (PCAT) and no files and 0 bytes.</p>
<p>Before I give up and clean install Win 7 Pro (losing Ultimate) is there any way I can make the machine boot normally from either 7 or 10 please?</p>

<p>Sounds like you knew you were going to 'roll-back' when you did the upgrade to Windows 10; making a fresh

 further in the past and also maintained your daily / normal backups - all may still retrievable as you could

restore the older System Image</a> and then restore your last known-good backups and be practically (likely less a few programs and updates) back where you were with an activated and working OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already had media (which it seems you have Windows 7 Professional media maybe, for some reason...?) you could try an

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, assuming this Windows 7 Ultimate was a later legitimate upgrade from Professional for you (which would assume that is the OS the system originally came with) and you have the product key for that... &nbsp;You may be able to

download the ISO for Windows 7 Ultimate from Microsoft using said product key</a> (as it is unlikely the upgrade would be OEM - which means you need to contact Dell (re: my first suggestion) to get it) and then you would have Windows 7 Ultimate media to use

<p>The fact you can boot into Safe Mode is generally a good sign... What is the message you get when booting into normal mode that prevents it from making it all the way...? Sounds like possibly a device driver if it gets into Safe Mode and not into Normal

            <p>Many thanks for such a detailed response, Shenan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First my observations on your questions -</p>
<p>The laptop was purchased from a charity who had dozens donated by a company upgrading their equipment.&nbsp; I have looked more closely at the label and see it is a Vista Business OEM, perhaps previous owners found (like so many others) that Vista was not for
 them, or maybe it came pre-installed (OEM) and they wanted harmony with their other computers. I may have to install the Win 7 Pro from the laptop I am replacing as that certainly has the correct, registered OS.</p>
<p>However, assuming the charity or the original company owner has upgraded legitimately, I'd like to resume with Ultimate.</p>
<p>Yes I intended to install Win 10 to register it before the expiry of the offer, but wanted to go back to 7 as I did not want to learn a new OS as well as replacing my Desktop - I use the devices for translation software that is a real pig to re-license to
 new machines or to clean-installed drives.</p>
<p>Why no full system image? Shortage of disk space and time before the deadline were main considerations, besides, all my files were backed up onto my desktop. It is the program and OS I'd prefer not to lose.</p>
<p>Repair install? Here is what I read "<span>You
<strong>cannot</strong> use a <strong>OEM Windows 7 "Factory" Restore/Recovery </strong>
type of installation disc that came with or created from a store bought computer to do a repair install with. These can only be used do a clean install instead."Yep, my version is Pro not Ultimate and is OEM.</span></p>
<p><span>ISO download - product key does not match the installed OS, and I don't particularly want a Vista repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right - trying to start normally. I get the "Starting Windows" and flashing logo for about a minute, then a blue screen with loads of messages headed "A problem has been detected and windows
 has been shut down to prevent damage - run system diagnostics - remove or disable newly installed software (I guess that means Win 10?)&nbsp; then restart, use F8 and select safe mode"&nbsp; It doesn't say what to do after safe mode!</span></p>
<p><span>It goes on " tech info 0x0000007F plus more numerals"</span></p>
<p><span>Then "Collecting data for crash dump, initialising disk for crash dump, dumping memory to disk 100"</span></p>
<p><span>This blue screen shows for a few seconds (I photographed it to get all the words) then a black screen displays for thirty seconds or so, then the system restarts and loops through the whole
 cycle continuously.</span></p>
<p><span>At the&nbsp; advanced boot screen, I can select safe mode with network.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I have since enabled boot logging report (ntbtlog.txt ) and disabled automatic restart on sys failure. Started normally, then when failed into safe mode - Win 7 Ultimate (!) -&nbsp; and read ntbtlog.&nbsp;
 Lots of drivers loaded </span>then hundreds more not loaded. The last loaded were Drivers\ mpsdrv.sys, mrxsmb.sys, mrxsmb10.sys and the last mrxsmb20.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that give you some idea of what is happening please?</p>

            <p>Another oversight - when I say I cannot use the Win 10 upgrade assistant, it starts but stops because it says Windows needs to be activated before upgrading - Activate Now.&nbsp; When I try, that is when it says I cannot activate from safe mode.&nbsp; Odd because
 it was certainly activated before I installed Win 10, and Win 10 itself was activated.</p>

            0xc0000185 - Means that your computer can't communicate with the CD drive. <span>
</span>. <br />
<br />
When you start your computer, choose the boot option for <span>
System Recovery</span>. This will vary based on your manufacturer, it's often accessed by holding F8 or F10 during startup BEFORE you see Windows beginning to load.
<br />
<br />
(A message may appear when you first start, at the top or bottom of the screen, telling you what key to press)
<br />
<br />
This should boot your computer to Windows 8 advanced recovery features. From here you can have Windows automatically attempt to repair your computer. If this option doesn't work, I'd recommend bringing the computer back to the place you bought it (Most computers
 come with a base 1 year warranty)

<p>Let me explain what the Home feature is and does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what console a profile is signed into it will always be able to play its digital games and use its subscriptions (gold, EA access, Game Pass).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each Profile can set one console at a time as its HOME console and any other profile on that console can then Play its games and share its subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each profile can switch which console it has set as home FIVE times a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to save from purchasing the games 2 times and purchasing the subscriptions 2 times you if the games and subscriptions are on your account you would want to set your sons console as your accounts home console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain it another way this is how my setup is&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 consoles and all the games and subscriptions are on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Console 1 is in the living room is set as the home console and any other profiles on that console can then play my games and use my subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Console 2 is in my bedroom the only other person that uses that console is my wife if she wants to play one of my games or use my subscriptions then she would have to be signed into my profile at the same time that she is signed in to do that.</p>

            Short answer: The Home setting is what allows you to share your gold. So you would need to set his console as your Home so he can access the gold on his console.

            <p><span>Mann Manohar,</span></p>
<p><span>Waited three+ hours for a MS tech to call me (apparently, Win10 has everybody scrambling for awhile; no surprise).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All problems were completely resolved by remote connection within about 20 minutes. The root cause was probably a third-party program misbehaving.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note that I'm 75 and have had a few strokes (</span><span>Doc says I only have three or four functional brain cells)</span><span>, so the techy stuff gets a little tougher as I go along, despite a doctorate in defense information technology way back
 in the mainframe days. Doc also says I'm gonna die; he just doesn't know when yet. Humph. We'll see.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway, I'm excited over Win 10. Smooth and fast so far. Regards, and have a great day!</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Sid%20Meiers%20Gettysburg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Sid%20Meiers%20Gettysburg</a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>You might need to contact the manufacturer and see if they have any updates on the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Now the only option left is to run the game in the XP Compatibility mode and see if you can run the game without issues.</span></p>

    <title>network adapters causing system crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whats_the_answer  say:</h3>
<h2>            network adapters causing system crash</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems with Microsoft downloading network adapters and causing my computer to crash. I am not able to stop these downloads and I do not need them.
 I have tried disabling the unwanted adapters but then Microsoft downloaded some more onto my computer.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t understand why they get downloaded as I am supposed to give permission for Microsoft updates and I have set the permissions for installing drivers
 to â€˜neverâ€™.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What can I do to stop the downloads and stop my computer crashing?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am using Windows 7.
</p>
<p>My problems&nbsp;coincided with an update/renewal of McAfee Total Protection but I have removed that and am now using Norton 360 and itâ€™s still happening.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft community forums. As per the description, Windows update is offering drivers for network adapters and is getting installed without prompt, this causes the computer to crash. Letâ€™s perform few troubleshooting
 steps and try to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which is the update that caused this issue? Does the update installed successfully?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able to access Internet successfully?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To check the updates that were installed on the computer, refer:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See which Windows updates are installed</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try running the Network Troubleshooter and see if it fixes the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer this link to do the same:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Open networking troubleshooters</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the driver has not installed properly, I would suggest you to update the driver in clean boot state and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To place the computer in clean boot, refer the article: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Once you are done with clean boot, please follow
<strong><span>step 3</span></strong></span><strong><span> </span></strong><span>in the article to put your computer back to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, c<span>heck the event viewer for error message related to this program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Event Viewer is a tool that displays detailed information about significant events (for example, programs that don't start as expected or updates that are downloaded automatically) on your computer. Event Viewer can be helpful when troubleshooting
 problems and errors with </span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> and other programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer this link to open the Event Viewer:</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp;I have not had the problem for 24 hours -- but it could happen any moment.</p>
<p>Currently I am still not taking Microsoft updates and still have driver installations set to 'never'. So I just have the 3 'usual' drivers (Atheros AR5B93 Wireless Network Adapter, Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet and Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport
 Adapter) which cause no problems. If I do the checks you suggest it won't show any problems, will it?, because everything is currently OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the problem occurs, the Miniport disappears and is replaced by:</p>
<p>Microsoft ISATAP Adapter</p>
<p>Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #2</p>
<p>Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #3</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (IKEv2)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (IP)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport ((IPv6)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport ((L2TP)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (Network Monitor)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (PPPOE)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport ((PPTP)</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (SSTP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and when these were 'disabled' and installations set to 'never' the following were installed;</p>
<p>Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #4</p>
<p>Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #5</p>
<p>Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I allow automatic driver installations I will probably get a system crash within 20 minutes. If I allow this to happen, can I do the check you suggest in safe mode with internet access?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is an ACER Aspire 5338 bought in Oct 2009. This is the first time these problems have occurred.</p>

            <p>OK, here's an update...</p>
<p>Today I got the blue screen and shutdown again -- but extra network drivers hadn't been downloaded!</p>
<p>So now&nbsp;I don't have any idea what's causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted the suggestions above but network troubleshooter didn't find any problems -- but then I'm not experiencing any problems with connecting to my printer or the internet (I use WiFi for both).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't dared try a clean boot because of the dire warnings against doing so if you are connected to a network.</p>

<p>I looked at the event log but it all means nothing to me.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your latest reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now decided the network adapters are a red herring as I get 'a crash' without the long string of mini adapters. It also crashes whether or not I'm connected to the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some days are fine and then another day it'll crash after 5 or so minutes. It reboots normally OK and then either crashes again or is fine for the rest of the day -- there's no pattern or logic to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it crashes it goes to a blue screen, says it's found a problem and is doing a system dump to protect the computer (I'll try and note the exact words next time it happens.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It reboots to normal mode without a problem (until the next time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's Acer Aspire 5338 using Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your post, this sounds like the transaction for your pre-orders did not fall through. If you pre-ordered a game it takes around 10 days before release to be charged. So when the initial pre-order is placed it does not charge immediately if being
 purchased with a credit card, the order will charge only when the game is approaching release. If an account does not have funds at the time or charging or a card is expired, it will result in the pre-order license being revoked. To fix this, the game must
 be purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again.</p>

    <title>Xbox communication ban appeal &#47; complaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spydeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox communication ban appeal &#47; complaint</h2>
                    <p>I was recently communication banned for two weeks. I'm assuming it was because of a toxic message I sent to another user, which I regret (heat of the moment), however, there is one thing I'm puzzled by. I've looked around for appeal sections, and there seems to be none, and whenever anyone else asks where it is, someone will hush it down and say that the report system is flawless, and that several different teams review the case, and make a decision on whether or not to ban. I was banned instantly. 5 minutes after the message was sent, I got a message for xbox notifying me of enforcement action. I doubt even 1 team reviewed the case before I was banned. Also, a 2 week ban for calling a players game tactics <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>? I think that's a bit of an overreaction.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If anyone from xbox can give me an explanation of this it would be much appreciated. My GT is Spydeh, if you're wondering.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>stop or change desktop slide show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramblingmuskrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            stop or change desktop slide show</h2>
                    same problem that Judith Mitchell has in her question titled "Disable desktop background slide show in Vista" -- slideshow started on its own,
<span style="font-weight: bold">I can't stop or change it.</span><br />
<br />
I followed the answer from&nbsp; Azeez Nadeem - Microsoft Support until I got to "(f) . Set Slide show under Desktop background settings to Paused and then click OK to save the changes."<br />
<br />
but there is <span style="font-weight: bold">no</span> "desktop background settings" listed. The list shows13 items, from advanced settings to battery.&nbsp; can you tell me what I should do?<br />
<br />
(at&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-desktop-background-slide-show there is a video about, logically enough, desktop slide shows. It shows pics with a little checkmark in their upper left.&nbsp; mine don't have that.&nbsp; they have -- as best as
 I recall, because now I can't find "change desktop background" on control panel to see -- a box on their lower right with two blue checks or arrows or something. clicking those boxes doesn't do anything.<br />
why don't I have those upper-left boxes? shouldn't the video address the unchangeable-slide-show issue?)<br />
<br />
thanks for any help<br />

<h2>            Screen freezes after Windows 10 upgrading to 1809</h2>
                    <div>
<div>The screen freezes and clicking the cursor anywhere on the screen is invalid.Sometimes right-clicking the cursor in the taskbar is valid, but I can't click on any item in the list.If this happens while I'm using the browser(all browser), the page content
 won't be affected. Other problems with the browser, such as: clicking on the title bar causes the page to close, clicking on a random favorites page will open all favorites pages.and so on.</div>
<div>After I pressed Ctrl + Alt + Delete to enter the options interface, the computer returned to normal.</div>
<div>This happens randomly when I'm using a computer, and it happened frequently.I reinstalled the system many times and went back to 1803 without solving this problem.</div>
<div>How do I solve it once and for all?</div>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:<br />
<br />
1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.<br />
<br />
2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
3. Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command and press Enter key.<br />
<br />
4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. <br />
<br />
If issue still persists, perform clean boot:<br />

<h2>            system too slow after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    I have tried every troubleshooting option, &nbsp;things work for about an hour than slows down again. Upgraded from 8.1 to 10 on the 29th, had to do a clean install a week later, &nbsp;removed AVS, &nbsp;etc. Still have up to 5 minute lag times just opening Edge. Bing
 never works, etc. How can I revert to 8.1 now that it is over 30 days? I don't have 8.1 media since it was pre installed on laptop

            <p>Hi Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will&nbsp;help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 1.</strong> Run Performance and maintenance troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Go to Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooting, and then click on&nbsp;Troubleshooting.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Under System and Security, click&nbsp;on System Maintenance&nbsp;then run it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For reference, refer to the link to improve computerâ€™s performance:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
â€œWays to improve your PC's performanceâ€</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-pc-performance#section_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-pc-performance#section_1</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note : It is also applicable for windows 10 as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><strong> Clean boot.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. You can refer to this article for
 more information:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> <strong>Run SFC scan&nbsp;Tool.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
First, I would suggest you to run the System File check scan and check if it resolves the issue. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to these steps to perform a SFC
 scan: <br />
&nbsp;1.Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt<br />
&nbsp;2.In the command prompt type the following command: sfc/scannow and press enter<br />
&nbsp;3.Now, restart the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong> <strong>Security scan.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you notice performance related issues or if programs takes time to load, there are chances that some security threats got installed in the computer without your knowledge. To make sure that the issue is not caused due to any security threats like virus or
 malware, I would suggest you to perform a complete security scan. Make sure that the antivirus software is updated with the recent virus signatures before you run a security scan.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can also download and run the Microsoft Security Scanner from here:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://safety.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://safety.live.com</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection. Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting
 the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope this helps.<br />
Let us know the status of the issue so that we can assist you better.</div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello, I did Method 1,3 and 4. No problems showed, no security issues. System still lagging, but only 8-10 seconds most times, but up to a minute. Very frustrating, just typing this it has stalled 3 times. Any game I play has such a lag in the middle that
 it isn't worth playing. Don't have time yet to the clean&nbsp;boot test. I&nbsp;am using&nbsp;Windows defender since it wasn't playing with ESAT NOD at all. Only&nbsp;using Edge, since Chrome was locking up, but have to have Google on my favorites&nbsp;bar &nbsp;since Bing crashes all
 the time. Any more ideas? System seems to start quickly, it is app, programs and page loads that hang up. Restart can take up to 10 minutes, and sometimes just getting the power option to show up takes 5 minutes. Would love to go back to 8.1 until they get
 the bugs worked out on Windows 10.

            <p>Okay, I think I have solved the problem. I searched other threads on this forum, and tried this:</p>
<p>Go to Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Privacy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off all 5 or 6 of the apps they have automatically turned on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejoice at having a fast computer again. Without all that "report to Microsoft, Search for local ads, Ad ID stuff" running in the background, your system will be super fast again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The proof will be if I put it to sleep and it comes back okay, but for now, it is awesome to be able to type this with no stalling every 5 words.</p>

            spoke too soon, back to the same thing again after coming out of sleep. I have shut down and started up, same thing. Really getting frustrated. System takes 5 minutes after logging in to just load everything, clicking on anything gets no response. Then
 it will start going, but stall every load, every couple of words typed.
