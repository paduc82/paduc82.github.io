<h2>            SCRIPT ERROR ON DESK TOP</h2>
                    <p>I have recently started to see a 'script error' message appear on my desk top. I searched the topic and only found errors that affect IE. This error occurs before I launch my browser. There is a URL in the&nbsp;message box (https://ubp-common-uk-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/require/require.js).
 The 'error' doesn't seem to cause any problems and is a pain to have to clear it. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix this!</p>
<p>I am not sure where this came from ‚Äì mine started with the installation of the Amazon assistant and the one-button program as of four days ago (December 28).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I uninstalled Amazon assistant over and over again only to find that it came back after the next reboot. It appears that Amazon assistant is reinstalled by a program called Amazon1buttonservice64.exe and that lives in a folder called Amazon1ButtonApp under
 the programs X 86 folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried to delete this program but it was protected because it always initiates at logon and therefore is ineligible for deletion. Here is the sequence that I used to kill this process:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>first you should go through the standard uninstallation routine for Amazon assistant under the programs app in Control Panel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now download the very valuable suite of applications called sysinternals. This is not malware and it does not try to sell you anything ‚Äì it is a collection of valuable utilities well known to system professionals ‚Äì you need not fear it. &nbsp;You can find it
 here.</p>
<p>http://www.techspot.com/downloads/4680-sysinternals-suite.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will come down as a zip file ‚Äì there are dozens of individual routines that will fix various kinds of problems so you should extract this and keep it in an accessible folder on your hard drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One of the programs is "autoruns64". Open this program then enter "Amazon" into the filter. There will be one or two programs referencing the Amazon assistant and possibly the Amazon1ButtonApp. &nbsp;Click the logon tab and uncheck each one of these. Exit the
 program and reboot the system. This will prevent the system from automatically loading this routine which will reinstall the Amazon assistant (the program that causes the script error).</p>
<p><br />
To be thorough, after your reboot find that folder and program referenced above on your hard drive. You will now be able to delete it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>THIS TO WORKED PERFECTLY FOR ME ‚Äì NO MORE SCRIPT ERRORS!!!<br />
</p>

<h2>            KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR keeps occurring after hibernation&#47;sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hey almost every other time I bring my computer out of hibernation or sleep it blue screens and shows KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR and restarts. I tried a repair install (reinstalling win8.1 but keeping all programs and settings) but that doesn't seem to have
 helped.<br />
<br />
I currently have 2 minidump files from these.</p>

            <p>As you can see, the crash dumps were not very helpful in pinpointing the cause of the crashes. That being said, there are a few things we can do to see if we can stop the system from crashing and this includes, updating drivers and removing drivers that
 are known to cause BSOD's. </p>
<p>

<p>Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt! ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'+8681 )</p>
<p>Followup: MachineOwner</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7a)</strong><br />
The requested page of kernel data could not be read in.&nbsp; Typically caused by<br />
a bad block in the paging file or disk controller error. Also see</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR.</strong><br />
If the error status is 0xC000000E, 0xC000009C, 0xC000009D or 0xC0000185,<br />
it means the disk subsystem has experienced a failure.<br />
If the error status is 0xC000009A, then it means the request failed because<br />
a filesystem failed to make forward progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arguments:<br />
Arg1: fffff6e00066d390, lock type that was held (value 1,2,3, or PTE address)<br />
Arg2: ffffffffc000003f, error status (normally i/o status code)<br />
Arg3: 0000000120a6e820, current process (virtual address for lock type 3, or PTE)<br />

</p><p>Now, if you have <strong>Hotspot shield </strong><strong>(HSS</strong>) installed, please remove it. I would also recommend the removal of AVG, but we should wait and see if removing HSS did the trick.</p>

            <p>So far I've uninstalled AVG and Hotspotshield and renamed the AMD Overdrive .sys file (dunno why that is even there tbh). It has blue screened once more since and I've uploaded that dmp file in a zip to the google drive folder just in case. Later on I'll
 try drive verifier.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably should have included a little backstory on when this started occurring. A few weeks ago I noticed that whenever I come out of hibernation or sleep my wifi wouldn't work until I messed with the driver. I don't know that this is connected though as
 later on while moving files around from my old windows hard drive to a new partition (running a new SSD in the normal place and a HDD in my cdrom slot) and I think I might have gotten confused and deleted some stuff from my SSD's windows by mistake. I caught
 myself but couldn't confirm this. Also I played around with <a href="http://www.thewindowstweaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Tweaker</a>. A few days later if I tried opening an explorer window from the taskbar it would throw an "Invalid Parameter" error. After running sfc I decided to do a system restore. The restore failed initially due to my old win partition being in but
 after removing that temporarily it was able to finish and I could use explorer again as normal. After that it started having the blue screens after hibernating. I've even done a repair install (also failed until I removed my HDD again) in hopes to fix this
 since and the only thing that has helped is fix the wifi issue as far as I've noticed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, I ran 'chkdsk /f' on all my partitions and then turned on Driver Verifier. No matter what drivers I chose it always had a messed up blue screen right after the windows logo at startup and then restart. I tried selecting all drivers, then all non-Microsoft,
 then non-Microsoft and left out the AMD and Synaptic drivers, just the AMD drivers, and then 3 random Microsoft drivers. To be able to boot again I had to use System Restore as 'verifier /reset' resulted in "No changes made". Also on the last one I tried removing
 my HDD to see if that was affecting things but it still showed the weird blue screen. Lastly I've set my SSD to have the only partition for now instead of also having one on the my data partition on the HDD (separate from the old win partition).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the only new file in the Minidump folder is a blue screen that occurred after I did the system restore. This dmp seems to mention the TAP Windows Virtual network driver. Has the same crash address as at least one of the prior ones "ntoskrnl.exe+153ca0".
 I've uploaded that to the google file too and am going to uninstall that driver</p>

            Well I had to restart the pc for it to do them at startup for 2 of my partitions but I'm pretty sure they were good as I've run just regular chkdsk multiple times lately without /f and it show no errors. Also added to the above post. New dmp file that
 is different and occured after I used system restore to come out of the Driver Verifier bootloop.&nbsp;

            <p>Well it occurred again this morning. I put the dpm file in the google folder as "BSOD_dump_10_5_2014.zip". This one mentions this BSOD was caused by address vdrvroot.sys+55150d80. FIle Description is Virtual Drive Root Enumerator. The Crash Address is the
 same one I keep seeing,&nbsp;ntoskrnl.exe+153ca0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking reinstalling the HP drivers like you posted above and see if that helps. They are there but my guess is one might be corrupted on startup or something

<h2>            Windows Hello</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen lot's of entries on how to resolve the "Windows Hello isn't available on this device" error but none has worked for me so far. I am using an HP ProBook 4340s laptop that I have just recently upgraded to Windows 10. Initially, the fingerprint
 scanner used to work just fine until this upgrade. I have:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Updated the drivers through Windows update; and</li><li>Enabled the "Allow use of Biometrics" in Device Manager;</li></ul>
<p>But the reader is still not working. What else could I do to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to learn more about your concern. Help us verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you said upgrade to Windows 10, did you mean the upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10?</li><li>If not, it could mean that you installed the latest update for Windows 10. With that in mind, were you able to use Windows Hello before?</li><li>If so, have you tried to update the drivers from Device Manager? How about rolling back the driver to its previous version?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response John. Much appreciation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Herebelow are my further comments to the points you raise:</p>
<ul>
<li>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7;</li><li>And yes, I run Windows update and thus I presume I have the latest windows updates. While I won't say that I have used Windows Hello before, for I doubt that it was called that (Windows Hello) in Windows 7, I want to confirm that I indeed was using fingerprint
 scanning for login before;</li><li>The option to Roll Back Driver is greyed out (not available) in the Driver's tab of the Validity Sensor Properties dialogue box.</li></ul>
<p>I hope I have been clear with my response. If not, do let me know for further clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<p>Got it. This may have been a hardware limitation. Windows Hello biometrics sign-in requires specialized hardware including a Windows Hello capable device, fingerprint reader, illuminated IR sensor or other biometric sensors. An update to its driver may just
 make your fingerprint reader compatible with Windows Hello. But until then, you might need to get a separate hardware to use Windows Hello.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for the feedback John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, just for clarity: </p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I had fingerprint scanning working before the upgrade, does it mean my hardware is obsolete for Windows 10?
</li><li>Does it also mean that should I roll back to Windows 7, I should be able to use the fingerprint scanner just like I used to before the upgrade?</li></ul>
<p>By the way, even TrueKey is not working anymore... I am not able to activate face recognition!</p>

<p>Your fingerprint reader may still be useful on other software. The reason why you are not able to use it with Windows Hello is more likely a compatibility issue. It was optimize for your previous software and after you upgraded to Windows 10, its driver
 has to be updated as well to work with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolling back to Windows 7 is entirely your decision. While we recommend to use Windows 10 because of its new features and system securities, you're the one who will be using it after all, so it's your call. Check if Creators Update will allow you to go back
 to Windows 7. Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>
&gt; <strong>Recovery</strong>. Most probably, it will display Go back to the previous version of Windows 10 and that will only get you to Anniversary Update. You may need to do a clean installation of Windows 7 using your installation disc or Media Creation Tool
 together with your product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your TrueKey issue, try to update or reinstall the software. If the issue persists, contact the developer to verify if its compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

            That depends on whether your processor supports virtualization. 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager, expand the processor section and please post the exact model of your processor
<br />
<br />On a Dell Virtualization can be turned off in BIOS, so if you are having an issue with virtualization , you might like to check there also . . .

            Depending on which virtualization technology you will be using and depending on your processor, this will give you an indication to whether your machine will be supported:
<br />
<br />it is very easy to see if your machine will support virtualization from the aspect of the processor, by physically searching the type and model (Generation of the processor). You will then have to scroll down and take a look at the following capabilities:
<br />
<br />Intel:registered: Virtualization Technology (VT-x) 
<br />Intel:registered: Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) 
<br />
<br />Both should be yes in the case of an Intel CPU.
<br />
<br />If we you are considering Hyper-V as your Virtualization software then you can check out the following minimum requirements: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a lot of different Virtulization software out there and i do recommend virtualbox or VMware as alternatives to Hyper-V.
<br />
<br />If you do have any other questions, please do feel free to ask, Hope this helps, Good Luck

            Hi RMTS97, yes that processor does support Virtualization
<br />
<br />Intel:registered: Virtualization Technology (VT-x)  - Yes

<p><strong>Creating a bootable copy of Windows 7 on thumb drive:</strong></p>
<p>you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that‚Äôs at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 Image is stored, open
 it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the Begin copying button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs it, the next step now is to boot your computer from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your computer
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment</p>

<p>Why not use the Acer recovery disks you were prompted to make when you first got your Acer?</p>
<p>Or even the use the hidden recovery partition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use either of the above methods the Key will not be required and the PC will be put back to factory condition.</p>
<p>If you use the ISO download, you will need to use the Key, any software that was preinstalled by Acer will not be included,&nbsp;any built in webcam will not function, any drivers will only be generic drivers&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox screen static&#47; fuzz&#47; flicker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deth maker666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox screen static&#47; fuzz&#47; flicker</h2>
                    
<p>The Xbox will turn on normally, and will operate properly (I can use it to play games and everything else) but the screen will go to a blank static/ fuzz. Then return to normal but it repeats this every 5 seconds. This issue is not effected whether or not
 Kinect is plugged in. This issue did not start until after the July 2014 update. It happened right after the update I unplugged Kinect and restarted the system with out it and it was fine, I plugged it back in and was fine. The problem did come back until
 after the console was restarted, It is now and intermittent problem but when it happens the console unusable due to the screen cutting out every 5 seconds for 1 second. Changing the HDMI cables didn't change this, I use the one included in the box and its
 not bent or kinked. The TV doesn't appear to be the issue changing the source and using different cables again change nothing.</p>
<p>So right now Its working fine; Ive had something similar in January (bought the console day 1) but their was not screen output just a black screen. To me it seems like the HDMI out put is the issue. I would just like to know if anyone else has this issue&nbsp;
 I just want to know the proper terminology for the issue and if anyone has had to send theirs away.

<p>Yes I have been having this problem for about a month now, i have the extra year protection I was thinking of taking my unit back it is very annoying. &nbsp;I turn the system on &nbsp;and the screen turns to a white snowy static for one second and back except it happens
 faster than every 5 seconds its like every 2 seconds. &nbsp;Turning the system off doesn't change it I have to unplug it. &nbsp;For the first time today I noticed that same High definition type snowy static starting to creep in behind a Netflix movie I was watching
 it went away after about 3 minutes. &nbsp;This started to scare me as if the problem was getting worse. &nbsp;The start up problem happens about once a day.</p>

<p>Same issue here. Has only been happening recently so the update seems like it was probably what caused it. A hard reset temporarily resolves the problem before eventually coming back. Mostly just a minor inconvenience but it would be nice to see this fixed
 soon.</p>

<h2>            How to remove Daemon Tools Pro after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I updated windows 10 I have been having some issues with Daemon Tools Pro since it's not compatible with windows 10 anymore, there is no way I could uninstall it or either delete its folder because of the remaining "DTShl64.dll". I have tried using
 the CMD to remove it and it hasn't worked, I've tried some other tutorials to delete that DLL and it is still not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to know if someone has found a solution for that, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Provide the DirectX Diagnostics result</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Running<em>dxdiag</em> will provide a complete set of system specifications.

 on Start; in the start search type ‚Äòdxdiag‚Äô (without quotes) and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Copy
 and paste the information under System tab and Display tab while posting back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Update your graphics drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start<span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type devmgmt.msc in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 Device Manager, expand display adapter and click update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you‚Äôve graphics issues while playing the game.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I bought a new monitor today that has an optimal display (as prompted by Windows) of 1920x1080</p>
<p>However, on this resolution, the left hand side of my windows/taskbar is missing and when I attempted to alter the resolution, I got black borders around my windows?</p>
<p>I'M SO CONFUSED!!!</p>
<p>I've tried opening my graphics settings and changing the resolution/aspect ratio to no avail and have searched every forum on the internet for an answer, but nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>I've attached an image displaying a Google tab (note that the back arrow is missing and a bit of the tab icon has been chopped off) and showing how my Windows key is missing from my taskbar (as it has also been chopped off).</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!</p>

            Hi Libby,
<br />
<br />This sounds a hardware related issue. What is the make and model of the monitor you are using? You need to check the auto-adjust button on the monitor which will attempt to realign the image with the monitor. Check the side buttons on the monitor to find them.

<h2>            Unable to download Win7 ISO from MSFT Site</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to download a Windows 7 64-bit pro ISO from the Microsoft store.&nbsp; I recently received a new laptop from my employer and they gave me a CD for it, however the new laptop has no optical drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue with some software on my laptop and need to do a fresh install of Win7.&nbsp; We have a bulk license for it at work and it only has about 160 of the 500 installations used, but for some reason the consumer-facing Microsoft site will not allow me
 to download the ISO since it's a business license.</p>
<p><br />
How do I go about getting the ISO downloaded and installed on a USB drive so I can reinstall Windows?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8, VLC Player and MKV Files&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I upgraded to Windows 8 64bit last week and updated my Shark007 codec packs to the latest Windows 8 versions but seem to have an issue with MKV files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some reason I cannot select VLC player to be the default player for MKV files, only WMP or WMC.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I right click on a file it does give me the option to play using VLC and it plays fine but when I try to associate MKV files with VLC through the control panel or properties it just wont take.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Newly Downloaded Windows 10 Pro, Now Says PC Won&#39;t Activate</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased brand new HP PC.&nbsp; It came with windows 10 home.&nbsp; I was wanting to connect to it via Remote Desktop, but was informed Home version does not have it, and would I like to shell out $99 to upgrade to windows 10 Pro. I decide to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide payment information and PC (via MS Store) and immediately sofware downloaded and installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon completion, however, now getting error:&nbsp; Windows report that no product key was found on our device.&nbsp; Error code:&nbsp; 0xC004F213</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could just scream!&nbsp; Had a working version of Win 10 Home, paid $99 and apparently, lost BOTH licenses.&nbsp; Went in circles on the MS site/virtual agent, calling in (and it took long enough that they closed shop).&nbsp; So Bummed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I contact my credit card company and cancel payment, thought I would try here for ideas?</p>

            Hi Pat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter in the same location and report back its findings
<br />
<br />I know it seemed like it installed something but all it does during Easy Upgrade is apply a Pro Digital License and then unlocks the few extra features for Pro hidden in Home version - otherwise it's the exact same OS with nothing reinstalled.  
<br />
<br />What's likely happened and is happening more often lately is that the server didn't pick up the Digital License the Store applies first.  This is because they can't build servers fast enough to keep up with activations as Windows 10 approaches one billion Users (equal to the population of three United States).  
<br />
<br />So you can go back to the Store app, in Settings (three dots at top right) choose My Library or Purchased to find the Pro Upgrade, install it again to reapply the DL and see if it sticks this time.  
<br />
<br />If not and you don't want to wait you can contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks for replying. I had run the troubleshooter and when it completed it mentioned that it could not activate my copy of windows. Suggest I contact my system administrator who would be myself LOL. I will go ahead and try and see if I can reinstall from
 the store. I will let you know what happens. Thank you for your help.

            Hi Pat
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise?
<br />
<br />If that is Enterprise, that is caused by a known bug in the Home to Pro upgrade and you need to contact Microsoft Support to have them resolve this, they know about this bug and will fix this in 2 minutes . . .

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The attached DMP file is of the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (116)</span></strong> bug check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><em>This indicates that an attempt to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<em><strong>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</strong></em>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN
 article!</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Timeout detection:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<em>Dxgkrnl.sys</em>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries
 to preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds.
 If the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</em><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Preparation for recovery:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</strong></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware.
 The operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Desktop recovery:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<em>Dxgkrnl.sys</em>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented
 with the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)
</strong></em><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as vRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<strong>GPU testing:</strong> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAM testing:</strong> Memtest (RUN FOR NO LESS THAN ~8 PASSES) - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Memtest:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<strong>Download Memtest86+ here:</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Corrupt hard drive or Windows install / OS install resulting in corruption to the registry or page file.<br />
<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<strong>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>a )</strong> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<strong>b )</strong> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<strong>c )</strong> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<strong>d ) </strong>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<strong>b ).</strong> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<strong>e )</strong> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<strong>Run System File Checker:</strong><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure- Heat, power issue (PSU issue), faulty vRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
„Éª&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t complete update and stalls</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently with the automatic Windows 10 updates, the process seems to be complete, but once the computer restarts it returns to a black screen with a dial that never ends. At this point I have to force shut down the computer and once y reboot it forces to
 go the restoration point. It seems that after it install the updates the OS becomes unstable and it fails. In couple of opportunities I allowed the computer to run to see if it was just a matter of time before the issue would resolve itself, but unfortunately
 the computer reins in that state for hours, 8 hours + before forced reboot. I need assistance!</p>
