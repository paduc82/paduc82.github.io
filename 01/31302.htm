<p>You should understand that if yo do not set the correct xbox live parental settings that this may occur. I would recommened not letting you child use a Xbox live Headset so these people would no know that they are a young child. Put your settings so only
 friends can send you messages and that he can only hear people that are on his friends list. You should understand that there are weirdo's in this world and they are wherever you go. Even on games consoles.</p>

<p>That's good you are on top of it. &nbsp;Unfortunately you never know who is on Xbox, and like this showed, it can take some time before a person's true intentions become known. &nbsp;Have you also blocked communications and muted him? &nbsp;If not, be sure you do. &nbsp;This
 will stand in effect until you unmute him, so even if you change games. &nbsp;And the only way to unblock communications is if YOU send him a message. &nbsp;So block communications and then make sure you and no one in your family messages him. &nbsp;My son only has friends
 he knows in school, and the sons of dads I know on his friends list. &nbsp;From there he branches out here and there, but I have it set up to where I have to approve the friends he puts on his list. &nbsp;Best of luck with everything. &nbsp;There are all kinds on Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">To be perfectly honest this statement above makes it entirely your fault that this has happened. If your child(ren) are minors, which they are, then you should be actively monitoring their interactions on XBL. The Terms of Service
 tell you this. Parental Settings on a child account can be adjusted to require an adult approval of any friend request to the child account.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The above posters are correct in that you can not name and shame another player here, regardless of what they may or may not have done and regardless of your feelings on the matter. What you need to do is
<strong>file a complaint, mute, block communications and remove the offender from his friend list.</strong> And if you feel the offender will take action on his talk you should involve your local police department.

<p>&nbsp;No &nbsp;name and shames. and if he said he would hack you then that most likely means that he has no way of hacking you. why would a person with whom you know his gamertag hack you, doesn't make sense. a hacker will hack your account, but he will never tell
 you he is going to hack the account. Think about it. block the perv, report him and move on with your life. you've done all you can, calling someone out is wrong and against the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>so you say "no name and shames"! what if i say nothing and he does something to a child through XBL? &nbsp;i guess that would make it ok then since you say i should follow the rules? put his name out their and let the public know what he was trying &nbsp;to do!! you
 all defend the perv while I'm just trying to defend my kids!! </p>
<p>it has been brought to XBL attention!!! If XBL does nothing its on them!!!!</p>

            <div>Hi Tom,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Restart your computer and boot into safe mode and&nbsp;reduce display settings. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Safe mode starts
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> with a limited set of files and drivers.
 Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to this article to boot to safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">A
 description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</a></span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to reduce the display settings:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.<br />
b. Double-click Display.<br />
c. Click the Settings tab, and then note the settings for Colors and Screen area.<br />
d. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click High Color (16 bit).<br />
e. Move the Screen area or Desktop area slider to 800 by 600 pixels, and then click OK.<br />
f. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>This should help you fix the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Webcam installation problem- code 39</h2>
                    My GT Max webcam, with no additional software CD, won't install properly. Only the video part won't work, and it's connected via USB.
<div>It says the problem is the "driver is corrupted or missing," with code 39. I have tried reinstalling the device, reinstalling my computer, updating my computer, and checking for software updates for the device several times. Nothing has changed at all.</div>
<div>What should I do next?</div>

<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run the hardware troubleshooter and check what the issue is and fix it accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the link given below open hardware troubleshooter.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As the webcam did not come with any driver application or software, Windows will try to load the generic drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows is not able to load the drivers, then I would suggest you to contact the vendor or the manufacturer to obtain drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            When i turn on my PC it can&#39;t be automatically connected to internet.</h2>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>When i turn on my PC it can't be automatically connected to internet.In network and sharing center i have two networks:home and unidentified public network.When i try to go to some web pages the connection cannot be established.I try to delete that public
 network but with no results.It cannot be deleted or i don't know where to go to delete it.<br />
I solve this problem by disabling my network adapter and enabling it again.Then there is only my home network appears in Network and sharing center and internet connection is established with no problems.<br />
I have Huawei HG520i adsl&nbsp; router and have no problem with it on Win XP.<br />
How can i solve this without disabling and enabling my router.This is very boring.

            <em><strong>VERY URGENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PROBLEM IS SOLVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>
<br />
</em><br />
Hi Cody<br />
<br />
I am very happy to say that i solved the problem.IT DO NOT RETURNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
To everyone with this problem,especially to <strong>GeordieGuy</strong> ,do following:<br />
As Cody suggested i restarted my computer and booted into Safe mode with NETWORKING!!!!! In ordinary Safe mode my network adapter is not working and you cannot do anything.But in Safe mode with networking my PC connected to network with only one network-Home
 network,without any unidentified public network.Then i restarted my PC normally and try clean boot and solve problem like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
After restarting,PC connected to network without any problem.Then i tried to find witch service is making problems.I was lucky,there was only 9 services and i tried with the first one by enabling it.This service was<br />
<br />
SERVICE<br />
##Id_String1.6844F930_1628_4223_B5CC_5BB94B879762##<br />
<br />
MANUFACTURER<br />
Apple Computer,Inc.<br />
<br />
I enabled it,then restarted PC and the problem was back.Then i disabled it again and restarted PC.After that everything was OK again.I had only one Home network with full internet access with no need to enable or disable my network adapter.Then i activated
<em><strong>all other</strong> </em>(all but ##Id_String1.6844F930_1628_4223_B5CC_5BB94B879762##)Microsoft services and restarted PC again.It works excellent.Problem is GONE.I also check the Load Startup Items check box and again restarted PC and everything
 is OK.I even shuted it down several times nad on return everything were OK.<br />
<br />
So Cody,after finding solution for my problem,what do you think about this service?Where does it came from?Is it a part of Win7 or something else is involved?I would like to know something about it.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />

            Hi Claudia, yes you will be able to play HEVC video on that system . .. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 built In Films and TV App supports HEVC Playback natively
<br />
<br />And if you have any trouble playing the GoPro Videos, you can install the VLC Player into Windows 10 - it is totally Free and full featured . ..

<p>Thank you for the answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the go pro site says "HEVC is supported by computers running Windows 10 that mount Intel Kaby Lake (or equivalent) and later.";&nbsp; However my model is older (2014) and should be part of the haswell architecture (if I'm not mistaken).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is 100% sure that hevc is supported?</p>

            Hi Claudia
<br />
<br />The processor on your PC does not matter with regards to playing HEVC video, you have a NVIDIA GeForce 820M  and the video will play through that, you are not reliant on Intel HD Graphics on your system . . .

    <title>Windows 8 taskbar can become visible even in fullscreen extend display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mangusbrother  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 taskbar can become visible even in fullscreen extend display</h2>
                    I had an Extended display<br />
The second screen is set to play a full screen video<br />
The taskbar is correctly hidden at this stage, behind the video<br />
Then on the primary screen i click on the taskbar there. The taskbar becomes visible on both screens.<br />
To remove the taskbar from the second screen i have to click (in this case pause/play the vide) on the second screen.<br />
I believe this is some sort of bug.

            Hi man,<br />
First off, I would like to know if the issue is confined to the video player:<br />
Search for 'taskbar' without the quotes on the start screen and select 'Taskbar' from settings.<br />
There, check 'Auto- hide the taskbar'.<br />
Move the mouse to the taskbar on the primary screen and check if it appears on the secondary.<br />
Also, if the issue is with only the video player and you are experiencing trouble because of it, try another player.<br />
If the same happens with auto-hide, it either might be a functionality or a bug.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a system file checker scan.</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate your Windows XP installation CD.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to Start, then to Run, and type in "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes - and with a space between the SFC.EXE and the /SCANNOW). The press Enter.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The program may (or it may not) ask you for your Windows XP installation CD - please insert it at the prompt. If it doesn't ask you for the CD this means that it wasn't necessary to replace any files.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the event the system asks you for the CD, you must visit Windows Update immediately after the scan is completed (Please note that there won't be any confirmation dialog - the program will just exit
 without telling you anything). </p>

<h2>            Mouse buttons 4 and 5 not working in games after the Creators update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just upgraded to the Creators update and in games my Logitech g502's extra mouse buttons aren't getting picked up ( buttons 4 and 5). For example, I go to an action currently bound to button 4, click to change it and when I press mouse button 5 it just
 doesn't know its been pressed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked around and people are seeing it in LoL, Dishonored 2, Witcher 3 and a few other games. I suspect the update is still rolling out and people haven't picked up on it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried hardware troubleshooter, unplugging and plugging it back in again, updated NVidia drivers... no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the links mentioned in this reddit thread:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/66ng8i/cant_use_special_mouse_keys_in_witcher_3_goty/</p>
<p>but don't really want to bind to key presses ( suggested in one of the other links ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might just rollback the creators update and see what happens!</p>

            <p>I think its previw build 10240. Because I am not upgraded through windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version 347.88 is doing well without compatibility mode. I am just curious why the latest nvidia driver is not working in windows 10. Also when I turning on my PC Windows update always automatically downloading and installing latest driver without my
 permission and its destroying my older working driver 347.88.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trying to connect a Yamaha keyboard to my computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to connect a Yamaha keyboard to my computer</h2>
                    I'm trying to connect my Yamaha YPG235 keyboard to my computer using USB drive cable. I have Windows 7 OS, and when I attempt to install the driver for this device, it tells me that there is no driver for this OS. The installation disk lists Windows 2000,
 windows vista and windows xp as possible Operating systems, but does not list Windows 7. I think I bought the keyboard before windows 7 came out. Does anybody know of a link or a solution to this so I can get my keyboard going? Thanks.

            Hard to believe that there would be no driver out there for Windows 7. I cannot be the only person who has this issue. I am checking with Yamaha customer service as well. Thanks, though.

</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. Do you get any errors when you try and chat? Try uninstall and reinstalling your game. Also try powering down your phone completely leave off for a minute or so before turning back on.</p>

<p>Hey Luca</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing that bit of info for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would recommend is that you adjust your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4482922/xbox-one-online-safety-and-privacy-settings-for-parents-and-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Privacy</a> settings accordingly in order for you to be able to communicate with others in-game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adjusting these settings to the appropriate settings will also alleviate any other problems you might have, such as with making purchases, or joining others games.<br />
</p>
<p>This can be done by following these simple steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to Xbox.com and&nbsp;sign in to your account (this must be an adult account).
</span></li><li><span>Select your gamertag.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Xbox settings</strong>. If you don't see this option, select
<strong>More links</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;and then select <strong>Xbox settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Privacy &amp; online safety</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select either the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Safety</strong>&nbsp;tab or the&nbsp;<strong>Privacy
</strong>tab. Review the current settings and update any that you want to change.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Save</strong> before leaving or switching to another tab. If you don't save the changes before you move to the other tab, your changes won't be saved.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Give this a try and let us know if this works out for you!</span></p>

            <p>SYSTEM RESTORE was the workaround this problem...but it is not a solution for those who never had their Epson Stylus Pro 3800 Driver v6.5 and printer operating smoothly on Windows 10. My solution: SYSTEM RESTORE back to January 16, 2015: a date I knew that
 my Epson 3800 was working well with the Windows 10 OS. Mamma Mia! PRAISE BE to SYSTEM RESTORE!!! I am back in the photo printing business!!! However, I did spend, and waste, two full days trying to do the uninstall/reinstall of the Epson Sylus Pro 3800 Driver
 v 6.5 on my Windows 10 OS. I suspect that the install failure may be caused by a corruption during the uninstall process, and this interferes with the printer / USB port recognition; and thus the driver cannot fully download. WHAT I learned is that saving
 SYSTEM RESTORE points when "life is good" is mandatory and a life saver; and, "don't fix what ain't broken".....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all the rest of you...</p>

<p>The reason they didn't add it was because it was the least successful out of the three games, the added the two that made the most sales and were loved by the players. I doubt they would add a DLC for Budokai 2.</p>

<p>This is normally the case, when your CPU or GPU gets hot, the fan turns on until it reaches a certain temperature and then switches off. What might be worth a look is to see if there is a BIOS update available for your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest BIOS update is A14, when you boot your system, on the Dell screen, just above the progress bar, note the BIOS version you are running, if it is not A14 -

<h2>            Updates for windows xp home edition version 2002 available or not&#63;</h2>
                    My windows xp home edition version 2002 do not get updated? Microsoft site does not connect? Actually I purchased an Acer notebook and along with it got windows recovery CDs. Now when there was some problem with the windows, I used the same CDs and recovered
 the windows, but when I connect it to the internet and try to update the windows, the microsoft website just does not connect.&nbsp;

<div>I want to know:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whether Service Pack 1 system is updated or not?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If updated, how?&nbsp;</div>

            You can use another computer if necessary to download the latest service packs.&nbsp; Generally you only need to load the last service pack, but in the case of XP, you must have at least service pack 1A installed before you can install Service Pack 3.&nbsp; The
 following KB article gives links to where you can download any of the service packs.&nbsp; Download them on another computer if you can't connect with your computer and move / install them using a USB drive or burn them to a CD...<br />
