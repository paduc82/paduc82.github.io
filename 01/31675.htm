    <title>Inactive Window Scrolling is too fast - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inactive Window Scrolling is too fast</h2>
                    <p>I have my mouse scrolling settings where I need them for normal scrolling; it seems a bit redundant to me but there were three places where they would ask me how fast I want my mouse to scroll:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Setting Application --&gt; Mouse and Touchpad Settings</p>
<p>Control Panel --&gt; Mouse --&gt; Scrolling</p>
<p>ELAN --&gt; Two-Finger Gestures --&gt; Scrolling</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrolling normally works great; no problems here. The problem comes when I have an inactive window that I am trying to scroll through. It then scrolls way too fast and I cannot get to the right part of the page because I have to constantly fidget back and
 forth, trial and error, until it gets to the right place. And that is really frustrating! How do I change this setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhat related, but not as much of a problem:</p>
<p>I am using a touchscreen, so I can scroll through pages with my finger on the screen as well sometimes. Again, works great in most instances, but on Google Spreadsheets, the touch scroll is much too fast, at a similar pace as the problem mentioned above.
 That wasn't as big of a problem because scrolling on a 15" screen is easier than scrolling on a 4" touchpad, but nonetheless it is irritating that all scrolls are not consistent in speed.<br />

            <p>I'm on a Lenovo Edge 15 with Intel Core i7 running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are up to date. I checked before posting this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be a settings issue. If there isn't a way to change your settings for this feature, then Microsoft should either make one or change the default setting to a slower speed that is more user-friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you, in previous versions of Windows, I never had to configure a setting for inactive window scrolling. Inactive window scrolling was enabled by default and I never saw a setting to turn it off. Furthermore the scroll was at a decent speed. But now
 it's not. I don't think it's limited to my computer either, although I haven't verified that the issue exists on any other computer yet, except for the Google Sheets issue.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth on Windows 10 detecting Xbox Controller as &#39;input&#39; not &#39;xbox one controller&#39; and will not connect</h2>
                    Recently, I bought an xbox one s controller. It used to connect fine to my computer, but now it no longer does. It connects to all other computers and shows up as 'Xbox one controller'. Is there a driver I should download to help? I have done every troubleshooting
 option on this website. Thank you

<p>Hey there Dylan! </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your controller is not being detected, Go ahead and try and forget the Bluetooth device on the windows computer and then attempting to re-connect.
</p>
<p>To unpair a device, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Bluetooth icon in the notification area and choose the command Show Bluetooth Devices.</li><li>Right-click a device in the window.</li><li>Choose the command Remove or Remove Device.</li><li>Click the Yes button in the Remove Device dialog box.</li><li>If prompted, type the administrator's password or click the Continue button.</li></ol>
<p>I'm sure you are able to connect the controller but incase you do need some guidance just follow this

            I have done this before. It will not re-connect. the bluetooth does not recognize that I am connecting to an xbox controller. I removed the 'controller' driver from printers &amp; drivers, and attempted to connect by adding the driver back, but even that does
 not work.

<p>Hey Dylan thanks for keeping in touch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend, if it hasn't already been done, to connect the controller (hardwired) to the pc and power cycle the whole thing to make sure everything is communicating properly. Also try
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Updating the controller on the Pc</a> (hardwired). Give it a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other matter!&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have this exact same issue. I have a new custom build Windows 10 Pro PC completed in late October 2018.
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Short answer to the resolution of this problem to save valuable time:</span>
<br />
<strong>Go buy the wireless adapter for the PC.&nbsp; </strong><br />
This issue,&nbsp; if I was paid my normal hourly income would have cost me a $825 loss in income @ my average hourly rate of $75 per hour.&nbsp; Cost of the wireless adapter after taxes $27.49.&nbsp; That's roughly an $800 savings in my specific scenario. (rounding numbers
 of course)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Long answer to arrive at the solution above:</span>&nbsp; I bought a wireless xbox one x controller for my PC November 22nd from MS store online, was delivered November 26th.&nbsp; I easily connected it with zero issue and it
 worked well for 2 days.&nbsp; Then on the 28th a couple updates to my computer occurred and the controller no longer operated on my computer as intended.&nbsp; The naming convention changed from "xbox wireless controller" to "input" with the same game controller icon
 and my computer would not connect to "input" at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I ran through all the troubleshooting for a couple hours cumulatively between speaking with my clients at work and exhausted all searches for this issue as well as any of my known methods. Including attempting system restore, updating bluetooth drives, running
 system troubleshooting options and researching the issue online to see if others had or have this same issue and so forth.<br />
<br />
After the above mentioned, I thought since it was a windows update that broke my new xbox controllers bluetooth link that I would have MS tech support try to work out the issue remotely as I knew it was a windows software conflict/issue and not the controller.&nbsp;
 I can say that I know this to be fact with great confidence because my cell phone, my tablets and my laptop all found the controller via bluetooth as "xbox wireless controller" while at the same moment my PC was still finding the device as "input".<br />
To go ridiculous steps further I turned on my Garmin device to see what it would find and it also found the controller as "xbox wireless controller".&nbsp; I then tested the controller on my laptop and it worked flawlessly on that machine.&nbsp; Conclusion: it is/was
 not a controller malfunction.</p>
<p>Microsoft tech support kept looping me to Xbox support to troubleshoot the controller.&nbsp; I don't think that was a very good resource of man hours or my own personal time since I have already definitively&nbsp; narrowed the issue down to the Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>Finally someone from Microsoft thought it would be smart to transfer me to windows tech support.&nbsp; I asked them to portal into my computer to just do what what was necessary instead of text chatting with me endlessly following commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had mentioned on more than one occasion that I learned the hard way that in Windows 10 enabling restore points was an option and my machine didn't have that turned on, so I was unable to use that method.&nbsp; This is the 1st computer i had ever built and Windows
 10 software is still relatively newer to me, it keeps changing discreetly here and there.&nbsp; I never thought restore points were something to enable as they were all automatic in all of my previous computers and versions of the OS.<br />
The tech support guy, 1st thing he did anyhow was to initiate a system restore.&nbsp; I told him that if he did the system restore that it would only restore to the point after the time the bluetooth connectivity occurred also tried to give the vivid analogy of
 having a severe case of VD then using a restore point to a time where we already have this VD to time travel back so we can re-live those days again for more excruciating days of the disease.&nbsp; I thought living more days with this needlessly was stupid rather
 than working through the issue to treat the problem without further enduring more torment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I was ignored and a system restore was foolishly performed to a point where we were still broken (Yay! That&nbsp; was so very awesome).<br />
Anyhow, long story short and several tech support people later (some were really cool, not all were arrogant) no one could resolve this issue hence my short easy solution above.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
in conclusion, yes I am writing out of frustration because this isn't the 1st time in the past 20 years that tech support has run me through the wringer on methods or fixes that I could do myself being completely uneducated in the computing field.<br />
For the purpose of this story... I did not lose $800 in personal income as I was working on my 2nd computer screen watching for tech support on the other.
<br />
Had I been focused on just this issue then yes 11 hours of my life would have been lost that I would never get back.&nbsp; I'm not sure why MS would pay employees time working on troubleshooting a controller when the customer says it's not the controller and these
 are the 1 through 20 reasons why the customer would know that.&nbsp; I think a few moments more listening to steps already taken or at least asking if any have been made and less time spinning wheels would be more efficient in time spent.&nbsp; It may even make the
 company more profit via less paid hours spent on virtually wasting time or perhaps pass those savings on to the consumers.&nbsp; Just my two cents as I have had several employees working for me in the past..</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Malfunction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asyrios  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>So last weeks i have a problem with a controller , pretty much the RB button doesnt respond sometimes, some other times it does</p>
<p>At first i thought it was likely an issue about heavy usage, that i just broke the pad and should buy a new one ,but recently i realised that after i change the batteries this problem stops. I have 4 rechargable batteries that i rotate like when two of those
 run out i charge them and put the other set of 2, thing is , it seem so that when i use a specific set of batteries this problem comes up, when i change them, everything works fine , and then when i change back to the previous set , then again i have this
 issue . Tried it with a second controller and had the exact same results. So i was wondering, can rly a "bad" set of batteries affect the pad performance in that way?or is it just something random rly that could have happen. its not like that the RB button
 doesnt respond at all but i may need to press it like 5-6 times sometimes to get it to work, but that just with the "bad" set of betteries, to my experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS i use the pad on both xbox one and pc through wireless adaptor, and the problem is the same on both devices.</p>

Couple of questions.. If you use a different controller, does the issue disappear or is it happening with another controller?</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for your response</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem appears in game, yes , thats where i found out about it. Havent tried the windows gamepad settings though to see if all buttons work correctly there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent experienced it on Xbox One S myself, but my brother did while playing FIFA 19 he had the same problem with RB, but i can check with dashboard and edge there too and come back with some more feedback on that</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above the console is an Xbox One S, but yea the problem i experience is while playing on PC using a microsoft wireless adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>The batteries are Sony Cycle Energy Rechargable batteries 2000mah each, idk if this info matters though, they are sold in set of 2s, i have four of them, charging one set while using the other .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that u mention it when the problem first started to appear, it also affected the LS too of my pad, character kept walking in game, or in game chat kept scrolling up, and also the RB button as well had the problems there, later on when i switched to the
 other pad (basically while thinking that my previous pad is propably broken) , at first everything seemed fine ( maybe i was using the "good" batteries at that time) but after couple days the RB started to malfunction again , but not the LS never till this
 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant say is a major problem because really right now, and after i came to that thought that the issue may be caused from the batteries, i only use the "good" set one and i dont have any problems with that.But yea i dont know if its something random really,
 its just a thought of mine.</p>
<p>Those batteries are old too, and the pads are being use by me and my brothers ,so yea thats alot of usage for the pads and also alot of recharge cycles for the same batteries.</p>

<p>Run the controller button tester from Settings&gt;Kinect +Devices&gt;Devices +accessories</p>
<p>Its the "potion jar" icon. Test each button to see if it responds to input.</p>
<p>If it doesn't, you may have to replace controller.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes it worked perfect on Windows 7 until I had my hard drive replaced, now I can't get it to work and drivers are not available or is it built into Windows 7 as HP has advised.</p>

<p>Ever since version 1709 of windows 10, we started to have random bugchecks, on all machines, sometimes 1 or 2 a week, other times 5-6 a week.</p>
<p>I've tried taking a peek at the memory.dmp file using WinDbg, but either couldn't see the error (some problematic driver mentioned), or it isn't in the dump at all.</p>
<p>I also have some AMD ryzen machines, and they don't exhibit this issue.</p>

            Hi Costin, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Try uninstalling Virtual Clone Drive which seems to be the common denominator between the two machines.
<br />
<br />Also, disable the Driver Verifier if it is enabled:
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type verifier.exe in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; Delete existing settings &gt; Finish
<br />
<br />The drivers from Virtual Clone Drive appear to be from 2013 so you could also try updating Virtual Clone Drive if one is available.

            The error is consistent:
<br />
<br />Fault bucket AV_nt!CcWriteBehindInternal
<br />
<br />Can you try updating to KB4284848 (OS Build 17134.137) :
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4284848/windows-10-update-kb4284848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/428484...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, if all affected computers have a Samsung NVMe SSD as the boot drive try installing the Samsung NVMe driver as perhaps the Windows built-in NVMe driver is having an issue with these drives.

<h2>            Windows Security Dialog Box freezes right after coming up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have multiple computers at work that started freezing on the security prompt. Whenever a website requires authentication, the login box pops up and is immediately not responding. The only thing that was recently changed was upgrading office from 2010
 to 2016. I have since tried to remove office completely, but the problem seems to stay. I have also tried rebuilding people's outlook profiles, but doesn't seem to help. Please help if anybody has any ideas. Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Aidas,<br />
<br />
Looks like you are experiencing an issue with your browser. To further isolate the case, we recommend that you install other browsers or update the current browser you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also perform the additional method below and see if the issue persists: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method: Reset Internet Explorer settings</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close&nbsp;all&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Explorer windows. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Tools&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>button, and then select<strong>&nbsp;Internet options</strong>.</li><li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced&nbsp;</strong>tab, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer Settings&nbsp;</strong>dialog box, select&nbsp;<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>When Internet&nbsp;Explorer finishes applying default settings, select&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Restart your PC to apply changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental
 control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Also re-enable the add-ons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the suggestions above didn't work, feel free to post back so we can further troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Aidas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's been a while but did you ever find a solution to this issue. &nbsp;I'm having the same issue after upgrading to Office 2016 (365 ed.). Any Windows Security dialog box that pops up it immediately hangs up. &nbsp;I can't even create the user's Outlook profile
 because it prompts for credentials through the Windows Security dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

I then added office 365 home &amp; business to the 8.1 system but when I try to download the office softwares (excel, word, ect) it states they don't work on this system.<br />
There are other differences I noticed. The computer name is the email address I signed into windows with, and I can't change it.<br />
<br />
I created a new user with a difference name to get around this problem.<br />
<br />
What other Differences between window 8 and windows 8.1<br />
<br />
and when won't office 365 excel, word ect work on windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I want to upgrade my window 8 to windows 8.1.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have upgraded several desktops and laptops from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, and have not encountered any issues with printers or anything else.&nbsp; Everything just works, and in some cases 8.1 is more responsive than 8 was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try looking up your specific HP printer at the Windows Compatibility Center, to see if there is any specific information on your printer for Windows 8.1.&nbsp; You also might want to check with HP about&nbsp;your specific printer model, to see if their software has
 some issue with Windows 8 or 8.1.</p>

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for approaching Microsoft Community for assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>I understand that you are facing an issue with the small square transparent box on the top left corner of Desktop. I would definitely help you in fixing this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>1) Did the issue started recently?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> If you have enabled the aero feature
</span><span>transparency</span><span><span> in windows 7 then the design is by default. Suggest you to click on this link to view Windows Aero features.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-Aero-desktop-experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-Aero-desktop-experience</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can try changing the transparency </span></span><span><span><span>on your computer</span></span></span><span><span> by adjusting the
<strong>Color intensity</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button and then click
<span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span> </span></span></span><span>In the search box, type <span>
<strong>color scheme</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Change the color scheme</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <span><strong>Enable or disable transparent glass on windows</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span> </span></span></span><span>You can adjust the <strong>
Color intensity</strong>from minimum to maximum.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span>If you uncheck the box
<strong>Enable Transparency</strong>the transparency view will be disabled.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persists, I would suggest you to follow the steps to provide the screenshot inorder to narrow down the issue and assist you further.

<br />
Yes, you can do defrag in safe mode :<br />
Start &gt; Computer &gt; right click &gt; Prpoerties &gt; Tools tab &gt; Defragment Now<br />
<br />
1. However, the original idea of doing defrag in safe mode is less services running in safe mode and therefore more efficient in doing defrag.<br />
Such is no longer a neccessity. <br />
2. <strong>I wouldn't manually run defrag</strong>. It takes ages, and I do mean ages. &nbsp;<strong>Scheduled Defrag</strong> is the way to go. It will run silently in the background and it won't interrupt your daily computer chores.<br />
<br />
On a similar topis, why not have a look at &nbsp;<strong>Auslogics </strong>disk defrag software. It is a free program. It is fast. It shows you the progress on the screen. It gives you a summarized report afterwards. And of course, it lets you decide which disk
 you want to defrag.<br />

    <title>Kickstand issue on air planes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilearningu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kickstand issue on air planes</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 2. &nbsp;I wanted to upgrade to the surface pro 4 for the surface book. &nbsp;The only thing I really dislike about the pro 2 is the kickstand. &nbsp;When I am on an airplane (and I fly multiple flights every week), many of the trays don't work with
 the kickstand. &nbsp;Either the computer flips off the tray backwards, or if the kickstand is on the tray, then the keyboard is off the front of the tray too much and you can't type. &nbsp;I always end up using my lap which is difficult for typing also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered the surface book since it doesn't have the kickstand and a more significant keyboard, but that computer is 2x as heavy which is one of the KEY features I like with the surface pro 2 (and 4) since I travel so much an am carrying around my computer
 in a backpack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if there a device you can attach to a surface pro (e.g. case) that eliminates the kickstand?</p>

            use the on-screen soft keyboard (or pen based handwriting) instead of the physical. yeah it's harder, but we are talking about a compromise right?

    <title>Reinstall Windows 8 on a New Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naba123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall Windows 8 on a New Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
I have a HP 2000-453CA Notebook PC. Just so you know, I upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7.&nbsp;I found out that the&nbsp;Hard Drive failed and I am going to replace it soon.&nbsp;I understand that I have to reinstall Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I do not have the&nbsp;recovery discs and I do not have the instillation disc that I used to upgrade to Windows 8<br />
<br />
How can I reinstall the os on the new hard drive if I don't have any recovery or installation discs.<br />
<br />
I heard Windows 8 stores the Product Key in the BIOS, and it will automatically use it to activate Windows.<br />
<br />
If that's true, is it possible to install an iso version of windows 8 and put it on a usb/dvd and install it from there? I also&nbsp;still have the Windows 7 product key, so can I install Windows 7 and use the product key if Windows 8 cannot install.<br />
<br />
Thanks. </p>

            <p>Hello Bibhusan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are experiencing issue with turning on Windows Update Defender and SmartScreen Filter on your computer. I would certainly help you with this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have any third party security software installed on your computer?</li><li>What happens when you try to turn on Windows defender? Do you get any error message?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender turns itself off if it detects another Antivirus program on the computer.&nbsp;This is to avoid conflict with other security software. If you have any other anti virus program installed&nbsp;and running on your computer you need to either disable
 or uninstall from your computer in order to enable Windows Defender. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If however, that is not the case and you are still not able to turn on Windows Defender you may try the Methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span>: </strong><strong>Check Windows Defender Service&nbsp;</strong><strong><br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to make the “Windows defender Service” startup type to “Automatic”.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “<strong>Windows key + R</strong>” from keyboard.<br />
<br />
b. Type “<strong>services.msc</strong>” without quotes in the “<strong>Run</strong>” Window and hit enter.<br />
<br />
c. Search for “<strong>Windows Defender Service</strong>”.<br />
<br />
d. Make “<strong>Startup Type</strong>” to “<strong>Automatic</strong>”.<br />
<br />
e. Restart the computer and then check how it works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span>:&nbsp;Run System File Checker tool to repair system File corruptions if any
</strong><br />
<br />
Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>” to open Charms Bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>”.<br />
<br />
d. Type ‘<strong>sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
<em><span><span>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></em><span>
</span></p>

<h2>            Latest Windows update keeps failing since Feb 18&#47;18</h2>
                    <p>Every day, 3 to 4 times a day, the Update Assistant keeps trying to put the latest upday in with luck.&nbsp; Get a message that I need to get the latest security updates.&nbsp; Then I get a message that there is an update error Ox800704c7 and error Oxc1900208 and
 contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>Initially, on Feb 18, that update also knocked out my Outlook.pst data file so I was unable to access my email.&nbsp; I got Microsoft to come over my shoulder to fix it and after a week, that was finally resolved.&nbsp; However, that person was specifically correcting
 only my Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to contact Microsoft to come over my shoulder to fix Windows...can I get some help please...thanks...kg.</p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, you can try following one of the methods described below.
<br />
<br />As a first troubleshooting option, please find the updates on the Catalog and manually download and install them:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, here is a list of several troubleshooting options.
<br />
<br />1) Below a list of general advices for your situation:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/when-windows-update-gets-stuck-or-frozen-2624439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/when-windows-update-ge...</a>

<br />
<br />2) Alternatively, you can try the below:
<br />
<br />a)  Start –&gt; All Programs –&gt; Accessories –&gt; right click on Command Prompt -&gt; select "Run as Administrator". Type net stop wuauserv to stop Windows Update Service. 
<br />
<br />Wait till you get : The windows update service was stopped successfully. " (DO NOT CLOSE COMMAND PROMPT).
<br />
<br />b)  - Go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution 
<br />- Delete all files in "DataStore" folder
<br />- Delete all files in "Download" folder. 
<br />
<br />c) In the Command prompt window, type net start wuauserv to start Windows Update service. 
<br />
<br />Restart your computer and try to get update again (this should fix the issue permanently).
<br />
<br />3) Reset Windows Update with a script

<p>I tried the catalogue route yesterday before I received your info...after 5 hours of "fixing" it stopped and told me to manually remove my BIOS which is something I most certainly will not do.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>So at this point I would like someone to advise how to back out of this update...I did have some files that got updated...and then how I can permanently stop updates.</p>
<p>

            Dear KatalinGun,
<br />
<br />I'm really sorry you are having such a bad time with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Before answering all your questions, maybe you were asked to reset the BIOS to default settings? 
<br />
<br />If this is, please be sure that is nothing dangerous.
<br />
<br />RESET BIOS TO DEFAULT (if you want, please only option "Use the BIOS menu")
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/131623/how-to-clear-your-computers-cmos-to-reset-bios-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/131623/how-to-clear-y...</a>
<br />
<br />Still, if you want to uninstall any update, you can check which one first:
<br />
<br />CHECK YOUR UPDATE HISTORY
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-update...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you can uninstall it:

<br />
<br />Finally you can hide the unwanted updates:
<br />
<br />SHOW/HIDE UPDATES IN WINDOWS 10

<br />
<br />Please let me know.

            Controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro version, Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.

<p>Just for everyone's info...my laptop...an HP...is only 1 1/2 years old...the BIOS should never have to be deleted to get an update to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does everyone agree...or has my 48 years of computer experience in building and programming gone to the clouds...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for listening...kg.</p>

<p><span>Hello Chris,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype for Web updates automatically. This is to ensure that you can use the web version even on a shared computer. Unfortunately users will not receive notification regarding this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The notifications for updates are only specific for the Skype application depending on the device being used. The account owner is notified and he/she has the option to proceed with
 the update or decline it. However with the new Skype, it updates automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need anything else.
</span></p>
