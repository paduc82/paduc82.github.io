<h2>            Unable to launch ReCore due to an expired trial even though I have Xbox Game Pass</h2>
                    <p>I'm a game pass subscriber. I've spent over 12 hours playing ReCore recently. ReCore is in Xbox Game Pass. I was just playing it and it suddenly kicked me out of the game and said my trial expired. In the Xbox store it says "trial owned" for ReCore, but I should have access through game pass. In the Windows store, it says I own ReCore and doesn't mention a trial. I can't figure out how to get the game to play now on my Xbox.</p>

            <p> I am also having this issue but something I have noticed with the game is that if you uninstall it and view it in the store most Game Pass games it will show the price marked out and the word free written next to it but with recore it has the price marked out but then next to it shows it priced at $19.99 but when I click on the game it tells me that I own it and that I can install it it does not give me an option to purchase</p>

            <p>called xbox support on this issue, wich i am having aswell... They stated a "service alert" on purchase and downloading from the store. The xbox support page only states minecraft having an issue, but support rep stated its in fact all purchases within the last 2-3 days and they are working on it. Guessing this is why recore is on downloading the expired trial version and not the full game..</p>

<h2>            How to Restore &#34;My Documents&#34; folder</h2>
                    I've been keeping all my documents (Word, EXCEL, etc.) in a folder I created myself. Somehow, I've lost the VISTA system My Documents folder. I'll need this to upgrade to WIN-7. How can I restore it to my User File on my Desktop and shift all my files
 into it?

            Vista doesn't really have a "My Documents" folder per se. It's now just called "Documents". If that's where you stored your stuff<br />
then you can do a variety of things the easiest is probably to just open up "Computer" and on the left panel you'll see the "Documents"<br />
folder listed under "Favorite Links". You can right click and drag "Documents" to your desktop and then say it's a short cut.<br />
<br />
Another setting using the Group Policy Editor will do the same thing or you can use a freebie tool called "TweakUI". Just google it
<br />
and you'll find the download link. You may find some of the links say its for XP but it does work on Vista. There's a setting that<br />
says to display your Document folder on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Now if that's NOT where you were keeping them (in the Documents folder that is) and it was just a folder you made on your<br />
desktop it should just be a plain old folder that is now missing. You might try to right click anywhere on the desktop go to "View"
<br />
and select "Auto Arrange" in case the folder got shoved off screen. You can also double click your "Computer Icon" and under
<br />
"Folders" you'll see an item called "Desktop" and it should list anything on your desktop in a list format where you can see it.<br />
<br />
If it's not there, it might have gotten moved accidently in which case you can look in the upper right corner of the screen and<br />
go to "Search" and try and find where it went.<br />
<br />
In any case when you upgrade to Windows 7 it'll still be where ever it was when you were running Vista.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit.<br />
<br />

<h3> carlosrodriguez11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use of the Pen with PDF documents</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know how to use the pen for signatures and markups on PDF documents using the new Surface Pro?</p>
<p>I am trying to avoid having to import the document into One Note to sign and then having to export the link via email (like 3 steps process) to get a single signature but instead have the ability to open the document on the go and get it sign and share.
 Thank you in advance for any suggestions.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Laptop 2 drivers/firmware MSI package is not yet available to download but will be available soon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following workaround is available:<br />
1. Install all available Windows Updates and drivers/firmware on a Surface Laptop 2.<br />
2. Open a Powershell command prompt with administrator credentials.<br />
3. Run the following command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Export-windowsdriver -online -destination c:\drivers<br />
</p>
<p>The drivers can then be used with your deployment tool. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the drivers-firmware package becomes available for download, a link will be provided on the Surface drivers and firmware page at https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023482. Please check back.</p>

    <title>Problem accessing network folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtrevill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem accessing network folder</h2>
                    I recently added a Mac Mini to my home network mix. It is running as my media server. However, the rest of the computers in the house are PCs all running Windows 7 Pro. I also purchased a thunderbolt cable Lacie 4 TB network storage. I'm having network
 access issues when connecting from&nbsp;the PCs to the Mac file storage. &nbsp;I can connect just fine, and have all of the rights figured out. However, when I'm transferring large files (such as movies to the media server), it errors out and looses the connection part
 way through the file transfer (Error says "There is a problem accessing 
\\192.168.0.212\untitled&nbsp; Make sure you are connected to the network and try again). You cannot ever connect if you click the try again button.&nbsp; You have to cancel and then try again.&nbsp; It will never complete a large file, however, if I go to the mac and
 pull the data it works fine. If I try to do anything from the Windows 7 PC side of things, it looses the connection.&nbsp; I've tried multiple Windows 7 computers, I've tried replacing the thunderbolt cable, I've tried replacing the network cables and different
 ports on the routers. I've tried eliminating the Lacie harddrives and the error still exists if I'm coping to a folder directly on the mac. The only time I can get it to work properly is if I do the work from the Mac side of the network.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<h2>            Bottom third of Surface Pro 4 screen jittering&#47;shaking up and down, what can I do to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday the bottom third of my Surface Pro 4's screen has started jittering up and down. I've installed all updates from Windows update, and am on the latest production build of Windows 10. I've tried reinstalling the graphics driver, all other Surface
 Pro 4 drivers, and tried doing the two button reset. I've noticed other people are also experiencing this problem lately, except in the URL below the person says their screen is fine when they're not moving their mouse, however mine shakes uncontrollably no
 matter what I'm doing:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Pretty much exactly this:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk69BrQXxvg</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Surface is actually a replacement from Microsoft that I've only had for a couple months, but&nbsp;the warranty has expired so&nbsp;I'm not able to get it replaced again. What could I do to fix this? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>You get 90 days of warranty when you replace your sp4 or the balance of your warranty,
<strong>whichever is longer</strong>. &nbsp;So if ur sp4 was replaced under warranty within the last 90 days u r are still covered!!</p>

If the jitter occurs on ac, battery and when in the UEFI screens then, yes, you are, unfortunately, sol.

You should contact Microsoft and talk to them in a reasonable manner and they might do something for you. You have nothing to lose and definitely worth a shot: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers</a>

<p>
</p><p>"<span> </span><span>Can you ask them to contact support?&nbsp; That’s a failure mode we’re trying to get root cause on right now, so I would like them to talk to an agent.&nbsp; The agent will probably set up a replacement
 so we can get the device."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From ME: if they ask you to pay $29 just to talk to them, and actually charge you, dispute it with your credit card company. Microsoft needs these devices so they can figure out what is causing this.</span></p>

            Sebastian, I sent another email. Are you in the USA? If yes, can you go to a physical retail Microsoft Store (and show THEM this post). The engineers state they want these devices so they can track down the issue. If front line support won't cooperate,
 it doesn't help you or anyone else.

            <p><span>Thank you again, and I'm Canadian so i could go to a store, but my only concern is proving this (that engineers are looking to collect them), since when I showed the support agent this post they specifically said because you aren't a Microsoft employee
 what you said didn't hold. The employee didn't believe this was an issue engineers were looking for devices on. It would be great if I had some kind of actual proof I have direction from an engineer to do this, so i could have some assurance they would actually
 comply, which would make the hour long drive to a store more worth the shot. For example, if an actual MS employee commented on this post and gave clear instructions for me to do this maybe that would be good? Or if the engineer could add special instructions
 to my "file" tied to my account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) that support could access?</span></p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for trying to help me. </p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Screen Sharing with Multiple Monitors - Presenting status does not change</h2>
                    <span><br />
                    <span><br />
</span>
<div>
<p>I have 3 individual monitors that I using as a base set up. When I attempt to share one of my screens using Skype for Business 2016, my status never changes to "Presenting - Do Not Disturb". I always have to make this change manually and change it back from
 DND when I'm finished. I've tried changing the switches "Show me as DND when I present my desktop" but this has no effect. Is there something additional that needs to be addressed to enable the "Presenting DND" status when I share my screens. I'm using Windows
 10 as an OS and Office 365. &nbsp;When I use the laptop individually without the multiple screens, the status changes automatically when I screen share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<span>Hi Waldolc,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>After you selected the Options “Show me as Do Not Disturb when I present my desktop”, when you share the
<strong>Primary Monitor</strong> and <strong>All Monitors</strong>, it will show <strong>
Do Not Disturb</strong>, when you share any other monitors, it won’t change. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Actually, it’s expected behavior. Regarding this, some users have same requirement (when share other monitors, the status should change) with you, I suggest you to
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/31962634-update-statuses-to-do-not-disturb-or-presenting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
vote</a> in the Skype for Business feedback center. Microsoft will always take notice of users’ feedback and comments and try to make you a better experience for our products.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for your understanding,</span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 UEFI stuck problems</h2>
                    I have 35 SP3 and have now had 4 that have gotten stuck at UEFI screen. It is almost like SSD has failed, however after many retries of volume + power I can sometimes get them to boot. I am wondering if anyone has tried to manually update UEFI from WinPE
 boot environment? These machines were all working fine one day and then died. I also had one that immediately failed during MDT based imaging where the FW was attempted during imaging. I have now abandoned that process. Just trying to figure out if there is
 something happening I can prevent. In the end I just swap device at store but still frustrating.

    <title>Storage Space Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart hansted  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Space Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've got storage space pool, setup with 5 2TB SATA drives. It has (had) 1 parity VD, on a 2012 R2 server.</p>
<p>One of this disks failed, and now the VD is offline. Why is this so? Shouldn't this have been able to withstand the failure of 1 drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's kind of the point of having the parity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pool itself is showing degraded as would be expected, but the VD wont come back online. I'm guessing the DetachedReason Incomplete is saying that there's not enough available information on the remaining disks to bring the VD online, but again, WHY!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like the data back obviously, but more important is knowing why this happened. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how this is supposed to work. If this was a standard RAID5, this would have been a non issue apart from replacing the disk. I was planning
 on using storage spaces in the future , but this really doesn't instil me with confidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried attaching it, but is fails. Event log shows the following.</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p>Drives hosting data for storage space {0f004b58-9546-11e4-80c7-4061862b6b5a} have failed or are missing. As a result, no copy of data is available. Return Code: This device does not exist.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm currently installing all available updates in the hope it will recover the array.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi Colin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that even though you have a processor that is 64 bit, your Windows is 32 bit. You will not be able to run software for x64 processors unless you install 64 bit Windows. Your computer is capable of 64 bit, but you are effectively 32 bit due to
 Windows being 32 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            it showed that 64 is the Maximum Bit Length,&nbsp; a Yes for the Hardware D.E.P, and No for Hardware Virtualization, so when i installed Windows 10 for 32 bit, i should have installed the 64 Bit one?, i should have installed the 64 bit one? Is it possible to
 go back to Windows 7 and then install 64? because i cannot install the 64 bit version of Windows 10 while i have the 32 bit version of it already on.

            Actually once you have upgraded to win 10 there is no need to go back to win 7.&nbsp; You can clean install (format) 64bit directly.&nbsp; You simply need to boot from the expanded ISO and run setup from there.

            This sort of question is answered by the manufacturer's documentation for your particular model.<br />
<br />
In your case, the answer is 4 GB: <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/op330/en/ug/sdspecs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/op330/en/ug/sdspecs.htm</a><br />
<br />
Read the Note regarding maximum memory at the linked page so you won't be disappointed if you go out and buy more memory.&nbsp; The actual amount of RAM reported by Windows XP when there is 4 GB physically installed will probably be around 3.2 GB or so.&nbsp; The exact
 amount will depend on various hardware devices installed in your computer that use part of the "memory address space" even though they don't use the actual RAM.<br />

            Hello Tracy, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn’t provide users with the option to merge two or more audio files. However, you can go to the Windows Store to search for the application that offers a feature to merge/link the .wav files.
<br />
<br />Best regards, 
<br />Alexander B.

<h3> inhumanbow823  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Capture not working after &#34;Alt-Tab&#34;ing out of a game.</h2>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hello. I am posting this question in hopes that either someone has an easy solution or Microsoft will see and maybe include something in future updates that would prevent this from happening.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently looked at the updates that are being brought to the Xbox app. I love the app and it work great 95% of the time with the occasional problem but most of the time its great. My issue is with Game Captures using Background Recording. I kept getting
 a 30 second clip of pitch black with audio. I have researched the issue online and it has something to do with when you Alt-Tab out of a game the Background Recording stops. I am assuming this is because the app no longer recognizes that it should continue
 background recording when you re-enter the game. Research online has showed that in your Task Manager you can see in Services an XBGM service that is the background recording and i have confirmed that it stops when you tab out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said previously, I love the app but would love to make it better.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for anyone that can help.</p>

</p><p>Some games do not allow recordings, so that may be your issue why you are getting just audio and no video.&nbsp;</p>

            I appreciate your response but its rocket league and it does allow recordings because until i alt tab out to go to discord or something the recording works great. its only after the tab out does it record a blank screen :)

<p>You might also want to contact the maker of your graphics card for that issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way that background recording works, is that a game renders the graphics to a special window area (which is full screen in your situation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when you change to a different window, and the full screen app "disappears", the graphics card has no window plane to render to, and therefore the Xbox capturing app doesn't have anything to capture anymore, which is why there is a black screen
 and no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the game window changes to a still visible smaller window among other windows, there is nothing you can do, as the graphics card isn't rendering anything in it's memory, as long as the game window is not visible.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mail app no longer connecting to Gmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrysmith_53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail app no longer connecting to Gmail</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I
 have a desktop and a laptop PC both running Windows 8.1. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I
 have three email accounts (Outlook.com, Gmail and another IMAP account). All three of these accounts have worked perfectly with the Mail app until recently. The problem described below does not affect the desktop, just the laptop and has arisen in the last
 week for no reason that I can tie to any other change.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Here's
 what I see:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Launch
 Mail app</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">List
 of available inboxes (3) appears in bottom left corner as usual except the Gmail item has a message in yellow underneath saying “Needs attention”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tapping
 on the Gmail account item brings up a screen-wide message box headed “Updating your Gmail account”. Under that is a message in red saying “There was a problem connecting to Gmail. Do you want to try again?” Then two buttons labelled “Yes” and “Cancel”. Tapping
 “Yes” has no effect and the message box remains (or simply reappears instantaneously). Tapping “Cancel” closes the message box and returns to the Mail app main screen with the same yellow message under Gmail. This is an endless loop with no way out except
 to close the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When
 going to Settings/Accounts from the Mail app, via the Charms bar, there is no opportunity to do anything to the Gmail account as any action on that account item (tap, left or right click)&nbsp;just brings up the same message box described above. (i.e. can’t edit
 or delete the account from the Mail app).</span></p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have deleted and re-installed the
 Mail app with no effect. I have 2-step authentication on my Gmail account and have tried revoking and re-instating that. I have no opportunity to insert a new password for the Gmail account in Mail.</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Just to be clear, there
 does not appear to be any problem with my Gmail account which is still accessible as normal in a browser or the Mail app on my desktop.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks for anybody's help...</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi Isha - thanks for your help. Unfortunately, I still seem to have the problem. With reference to you points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I had already done that.</p>
<p>2) I am not using a proxy.</p>
<p>3) As I mentioned in my original post, I cannot do anything with the Gmail account in the Mail app. I can't get past the message&nbsp;box I described. I am fairly sure that if I could just delete the account from Mail, I could add it again successively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would point out that it had been working just fine for many months previously and continues to work on my desktop PC.</p>

</p><p>While I do use Outlook 2013 on my desktop (which does not have a problem), I do not use Outlook on my laptop. The problem is with the Mail app on my laptop, not Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Start Menu keeps popping up on Startup &#38; Booting is taking too much time.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I had been facing the foll. issues ever since I have installed Windows 10:&nbsp;<br />
1. Start Menu keeps popping up on startup before it gets fully ready to be used (~5-6 minutes).<br />
2. Windows is taking too much time to start. Around 5-6 minutes. It reaches the desktop screen in 1-2 minutes, however takes too much time to be fully ready to use.<br />
<br />
P.S. Have already optimized Startup Manager. Would have to uninstall Win10 if the issues aren't resolved.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had performed the steps as suggested. Issue didn't occur in Safe Mode. But still, performed a 'Restricted' Clean Boot, that is didn't Disable all Apps under Startup tab of Task Manager.</p>
<p>Uninstalled a few apps that run on Startup. And it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not getting the issue anymore though, but still keeping an eye if by any chance it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. FYI, Answers to your queries:</p>
<p>1.<em> Did you make any changes in prior to this issue?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.
<em>Which anti-virus program is installed on the PC?</em></span></p>
<p>MS Essentials got replaced by Windows Defender on upgrade. Not using any other Anti-Virus besides this.</p>
<p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi only1dil,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In which drive are you ceating the simple volume?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to perform steps as an Administrator and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can first shrink volume, if you are trying to create a new partition, then select the
 new volume and create a simple volume.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you create partitions on a basic disk using Disk Management, the first three volumes you create will
 be formatted as primary partitions. Beginning with the fourth volume, each volume will be configured as a logical drive within an extended partition.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Computer Management by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Maintenance</strong>, clicking <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>, and then double-clicking
<strong>Computer Management</strong>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Navigation pane, under
<strong>Storage</strong>, click <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click an unallocated region on your hard disk, and then click
<strong>New Simple Volume</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>New Simple Volume Wizard</strong>, click <strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the size of the volume you want to create in megabytes (MB) or accept the maximum default size, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Accept the default drive letter or choose a different drive letter to identify the partition, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Format Partition</strong> dialog box, do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you don't want to format the volume right now, click
<strong>Do not format this volume</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To format the volume with the default settings, click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Review your choices, and then click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</span></p>

<p>Correct.&nbsp; I am using the Windows Fax and Scan app on Windows 2012 server.&nbsp; When I go to CONTROL PANEL -&gt; PHONE &amp; MODEM then EDIT My Location I put a 1 in the box next to "To access an outside line for long distance calls dial".&nbsp; However, when I go to Windows
 Fax and Scan it doesn't dial a 1 for long distance calls therefore my faxes are failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the internet it sounds like this is also happening on Windows 10, but worked fine on Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks for&nbsp; the quick reply and thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Any update? I have a very similar issue with our fax server. All long distance calls result in "No Answer", yet local faxes will complete. Thanks</p>

You should also follow Microsoft's advisory and upgrade only when offered through Windows Update:</p>
