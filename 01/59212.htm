<h2>            Steam games do not work after latest update</h2>
                    I installed the latest update to Windows 10, version 1703 last night. When I came to open some games on Steam just now, games that were working just fine before the update now either won't work at all (E.g. Sniper Elite 3 opened then immediately crashed
 with a 'stopped working' error message) or have appalling performance (e.g. Assassin's Creed IV worked fine before, now has huge lag issues even on low settings). The only thing to change is the update. any thoughts?

    <title>Can&#39;t listen to microphone through headphones in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evil667overlord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t listen to microphone through headphones in Windows 10 without audio delay</h2>
                    <p>To listen to my microphone via my speakers and without any audio delay, I can right-click the volume icon, select Playback Devices, right-click the Speakers device then select Properties, go to the Levels tab then finally raise the level of Pink Input (aka
 microphone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I select Headphones in the Playback tab instead, I cannot see the slider for Pink Input or Microphone. I only see the output volume slider for the headphones themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Levels tab in the Playback device properties works fantastic with no delay at all but the Microphone slider only shows for the Speakers device, not for the Headphones device. What can I do to enable the Microphone (Pink Input) slider in the Headphones
 Playback device properties?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usual answer Microsoft Agents give on here to the many other people with this issue is to suggest going to the Recording tab instead of Playback, right-clicking on the Microphone, selecting the Levels tab and enabling Listen To This Device... Please
 do not waste time suggesting this answer as this Listen feature is broken on every PC I have ever tried it on. It introduces a huge audio delay between the microphone and headset, effectively rendering the feature unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Please also don't waste time telling me how to adjust my microphone recording level - people can hear my mic just fine. I want to hear my mic through the headphones without an audio delay, I do not need to to adjust my recording volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, there's no point telling me it's a hardware problem, that the Listen feature in the Recording tab should work without delay or request information about my system as this problem exists on every copy of Windows 10 I've ever used on many different
 PCs and laptops owned by myself and others. In addiion, looking over this very forum will reveal many people with the same issue who have not been given a proper solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to replicate this on your own PC, it is really easy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Plug in a headset with microphone into 3.5mm jacks at the front or rear of your PC. Ideally, also have some speakers connected to see the problem easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Right-click the Volume icon on the system tray and select Sounds. Select the Recordings tab then right-click your microphone device and select Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Go to the Levels tab and click the Listen to this Device checkbox. Select Apply and talk into your mic to notice an unbearable audio delay. This should prove that the Listen feature is essentially broken in Windows 10. Deselect the Listen To This Device
 checkbox and click Ok before continuing to try the other approach...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. This time select the Playback tab instead and right-click your Speakers device then select Properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Go to the Levels tab and adjust the level for Pink Input (or whatever your microphone shows as). Speak into your microphone and notice that this plays back without any audio delay but plays through your speakers - we now want to make this play via the
 headphones instead so lower/mute the Mic level on Speakers again and click Ok to close the Speakers device properties window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. On the Playback tab, right-click the Headphones item and select Properties. Go to the Levels tab and you'll see the slider for Microphone (or Pink Input) no longer exists. There's only an output volume slider for the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Give up in frustration and write a long post on answers .microsoft.com detailing the problem, fully expecting not to be given a useful andswer since so many others have already been fobbed off with requests to use the broken Listen feature or told it's
 a hardware issue - which is demonstrably false.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, Vijay. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly the proposed solutions are not related to my issue. My microphone is already accessible to apps, otherwise I wouldn't be able to use it at all, which is not the issue I was reporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am talking about headphones plugged into a 3.5mm jack here - there are no custom driver issues to consider as Windows has support for this built in. I have however installed the latest motherboard audio drivers, which unsurprisingly make no difference
 as this is demonstrably an operating system issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am reporting exists on every Windows 10 machine I've encountered and has two causes:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Microsoft removed the ability to forward the microphone input directly to the headphones via the Playback tab of the Sounds dialog. You can forward it seamlessly to the speakers but not the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Microsoft have never addressed the long-running issue that introduces an audio delay to the Listen feature in the microphone properties in the Recordings tab of the Sounds dialog. This delay occurs on every Windows 10 PC I have seen and is plainly an
 OS bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I included a 7-step guide to replicating this issue in my original post and recommend you follow it if you want to understand the problem.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>SUMMARY OF ISSUE:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>HI ROS!&nbsp; WOULDN'T MY EASIEST SOLUTION MAYBE BE TO ....... SAFELY REMOVE | UNINSTALL ALL NVIDIA APPS from my WINDOWS 10 PRO LAPTOP ...... Hopefully,
 without damaging or sabotaging my LAPTOP’S OPERATION, FUNCTIONALITY &amp; PERFORMANCE?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Dear Ros Reymichael!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many, many thanks for your reply, which I did not expect.</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your 3 questions and suggestions, but the truth is .........</span></p>
<p><span>.......... I DO NOT BELIEVE I NEED NVIDIA SOFTWARE, at all on my new laptop ---&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-------- I DO NO GAMING AT ALL --- So I don't think i need NVIDIA at all on my DELL XPS LAPTOP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>----- So I did none of the three&nbsp;(3) actions you asked me about: (VIZ. NO CHANGES or UPDATES, NO UPDATE to GRAPHICS CARD, NO TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS)</span></p>
<p><span>................. (To be honest, I'm not really knowledgeable or competent enough to do any of the above steps you suggested.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, I just uninstalled the NVIDIA GRAPHICS SOFTWARE (NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVER 384.77), which ALSO removed the NVIDIA "graphics" shortcut from my desktop,
 the shortcut that gave me the "error" message, as previously described to you ...</span></p>
<p><span>.... Viz:&nbsp;primary display's adapter does not support NVIDIA 3D Vision. Error. Windows 10 Pro.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, after uninstalling the NVIDIA GRAPHICS SOFTWARE (NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVER 384.77), 2 or 3 days ago ---</span></p>
<p><span>---- NVIDIA HAS, ONCE AGAIN, AUTOMATICALLY RE-INSTALLED the&nbsp;NVIDIA GRAPHICS SOFTWARE (NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVER 384.77) back onto my
 computer (which irritates me) ....</span></p>
<p><span>................ So, once again, I am faced with the SAME PROBLEM AGAIN.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOW, all I want to do; is to TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY UNINSTALL ---</span></p>
<p><span>----- All the NVIDIA SOFTWARE FROM MY LAPTOP ....</span></p>
<p><span>.............. And I ask you please to answer this simple question for me:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I DO NOT EVER, EVER, EVER play any games --- and i do not need any superior graphics, etc ....</span></p>
<p><span>............. I DON'T BELIEVE I NEED ANY NVIDIA or GEOFORCE SOFTWARE | APPS, at all ... on my laptop ....</span></p>
<p><span>................. So if I totally UNINSTALL all NVIDIA SOFTWARE from my laptop ----</span></p>
<p><span>------------- If it will not sabotage or mess up my use of my laptop ---</span></p>
<p><span>------------------- THEN I BELIEVE COMPLETELY UNINSTALLING all NVIDIA SOFTWARE from my laptop ----&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>--------------- Will be my easiest, most straightforward and simplest solution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I primarily use my DELL XPS 15 for is&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>---&nbsp; Microsoft 2016 programs like --- OUTLOOK, WORD, EXCEL, etc</span></p>
<p><span>----- Internet: Google Chrome &amp; Microsoft Edge --- &amp; YouTube ...</span></p>
<p><span>...............&nbsp; And hardly anything more than the above very simple, straightforward purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please can you be so kind as to tell me ..........</span></p>
<p><span>.......... If you think, totally UNISTALLING all NVIDIA software should SOLVE MY PROBLEM.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don't want NVIDIA, and I don't think I need it --- FOR MY OPERATING SYSTEM (which is Windows 10 Pro) ...</span></p>
<p><span>.......... And the operation of my LAPTOP ....</span></p>
<p><span>...</span><span>................ So why not just get rid of it, COMPLETELY??</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your soonest reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards and thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>David&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"If you think, totally UNISTALLING all NVIDIA software should SOLVE MY PROBLEM" - Are you referring to NVIDIA graphics card or NVIDIA 3D Vision? If you're referring to
</span><span>NVIDIA 3D Vision, </span><span>the cause of the error is due to incompatibility of your graphics card.

 of the </span><span>NVIDIA 3D Vision. To uninstall </span><span>NVIDIA 3D Vision, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows Start</strong> and type Programs and Features.</li><li>Click on<strong> Programs and Features.</strong></li><li>Look for NVIDIA 3D Vision Driver or NVIDIA Vision Controller Driver.</li><li><span>Click on uninstall and follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer.</span></li></ol>

 ----- IF I CAN, WHICH I'M SURE I CAN??</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following your advice, and what I'd also thought was a "perfect solution" ....</span><br />
<span>....... I fully uninstalled the whole of NVIDIA -- Completely off my new Dell XPS with Windows 10 Pro.</span><br />
</p>

</p>
<p><span>............ I have TWICE totally installed NVIDIA off my laptop ..........</span></p>
<p><span>.................. BUT THE NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVER --- &amp; THE "automatic shortcut" on my desktop ....</span></p>
<p><span>......................... Which REMINDS me of it ---------</span></p>
<p><span>SO MY PROBLEM IS ...... NVIDIA GRAPHICS ----</span></p>

<p><span>............................. And I want to get RID OF NVIDIA, totally and forever --- IF I CAN, WHICH I'M SURE I CAN??</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that I obviously want ALL OTHER UPDATES to be automatically installed ---</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>---- But specifically NOT NVIDIA &amp; GEOFORCE ---</span></p>
<p><span>------------- Because I'm NOT A GAMER, as I explained in my last message to you.</span></p>

<p>Dear Reymichael Ros,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thoroughly dissatisfied, and this is why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are shifting responsibility onto Nvidia's back.&nbsp;<span>You are passing the buck onto Nvidia.</span></p>
<span>~ These automatic</span>&nbsp;Nvidia Updates are facilitated and organized by your Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Operating System on my new laptop ......
<p>...... And as such I would expect YOU AT MICROSOFT to NOT SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY TO NVIDIA, which is exactly and precisely what you are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had taken ownership of this joint MICROSOFT | NVIDIA problem --- You would have learnt how to resolve it, so that the next time this happens to another person
<em>(and the same problem happens to many other Microsoft </em><span><em>Customers, many other people just like me -- WITH NO RESOLUTIONS ON THE INTERNET)&nbsp;</em></span> ......</p>
<p>..... You would then have known how to resolve this issue, which you now will not be able to do ...........</p>
<p>................... As you are "SHIFTING &amp; SIDESTEPPING" your responsibility ....&nbsp; What I see as your responsibility, because this is a joint MICROSOFT | NVIDIA problem: Because MICROSOFT is&nbsp; implicitly allowing NVIDIA to "take over" and "control" and "invade"
 your and my WINDOWS 10 PRO operating system, by allowing them to do automatic updates, even though I've now totally UNINSTALLED NVIDIA about 3 or 4 times from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I am totally dissatisfied and unimpressed with you and Microsoft.</p>
<p>You are NOT TAKING&nbsp; OWNERSHIP and resolving what is YOUR ISSUE on YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM, because by not assisting me, you are totally allowing an OUTSIDE COMPANY, to HIJACK and INVADE my computer with your OPERATING SYSTEM ---
</p>
<p>---- And you are providing me with NO SOLUTION ON HOW TO GET RID OF NVIDIA PERMANENTLY AND FOREVER, and to BLOCK THEM FROM INVADING my computer, which has your Windows 10 Pro O.S. running it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

</p><p>My bf and I bought an Asus with Windows 10 installed about 4 months ago and it is the second time we get a blue screen error in two days. Last time, the system repaired itself and worked out afterwards. This time, however, the screen is in an eternal loop
 of reeboting. We got two different messages during this reeboting. The first is a blue screen that indicates the error code 0xC0000185 and the second says "Port 0: micron_1100_MTFDDAK256TBN &nbsp; &nbsp;S.M.A.R.T Status Bad, Backup and Replace."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is brand new and we cannot even turn it on to scan the HD to see if there is any problem with it. How would Microsoft recomment for us to proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. We managed to get it working.</p>
<p>However after we turned the computer back on, we ran a diagnostic in the hard drive and it indicated that the HD is in 100%. Could that be the reason for the glitch? Is there anything we should do?</p>
<p>

            It's good to know that your computer is now working. For us to provide the best answer to your questions, we'd like to verify if the HD diagnostics indicates that it's 100% full storage capacity?<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

</p><p>I think it is sort of assumed that W10 will remain the platform name going forward.&nbsp; W10 has had 2 or major new releases since first introduced.&nbsp; We are expecting a new release in Sept.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>New enhancements will just get added without a new release "edition" that might formerly have been called W11, W12, etc.</p>

            This person may be on to something though. I and many other people can't run Windows 10 16199 and higher. Seems we only can run 10.16199. They say in Feedback hub it is known and being worked on. Meanwhile I am warming my Win 8.1 disk for the DVD tray.

<p>Have you uninstalled following third party software: anti virus software,&nbsp;firewall software,&nbsp;backup software. You could also try stopping Windows Defender and Security Guard and try the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you performed a system clean including Disk Cleanup? Have you tried Windows Troubleshooter? SFC? DISM? All these normally resolve the issue of updates failing to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have run Disk Cleanup which will remove any previous updates Windows Update will begin fresh download, once this has happened before installing or rebooting you can create the ISO from which you can install directly from your drive.</p>

<div>Your laptop probably has a 'concealed' numerical keypad centred on a key 
near K and accessed by using a Function (Fn) key together with one of the 
top-row F keys. To enter a character using this concealed numpad, first enable 
it by pressing, say, Fn+F8, then use Alt-0161 to enter the character (that 
should be ¡), then press Fn+F8 again to disable the numpad so you can type 
normally. Find the right key combination for NUMLOCK in the documentation for 
your laptop.

<h2>            Black screen at startup - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Blackscreen like none other..&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I wanna say Hi !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not let's get to the point :</p>
<p>So I had this weird blackscreen that I did not find on the internet.When i boot up my computer a flash with the asus motherboard shows just a sec, then blackscreen than another sec the windows logo (8.1) then blackscreen forever.After maybe like 20 restarts
 it worked and everything was showing fine. I thougt it would be from the video card so i sent her up to service, they said it is true the card is broken and gave me the money back (R9 270X)</p>
<p>So I've bought a R9 280X MSI Gaming 3 GB edition from a store together with a new asus motherboard and an i7 3770 and some new ram memory.</p>
<p>Same problem : THE EXACTLY SAME BLACKSCREEN WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS ( HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the card again?Could i be that unlucky?</p>
<p>Can the PSU do this (TECNOWARE 550 W Black Core)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT IS GOING ON? I changed everything beside the HDD and the PSU oh and the Windows 8.1 x64 but I don't think it has anything to do with that.</p>
<p>Please help, i really tried to find this problem on the internet bu couldn't find it ! :(</p>

            <p><span>Hello Mav,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected and I will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue such as hardware corruption (like RAM or graphic card corrupted), external device conflict, display driver corruption, hard drive corruption, system file corruption due to virus.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you able to boot the computer to the desktop?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Is there any external devices connected with the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to boot the computer to the desktop and still you getting black screen, then I would suggest you to refer the steps from this link and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/black-screen-windows-81/778e1c92-ab80-4979-96f9-3f8a66ff75bd"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/black-screen-windows-81/778e1c92-ab80-4979-96f9-3f8a66ff75bd</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are able to boot the computer to the desktop, then I would suggest you to update the display driver and try to run a memory diagnostic tool to check the RAM performance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try to <strong>update the display drivers</strong> through<strong> Device Manger.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>from the keyboard and click on
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. <strong>Device Manager</strong> Window will be open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. <strong>Double click </strong>on <strong>Display adaptor</strong>. (It will show you the list of display drivers).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>display driver</strong> and click on
<strong>Update driver</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e. <strong>Restart the computer</strong>. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to this Microsoft article:<strong> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Run Windows Memory Diagnostics utility<span>. </span></strong>Windows 8.1 includes built-in features to help you identify and diagnose problems with memory. Refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + R</strong>&nbsp;on the Keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Type&nbsp;<strong>mdsched.exe</strong>&nbsp;in the Search box, and then press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Choose whether to restart the computer and run the tool immediately or schedule the tool to run at the next restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Windows Memory Diagnostics runs automatically after the computer restarts and performs a standard memory test automatically. If you want to perform fewer or more tests, press F1, use the Up and Down arrow keys to set the Test Mix as Basic, Standard,
 or Extended, and then press F10 to apply the desired settings and resume testing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. When testing is completed, the computer restarts automatically. You’ll see the test results when you log on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer the article below for information on Memory diagnostic tool.</span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>&nbsp;appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows
 mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue does not appear in safe mode, there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure to update the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the&nbsp;major on-board and<br />
separate device drivers. Check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker</p>
<p>for custom systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask<br />
in their forums&nbsp;(if any)&nbsp;about any known issues.<br />
<br />
After the above and if needed :<br />
<br />
Be sure the time and date are correct in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Uninstall any 3rd party antivirus which have been known to cause these issues. Use<br />
Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 is a full antivirus.<br />

<p>Thanks for the fast answer but,</p>
<p>The thing is this problem persists only the first time I start the PC in one day.</p>
<p>Ex: So I start the Pc for the first time for today, i restart till it works, than I can go into safe mode and the problem isn't there, what my point is, is that ,that I can't go into safe mode before going into normal. Because I don't see anything and the
 problem begins before even loading the bios... as I said when I press the button it is black already and there are just a few flashes with the bios loading and then with windows loading.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
NETIO.sys is a Windows component so the error means that something drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
The most common CAUSE are the network drivers in use and/or&nbsp;a 3rd party antivirus. Check with the System Maker's Support&nbsp;(Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems), on-line drivers, and ask in their forum (if any) about known issues. And check with the actual device
 maker for even newer driver versions or if using a separate network device. Update the network driver in use.<br />
<br />
Uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and then run its maker's removal tool to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;trouble<br />
causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus<br />
and a true superstar in detection and compatibility.<br />

Also check with the System/Motherboard Maker for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset
<p>drivers, and the on-board device drivers. And with the separate device makers for updates<br />
to those drivers.<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update<strong> BIOS </strong>and <strong>chipset</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

For the Windows&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />
at top&nbsp;of list&nbsp;- click it. <strong>in Windows 8/8.1/10 the&nbsp;name is "Windows Memory
<br />
Diagnostic".<br />
</strong><br />
================================================</p>
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the <br />
top&nbsp;of the original reply above.)<br />
<br />

<h2>            Connecting Fitbit One to PC with Microsoft 10</h2>
                    <p>I tried steps suggested in this forum.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed the fitbit app from the mobile devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth finds a "base station" but indicates it is unrecognized.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue tooth asks if I wants to "pair" the devices.&nbsp; The error message says
 "That did not work.&nbsp; Try again and make sure your devices is still discoverable".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make the device discoverable?&nbsp; It is charged.&nbsp; It is turned on.&nbsp; I have the app from the app store.</p>
<p>What else can I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated.</p>

<p>Salve, qualcun'altro ha notato delle piccole macchie (o aloni) sulla scocca laterale destra e posteriore della Xbox One? Chiedo perchè la mia sembra sia un dalmata. Non che compromette le funzionalità della console, ma è una seccatura
 da non poco considerando che la console ha meno di 4 mesi di vita.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Io le ho notate oggi. Dopo aver spolverato sono comparse. Nessun detergente usato, solo il panno antistatici. Già non mi piaceva questa parte lucida dove la polvere si vede all istante. Ora a macchie è proprio inguardabile.</p>

<p>If all is clean, let's try a repair install to replace the problem files, and also to make sure other system files are good.</p>
<p>The "repair" (in-place upgrade) install will not effect your installed programs or data.&nbsp; Just make sure you are already logged into your computer when you start the install.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not boot from the DVD.<br />
<br />
If the installation does not start automatically when you insert the DVD,&nbsp;run setup.exe from your DVD drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Setup program starts and the&nbsp;Install now&nbsp;screen appears,&nbsp;click Install now.</li><li>Note When you receive with the Get important updates for installation message, click&nbsp;Go Online.</li><li>Click&nbsp;Upgrade&nbsp;when the Which type of installation do you want? screen appears</li></ul>

            Trying to start a Remote Desktop Connection you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
The system cannot find the file specified.<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\&lt;LANG_NAME&gt;\mstsc.exe.MUI<br />
<br />
or:<br />
<br />
The system cannot find the file specified.<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\&lt;LANG_NAME&gt;\mstscax.dll.MUI<br />
<br />
Followed by:<br />
<br />
An error occurred while loading the Terminal Services ActiveX control.<br />
Please make sure the correct version of mstscax.dll is in the path<br />
<br />
An error occurred.<br />
Try to reconnect.&nbsp; If the problem continues, contact the owner of the remote computer or your network administrator.<br />
<br />
You are probably missing one or both of these files (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\en-us\<b>mstsc.exe.mui</b><br />
c:\windows\system32\en-us\<b>mstscax.dll.mui<br />
<br />
</b>Note that running sfc /scannow will not replace these files.&nbsp; That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for (Sorry, Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").<b><br />
<br />
</b>You can get these files from your genuine bootable XP installation CD or from my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 files you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\en-us</b><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>mstsc </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>mstsc.exe.mui</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to copy/paste the downloaded files in the correct folder(s) on your system.<b><br />
<br />

            You're getting closer!<br />
<br />
RD is supposed to come built in to XP so I wonder how those files can be missing?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Has your Remote Desktop ever worked before and if so, what do you think happened since the last time it did work?<br />
<br />
Are you sure you put the mstsc.exe.mui file out there on your system?<br />
<br />
You should have a bunch of .msi files in that folder.<br />
<br />
If you find you need more files, I zipped up all the .mui files in that en-us folder on my system and put that out there too and it is called:<br />
<br />
<b>en-US.zip</b><br />
<br />
I don't know if I would blindly just replace all the files -&nbsp; just the ones that are missing.<br />
<br />

<h2>            DHCP option 252 wpad issue</h2>
                    <p>This is more of a bug report now I've located a fix, would be nice if someone could weigh in on whether this will be patched or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deploying option 252 in a dhcp scope deploys proxy.pac location to the client registry:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-19\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Wpad</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>when moving to a new scope without option 252 this location is not forgotten and proxy continues to prompt for authentication until registry key is manually deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this by design or a bug?</p>

            Deleting the registry key I mentioned fixes the problem, I want to know if this is going to be fixed at some point so manually deleting the key isn't necessary and the registry is updated automatically depending upon if the subnet has the option deployed
 or not?
