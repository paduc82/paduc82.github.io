<h2>            I restarted my computer and EVERYTHING is gone.</h2>
                    It's all just gone. Everything that was pinned to my start menu, everything- except programs i've installed and my recycle bin contents.
<br />
<br />
I went to MS config to go to the Startup tab and turn some stuff off that was starting up when my computer did, Curse Client, Steam, and some others, and noticed that there were a LOT of things checked. I unchecked them all and restarted- and when i did, everything
 was gone. My windows desktop is back to default, all my system settings are too.&nbsp; I'm really really confused- I went back into MSConfig and i re-enabled everything and restarted again, but still the same.

<h3> blusher38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install new usb modem on my new netbook loaded with Windows 7.</h2>
                    My Novatel MC930D usb broadband modem failed to run in Windows 7 on my new netbook. The moment the usb modem is inserted into 1 of the 3 usb ports, the computer immediate shuts down. Otherwise, upon running the install mobilink device software, the installation
 will auto erase the setup and failed the installation.<br />
<br />
Vendor said it has something to do with the usb modem driver that Windows 7 does not recognised. However, when I tried the modem on another pc loaded with Windows 7, it worked.<br />
<br />
Please advice.

            Hi Blusher38,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which version of Windows 7 is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
I would also suggest try connecting the modem to different USB port on the notebook and check if that works fine.<br />
<br />
This seems to be an issue with the drivers for the USB modem. There are no latest drivers available for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
<br />
Uninstall all the drivers related to the modem from Device Manager and try installing the drivers from the link below.<br />
<br />
<strong>Downloads: Novatel Wireless Ovation MC950D/MC930D USB Modem - HSHPA/HSDPA/UTMS:
<a href="http://www.novatelwireless.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=280&amp;Itemid=526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.novatelwireless.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=280&amp;Itemid=526</a>
<br />
</strong><br />
As a workaround you may try install the drivers for Vista in Vista Compatibility mode and check if you are able to connect to the modem.<br />
<br />
To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the program icon, click Properties, and then click the Compatibility tab.<br />
<br />
<strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
I would suggest that you temporarily disable anti-virus installed on the computer and check. Make sure to enable the anti-virus on the computer.<br />

<h2>            How to lock an unlocked bitlocker drive &#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>And the answer is "You can't".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has had bitlocker for almost a decade and still no way to lock a drive back that has been unlocked. REALLY !!</p>
<p>Disconnect it or restart the whole system. That's it. Still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please don't give me some command line administrator level rigamarole. Or even worse, some regedit ordeal that only gets it working for one machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make this really good feature useful and FIX IT. Like right click on the drive and get an option to lock it back. Someday ??</p>

            You don't seem to understand.&nbsp; If the drive is locked, you can't even boot-up.&nbsp; The drive is unlocked during system startup so that the files can be accessed and used.

<p>Who doesn't understand ?</p>
<p>If I had bitlocked a fixed drive it wouldn't necessarily be unlocked on startup. That is an option. To be of any use at all it would not unlock on startup. The whole idea is to put in the code so that not just anyone can get to it !</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I have two bitlocked drives. A jump drive and a 8T external drive. They get plugged in whenever. Not necessarily at startup. The code, password, is entered once when prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases, there is no way to lock back without removal or restart. In the case of a fixed drive, it&nbsp; would be particularly annoying since it would absolutely require a reset to have it again protected with a password.</p>

<p>It's by design. As soon as you unlock it, other processes (AV, etc) can access the data, so you have to restart to ensure the nothing is using the volume.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can explicitly enter the command below (if drive is f:) but this can cause problems. It's the equivalent of pulling a USB drive without ejecting it - emergency use only.</p>

<p>That is a good and reasonable reply. I understood and understand that once released from bitlock&nbsp; it is available for applications and network attachments. I'll even go so far as to say it is a good and well integrated feature. I can understand that returning
 it to a locked state would be&nbsp; perhaps difficult to do properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't make it any less annoying though. There really should be a way to lock back a bitlocked drive, similar to the warnings and such already done for an eject. Something to put in for a future release. Hopefully not another 9 years from now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Don't really know if you are Microsoft but&nbsp;</span>I'll end with a comment. I'm impressed at even getting a reply. This forum is mostly ancient Q and A. I've been using it since the Win 10 transition and was getting a bit frustrated. I gave
 up on getting Homegroup to work correctly from an upgraded Win 7. Some other minor stuff too. Replies to existing threads get little attention. Starting a fresh one seems to get attention. I can't mark it solved but I do say thanks for replying.</p>

<p>There's some MS people here but it's mostly just a peer community of other home users (this site is entirely meant for 'average consumers', rather than IT pros or advanced users).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd ask you to put your feedback into the built-in Feedback app.&nbsp; It really does go to the teams that build the features you give feedback about.&nbsp; In fact the first whole week of March, myself and about 3000 other MVPs will be spending the week at Microsoft
 HQ in Washington state to discuss feedback and other things.&nbsp; We are your advocates there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for homegroup - don't waste your time:&nbsp; the entire feature is getting removed and will be deleted from all Windows 10 computers in a matter of weeks from now.</p>

<h2>            AutoPlay non-functional</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 PRO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoPlay isn't working in Windows 10.<br />
The SETTINGS|DEVICES menu has it turned ON.<br />
In Control Panel, it's turned on and configured to PLAY a CD.<br />
It's not disabled in the Group Policy editor.<br />
Neither of the two optical drives (a CD and DVD) will auto play either file type in Windows Media Player or MPC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An MS level I tech made this statement:</p>
<p>"For this issue you can download Windows DVD Player available in the Store. Since WMP and MPC can no longer support CD / DVD autoplay."</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I understand that there's no native DVD player in Win 10, it strikes me that auto play should function nonetheless - using the default CD or DVD app.&nbsp; Or is the Windows tech correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>act, I believe it did just that, earlier</p>
<p>Can someone confirm this, and suggest what other measures might enable AP, please.&nbsp; All forum suggestions to this date have been tried.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.<br />
I will surely help you with this.</div>
<div><br />
I need to ask you a few questions in order to assist you in a better way.</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Have you tried enabling the default settings in auto play option in the control panel?<br />
2.&nbsp;If yes please let us know what happens when you set the option to default?</div>
<div><br />
Meanwhile try the following steps and see if it works:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click <strong>Windows key +X,</strong> and then select<strong> Control Panel </strong>
Select <strong>AutoPlay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; <br />
2.&nbsp;In the list next to the device or type of disc, <strong>click Ask me every time.</strong></div>
<div><br />
Also try the following command and see if it helps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click <strong>Windows key +X</strong><strong>, </strong>and then select <strong>
Command prompt (Admin)<br />
</strong>2.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type<strong> net start shellhwdetection <br />
</strong>3.&nbsp;And then press <strong>Enter.</strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Restart your computer.</div>
<div>
<p>5.Now click<strong> Windows key&nbsp;+R</strong> ,and type <strong>services.msc </strong>
in the run command box.</p>
<p>6.Search for <strong>shell hardware detection&nbsp;</strong>in the services window&nbsp;and see if it is set to automatic&nbsp; by right clicking on the service and selecting properties.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

            <p><strong>RESOLVED via a system rebuild. No clue as to why it was failing.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>Yes, RESTORE DEFAULTS has been tested.&nbsp; This resets all to "choose a default."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Ask me every time" (for a CD, in this test) does nothing.&nbsp; No Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Shellhwdetection" responds "the requested service has already been started."</p>
<p>
</p><p>SHELL HARDWARE DETECTION is set to "automatic" and is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoPlay works fine for memory card insertion, but not for optical drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the statement that the MS Level I tech made be true:&nbsp; "For this issue you can download Windows DVD Player available in the Store. Since WMP and MPC can no longer support CD / DVD autoplay."<br />

            <p>I can confirm that autoplay doesn't work. &nbsp;I can't get my dell inspiron, which is fairly new, and working well in all other ways, to recognize my sony camera. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows instructions say the autoplay window should pop up, but it doesn't. &nbsp;I found the settings (so hard to do these day) and made sure autoplay is turned on. &nbsp;The usb connection is good, in that it is charging my camera. &nbsp;I've tried multiple cables
 and ports. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions say, if autoplay doesn't work, to connect manually by clicking start, then "computer" from the menu, however, "computer" isn't an option &nbsp;in the menu. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I look around, lost in the crazy new microsoft menu system, for anyway to see my camera, or to see a way to try to connect. &nbsp;So far, nothing. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>muopt&#61;1 endless loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            muopt&#61;1 endless loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We've been rebuilding a test server with Windows Server 2003 R2 enterprise x64 and we've run into a problem with Microsoft Update on this machine. When you go the Microsoft Update page
<a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a>&nbsp;it continually loops from "Checking to see if your computer has the latest version of windows updating software
 for use with this website" to "Checking for the latest version of Windows updating software..." And each time it loops it append &amp;muopt=1 to the end of the address. I've searched high and low and can't seem to find an answer to this one. If I go into the administrator
 settings and disable Microsoft update and use windows update it works fine. I've tried reinstalling the windows update software manually with the /wuforce command with no luck. I've also added all the Microsoft update sites to the trusted sites list. We've
 uninstalled the Internet explorer enhanced security configuration on the server and disabled windows firewall. There's also currently no virus scan loaded yet as this box is brand new. Any ideas??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hey Steve,
<div>&nbsp;I ran through all the updates on Windows Update and was then able to enable Microsoft Update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Also, check your Automatic Updates. I think this is the check that was causing the loop for me. I enabled automatic updates before enabling Microsoft Update and the first page that came up was a page informing me of the automatic update settings.</div>

<h2>            Cannot connect Canon SX610HS via WI-FI to Windows10 PC</h2>
                    I have a Netgear router connected to the internet and my PC.&nbsp; Upgraded to Windows10 earlier this year. Bought camera new in April and installed Canon Utilities&nbsp; on PC and ran Wi-Fi connection setup as per instructions. &nbsp;My camera finds my Wi-Fi network
 / access point but searches unsuccessfully for my PC ("Device Not Found").&nbsp; I have been on the phone with Canon and they can't tell me why.&nbsp; Disabled anti-virus / firewall to no avail.&nbsp; What am I missing (probably something simple / stupid)? Any ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            It's a Dell Inspiron 560 Desktop -- maybe five or six years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am under the assumption that I can transmit from my camera to my desktop through my wireless router.&nbsp; Is that not correct?&nbsp; My camera finds my router but not my desktop and my desktop
 doesn't see the camera.&nbsp; I did install Canon's software and ran their Wi-Fi connection setup on my PC.&nbsp; My router is connected to the PC but just acts as an internet&nbsp;pass-through and I don't know that that the PC even "knows"&nbsp; about the router.&nbsp; As I'm sure
 you can tell, I'm not a computer whiz.&nbsp; Any further assistance is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 7 Home Premium &#40;x64&#41; with a HP OEM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ess geeeich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 7 Home Premium &#40;x64&#41; with a HP OEM Product Key</h2>
                    Two years ago I bought an HP pre-activated PC containing Windows 7 x64 Home Premium.
<div>Some months ago it happened that the HDD got corrupted, and, trying and trying (also tried using Ubuntu's Boot CD functionalities) I found out I wasn't able to save any data, I had NTFS errors trying to read and backup data to some other CD/DVD.</div>
<div>So, I didn't have any other solution besides installing Ubuntu (Not even the Recovery partition did anything).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I'd like to know if I have a (possibly) free solution to get the same identical OS (or, at least, any of the Windows 7 64-bit OS, as I have 4GB of ram) using my Key which is right there, still on the side of my PC.</div>
<div>I know it will not work out "as is" because OEM keys aren't Windows keys.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way?</div>
<div><br />
Let me say I have no more data from the old Windows 7 installation - It is now completely formatted but I am COMPLETELY sure i wasn't able to read any kind of data from the HDD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: Oh, it was an Italian version, but getting an English one will not be big trouble.</div>

            That article links to a KB article for Windows 7 that says to press CRTL+ALT+DEL, but the issue is when you press CTRL+ALT+DEL in Windows 10, the option to change a password is not there.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: </b>Since the suggestion is to run check disk you may run the check disk and see if that helps.</p>
<p>No, check Disk won’t affect the pictures.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>However since they are already not present, you may run check disk and see if you find them.</p>
<p><span>Check Disk examines disks and can correct many types of common errors on FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS drives. One of the ways Check Disk locates errors is by comparing the volume bitmap with the disk sectors assigned to files in the file system. Check Disk
 can’t repair corrupted data within files that appear to be structurally intact, however. You can run Check Disk from the command line or through a graphical interface.</span></p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost</p>
<span>Check a drive for errors:</span>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Perform system restore and see if are able to find the pictures.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Pictures and Videos are the data files on the computer; system restore does not help in recovering the data files.</p>

            I think that you're asking how to create a <em>signature </em>for your E-mail.&nbsp; What E-mail program or web page do you use when you send messages?

<p>What specific email client software are you using?&nbsp; The answer depends entirely upon that key bit of information, which you've so carefully left out.&nbsp; I'm afraid that no one can help if you don't provide at least a modicum of pertinent information.</p>

<p>Also, please unstick your CapsLock key.&nbsp; (Or replace the defective keyboard.)&nbsp; Posting in all caps, as you have done, is the Usenet/Forum equivalent of shouting, and is considered very rude by a large number of people.&nbsp; More importantly, posting in all caps
 makes the post harder to read, further reducing your chances of getting help; a great many people won't even try to read such a message.&nbsp; (I know I won't, if it's longer than 3 or 3 lines.)&nbsp; If you really want to increase your chances of getting help, simply
 comply with the dictates of common courtesy and the conventions of the venue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the below recommended methods and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the below suggested steps to access the files and folders saved under the guest profile.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows Key + R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type ".." without the quotes into the Dialog Box which would open a file explorer with all the user profiles saved on the computer.</span></p>

<p>[Replace ‘username’ and ‘password’ with your desired username and password]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step B. Copying old files to newly created User Profile</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Go to <strong>C:\Users\(Your-Corrupted-Profile-Name)\</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Copy all files except three files : <br />
<strong>NtUser.dat<br />
NtUser.ini<br />
NtUser.log</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Go to <strong>C:\Users\(New-User-Profile-name)\</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Paste all those copied files here.</p>

</p><p>Some of those few people who have successfully activated the in-built Guest account under Win 10&nbsp;have identified the explorer.exe crash/reload loop&nbsp;(flashing screen)&nbsp;mentioned in other posts, which makes the account unusable.</p>

 back to the previous version of Windows, having taken care to back up all your data, first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated the in-built Guest account August 01, 2015, by&nbsp; following the <a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</em>from an elevated command prompt (right-click Start/Windows button and select Command Prompt (Admin)).&nbsp; Guest then appeared in the list of available accounts on the lock screen, although it came with the explorer.exe crash reload loop, thus making it unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have, in the past couple of days, activated the Guest account on two more Win 10 PCs.&nbsp; The command line echoed that this had succeeded, and Guest appears, as one of the alternatives,&nbsp;when I click on my account name at the top of the Start Menu, but when
 I select it, instead of switching to the Guest account which is not password protected, it takes me to the lock screen, where Guest is no longer shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft appear to be suppressing the Guest account, for reasons that I/we do not know.&nbsp; We should be told.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
The concensus of opinion in this forum is that it is impossible to recreate in Win 10 the Guest account of previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
The workaround is to create a local user account (you may have to Google (or Bing) how to do that), which, by definition, is not a Microsoft Account, and doesn't require an e-mail adddress, or other identity details.&nbsp; You may also have to Google/Bing how to
 retrieve any docments in your previous version of Windows Guest account, which disappeared when you upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p><br />
Name this new local user account Visitor, and create it as a Standard user, not Administrator, and you will have as close as you are going to get to the old Guest account.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Dell Backup and Recovery stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hello, to start things off I run on a XPS computer with 16 GB of ram, 1 TB of space and run on an 4th gen i7 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment i'm trying to restore my computer using Dell Backup and Recovery but the recovery has been stuck on "Backing up your data and Dell Backup and Recovery settings" for an hour and a half now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? Can I fix this without harming my computer or do I have to force a shutdown?</p>

I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if you are able to continue with the backup.<br />
<br />
If you are still not able to continue with the backup, then I would suggest you to contact dell support as you are using Dell backup and Recovery.<br />

<h2>            Cannot see any update in my &#34;View Update History&#34; and No Windows Security Update in &#34;Installed Updates&#34;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am experiencing a problem with Window Update. I cannot list any Windows Security Update in "Installed Updates" and there is no update in "View Update History". It does not give me an option to restore hidden updates.<br />
<br />
I think windows update got corrupted. I tried to run System Update Readiness Tool but it took almost 1 hour and I thought I got stuck. So I cancelled it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this problem?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate every single suggestion.<br />
<br />
Thank you

 It worked perfectly previously with smooth transitions and HD quality.&nbsp; I ugraded to Roxio NXT 4 to see if it was more compatable with Windows 10 but get the same results.&nbsp; I do not know if it is a virus or what.&nbsp; Can anyone out there help me?&nbsp; This is a wedding

    <title>Trouble calling on Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> margeryscott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble calling on Skype</h2>
                    <p>I've recently run into some problems that I never had before. Suddenly, after using Skype for years, I have to use an external headset so that the person I'm calling can hear me. I've checked all the connections and I can't find any reason why the microphone
 suddenly doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, a few weeks ago, &nbsp;when I tried to Skype a friend, it connected, but after 2-3 seconds, I got a message saying "No Answer". I tried several times, but got the same message after only one "ring". I've never had this issue before. I uninstalled the program
 and reinstalled it, but I get the same message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what's happening and how I can fix these issues?</p>

 I can skype on another computer in the house.</p>

    <title>Flash Drive - Disk in Drive X is not formatted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe 121  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash Drive - Disk in Drive X is not formatted</h2>
                    I am running Windows XP Service Pack 2.&nbsp; When I insert a flash drive, 4 different physical drives so far, and try to access the data, I get a message stating "The disk in drive 'X' is not formatted.&nbsp; Do you want to format it now.&nbsp; After answering Yes,&nbsp;and
 entering the required perameters, the system appears to start formatting, however It returns Windows was unable to complete the format.&nbsp; I can read all 4 flash drives on other XP machines with no problem.<br />
<br />
When I initially insert the drive, the message from the task bar identifies the brand of flash drive and the system sets up the drive as the next available drive letter, but without the file name.&nbsp; When I open properties, it knows nothing about capacity and
 identifies the entire drive as used space.&nbsp; The hardware tab correctly identifies the brand &amp; model of the drive and&nbsp;clicking on populate under the hardware properties returns the correct drive capacity<br />
<br />
Disk Management identifies it as a Healthy (Active) drive and shows the correct capacity, but does not give me the drive name or file system, only the letter.&nbsp; I cannot format the drive from this window either.<br />
<br />
This is consistant with all 3 USB ports on my laptop and the 3 ports on the docking station.&nbsp; I have my keyboard &amp; mouse attached through USB and I regularly attach my cell phone though the same USB port&nbsp;that I use for the flash drive<br />
<br />
I have no network drives mapped.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;change the drive letter and reinstall the device, the system remembers the new drive letter, but the symptoms remain.&nbsp; I have already installed the hotfix for the "drive masking bug".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

            I started having this on my XP Sp3 as well.<br />
All my USB flash drives and USB memory devices that are FAT32 don't work. <br />
I get the 'drive is not formatted' error message.&nbsp; All the drives/devices work on all other PC's (XP and Win7)
<br />
<br />
-finally decided to re-install XP and that didn't help at all.<br />
-trying to re-format doesn't work either (FAT and NTFS), DOS/.Disk manager or otherwise.<br />
<br />
The problem is not the drives. <br />

<h2>            clean windows 7 installation error&#58; Windows could not set the offline locale information</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, so i've seen many of these problems online and just not sure if i also got the exact same problem.</p>
<p>i have a Fujitsu Siemens Scaleo Pi</p>
<p>it had Vista Home Premiume pre-installed</p>
<p>the windows vista was corrupted so i went and bought a windows 7 professional disk</p>
<p>so i whiped out the HHD (Western Digital 250GB)</p>
<p>the installation went as far as 99% and then a error message popped out "<span>0x80FE0000"</span></p>
<p>"Windows could not set the offline locale information"</p>
<p>so i tried re-installing Vista and the same problem occured.</p>
<p>but when i changed the HHD it installed. i took this HHD from one of my old laptop.</p>
<p>what i dont understand is that before i whiped out the HHD, Vista was operating but i wanted to re-install</p>
<p>becasue my PC was becoming extremely slow.</p>
<p>i am 100% sure that the HHD still works, i have a feeling that its just a setting thats wrong, should i add a jumper to the HHD maybe?</p>
<p>if there is a certain way the partitions should be or no partitions at all how should i do it?? please help ASAP.</p>
<p>im dead meat if i dont get this PC up and running &lt;3</p>

            <p>This DLL isn't part of Windows. Rerun the game's setup program to see if it reinstalls all components necessary for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a game requires any DLL that is not part of the operating system then the game developer should add the DLL in the setup program. Failing to do so is the developer's fault (the fact that the game won't run on a clean system is a bug that nobody should
 ignore before publishing).</p>

TatianaRichie,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no longer an option to create an account using your preferred Skype name. We have changed the way that you create a new account to use with Skype. This means that you can create a new account using either an email address or a phone number. This
 is the information you hand out when you want to be found and added on Skype. For all intents and purposes this will now be your Skype account name. You can set up your Skype display name that your contacts see in their contact list or when someone searches
 for you by editing your profile. I sent you a Private message to better assist you with your concern, please check your Messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
