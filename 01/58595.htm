            Hi ediegelman,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
HyperTerminal isn't included in this version of Windows. There are several options which are discussed in the below article.<br />

Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<p>Remove all USB devices, especially a USB receiver for a wireless mouse or keyboard</p>
<p>Start your system again and see if it boots into Windows, if needs be, give it up to 20 minutes to see if the update finishes</p>

</p><p>If you have no success booting into Windows after 20 minutes or so, perform a hard shut down again and try to get into the Windows Recovery Environment:</p>

On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />

If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart<br />
Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode<br />
Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup<br />
Uninstall the app you installed that caused this issue<br />

    <title>Solution for Windows 10 WiFi Problem&#58; Buying a New WiFi USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdwpsyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solution for Windows 10 WiFi Problem&#58; Buying a New WiFi USB Adapter</h2>
                    <p>This solution will not be for everyone, but after wasting 20 hours over the course of a week trying to fix the Windows 10 WiFi problem, I gave in and bought a new WiFi USB Adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there are other good brands, but the one I bought from Best Buy,&nbsp;Netgear AC1200 High Gain WiFi USB Adapter, is working great and Internet speed is much faster.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to download the latest version of the software, I think because the version that came with the CD was not compatible with Windows 10. That part was tricky because my Internet connection was lasting only 10 minutes or so and it was very slow (because
 of the Windows 10 problem). So I had to try downloading the drivers for the adapter four times before it worked. [You could also download it to another computer and put it on a flash drive and then install on your Windows-10-plagued PC.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to go this route, be sure to purchase a USB Adapter that is compatible with your router, i.e., 802.11ac, 802.11n, or 802.11g. I found a good article that explains how to determine your router type:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.howtogeek.com/208352/upgrade-your-wireless-router-to-get-faster-speeds-and-more-reliable-wi-fi/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Mail, multiple email addresses, and default &#34;from&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonklaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Mail, multiple email addresses, and default &#34;from&#34; field</h2>
                    Dear community,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a problem whose solution is probably really simple, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to use Windows 8.1 mail as my default client. I use multiple email addresses, all accessed through a single GMail account (either via forwarding or by allowing GMail to access POP.) But no matter the address the sender uses, I always reply from
 one single address, which happens to be a different address from my GMail account that serves as my main inbox. Is it possible in Windows 8.1 mail to specify a default "From" field?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since I'm not expressing this clearly, here's an example (these are not real email addresses):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** = the address where all my mail is forwarded/fetched&nbsp;</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** = secondary incoming address</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;= tertiary incoming address</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy **** = the address that I would like my mail to come from, no matter what email address the sender has used</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope that makes sense!</div>
<div><br />

<p>Are you trying to&nbsp;keep one particular email ID as default for the multiple email accounts that you have?</p>

            Thanks, Geethu. I did find a workaround, though.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Instead of setting up my account via the preset Google Account method, I clicked "other account" and then specified that I was setting up an IMAP account. From there, I was successful in manually setting my email address (@uchicago.edu), my username (@gmail.com),
 and password for incoming mail. For outgoing mail, I just log in directly to the uchicago.edu SMTP servers with a different username and password. A complicated setup, but works fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In summary: All of my mail (from several different servers and old addresses) is routed to a single GMail account. Then, to a recipient, my mail comes from an email address at uchicago.edu. And no matter whether I have received mail from that address or
 from one of my older addresses, this is the address that the recipient sees.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My only complaint is that Windows 8.1 made me click "see more options" lots of times in order to be able to do this. But I understand that this layout automates and simplifies setup for most people.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again,</div>
<div>Jonathan</div>

<div>I do, actually, use Postbox, which integrates nicely with GMail. But Postbox is now out of development, and I'm aware that at some point it's going to be unusable. I really sort of like Windows 8 mail, particularly in comparison with Thunderbird, which
 in its current iteration doesn't handle GMail's threading style very well (especially with sent messages). And Outlook has never "done it" for me . . .</div>

            <p>This is a real pain in Windows 8.1 Mail. There is no way to change settings for default-account, in my case aol.com. I have used aol by Thunderbird for ages, and it has been quite easy. With Win 8.1 Mail it is impossible, because i cannot change settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My case is, that i have to use internetproviders own server to send messages, not aol-server. I have to manually change outgoing server to another, but in Win 8.1 it is impossible when account is default account. So i can get email, but cannot send from
 default account.</p>

<h2>            OPEN NAT Still can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get a teredo ip adress.</h2>
                    
<p>Everything worked fine until a couple days ago.</p>

<p>I've changed nothing on my network but now i can't join any Party chats. I can join games and parties fine but am unable to join party chat with anyone in any party. None of my network settings changes, this happened out of the blue.</p>

<p>My NAT still shows as open On the network settings page of the Xbox one but when running a "test multiplayer connection" I get "Cant get a Teredo Ip adress".</p>
<p>In Detailed Network statistics, under "Detailed NAT information" it says "Your network is behind a firewall (or not connected) Which makes no sense seeing as i Turned my Router's Firewall off.</p>

<p>I have UPNP enabled and tried disabling ipv6 but still to no avail.</p>

<p>I was having the exact same issue that started a few days ago. I tried everything, UPnP, Port Forwarding, Port Triggering, DMZ. After a full day yesterday of trying to figure this out I found a solution that worked, for me at least.</p>
<p>One the XB1 I went to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;Alternate MAC Address&gt;Clear</p>
<p>Once I selected this option the XB1 will need to be restarted. It does this automatically and does take a few minutes to boot. Once it was back on and signed in I just went straight to the XB1 settings again without touching any LAN/WAN settings. I selected
 the "Test Multiplayer Connection" and it resolved with no further Teredo IP error message. Thankfully a "It's All Good" message appeared instead.</p>
<p>This worked for me, hope it helps.</p>

<p>I got the "can't get a Teredo IP address" error for the first time today. It happened when I tried connecting my X1 to my 2.4 GHz network. As soon as I connected it to the 5 GHz one again, I never got the error.</p>
<p>The wireless / internet feature of the X1 is very finicky.</p>

I have just about had enough of trying to figure this system out.&nbsp; When I type in a contact, it also includes a second one and won't let me&nbsp; delete it, only both of none.

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You could use a spam filter.
<br />What email application are you using to read your emails?

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It seems like your email address somehow got compromised and even opting out is not removing the address from those mailing lists. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to spend some time marking some of these messages as Junk Mail or create a new user account and share it only with trusted contacts. 
<br />
<br />Its also possible one of your contacts might have a compromised account, which is how you ended up getting added to those mailing list.

            Hi robertgrudzinski 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You will have to block sender at the source of your mail provider. Hence, if you are using, for example, Gmail, you will need to login to Gmail and mark this sender as spam.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hello, RobertGrudzinski,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Which email client are you using? MS Office 365, Outlook.com, Thunderbird??
<br />
<br />1. Change the level of protection in the Junk Email Filter
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-level-of-protection-in-the-junk-email-filter-e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try using Sweep to get rid of the emails

<br />
<br />3. Use Inbox Rules in Outlook.com

            Often all the opt-out email link does is confirm there is an active email address so it’s not recommended to click on any unsubscribe link.
<br />You will have to block the emails with a filter - if the emails all come from the same domain &amp; it is unique this is easy, just choose to block all emails coming from whatever is after the @, this gets tricky if the domain isn’t unique as it’s from Yahoo, Gmail or Hotmail/Outlook as blocking these this way will also block genuine emails.
<br />Usually you would just mark the sender as spam but this often takes a few emails marked before it’s blocked.
<br />I would consider Mailwasher: <a href="https://www.mailwasher.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mailwasher.net/</a> you use this to check your emails &amp; ‘wash’/remove any junk mail before it’s downloaded to your mail app.

<h2>            Can I recover a note from Notepad that I lost when Windows updated&#63;</h2>
                    I just lost an important note in Notepad when Windows did a HUGE AND LONG update! Can I get it back? Why in the world is there not an autorecover feature in Notepad?!

            You can via windows.old 
<br />
<br />Look for Windows.old in your C: drive at the bottom of the files/folders there (or wherever windows is located on your PC)
<br />
<br />When you get into it, find where the notepad document was originally and just pull it out of windows.old. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If not you may have to use a recovery state that you hopefully saved before the update.
<br />
<br />Always remember to back up important files!

<p>I found "Windows.old&gt; WINDOWS&gt; notepad" but it just opens the application. <br />
I did a search for .txt documents, but didn't find it there, either. The note was still in progress, and I do not recall if I had done a save on it at that point or not. Apparently not.

            What i meant was to find the specific notepad you created not the actual app. 
<br />
<br />Where did you save the notepad originally?

            As noted above, I don't remember if I had saved it at all at that point, as I was still working on it. All the apps and programs like this on my Mac either save automatically periodically or have an auto-recovery feature so if something happens you only
 lose a few minutes of work, not the entire work itself. <br />
<br />
As noted, I tried doing a .txt search but only got a bunch of computer-generated logs. Nothing labeled "untitled" like I would normally expect.

            If you never saved the notepad, then you'd be out of luck with even a recovery as Windows does not auto save notepad entries. If you ever closed out of the notepad you were writing then you were prompted to save it. Did that ever happen?

            It happened during a software update; it was open in the background when the software update started, so I'm not sure if there was a dialog box or not. When I came back to my computer it was in the middle of a very long update...<br />
<br />
I presume since it was not found under any of the .txt items that it was not saved.

            Yes. If you did not ever save it, then the surprise update probably shut it down and did not save it. If all you did was open a new notepad and write stuff in it but never save it then it is probably gone.
<br />
<br />For that, I apologize. :(

<h2>            My surname does not appear anywhere in my Skype Profile but is used by Skype Translator</h2>
                    My surname does not appear anywhere in my Skype Profile but is used by Skype Translator on Skype for Web and IOS.<br />
So where is Skype Translator getting my surname from.... and why is it being used?<br />
<br />
The only place I can find my surname being used within Skype is for billing.<br />
What is going on?<br />
<br />
I can also see the name of others I chat to which is not their Skype Name. This seems to be a severe privacy breach. Am I missing something?

<p>Also... Just before this.... And this may be completely separate or related.... A few minutes before I turned Skype Translator on for the first time, I received simultaneous notifications for a non-translator chat (ie. me and one other skype user) on my
 iPhone and iPad. The iPhone notification showed the Skype Name of the other user (as shown in their Skype profile) whereas the iPad notification showed a name I had not seen before.... and doesn't appear in their Skype profile.<br />
<br />
The unknown name in the iPad notification is the same name used by Skype Translator so where is this coming from? Billing info?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for iPhone app v8.10.1<br />
Skype for iPad app v6.35.1</p>

<p><strong>This has been very frustrating for the past 2 or 3 weeks. When i play black ops, i will be about half way through a game and it will show the disconnecting icon (Ethernet cable being pulled out) and then it will take me back to the lobby but then
 it will say game lobby closed. I then can go to my recent players list and see that they are still playing on the same game. I would says this happens 4 out of 5 games. When I play fifa 11 at night, I will be in a party with some guys and we will be playing
 a "pro clubs" match and it will just randomly say "lost connection to host. this game session has ended" and take me back to the main page. it also kicks me out of the XBL party. At first I though it could have been my Ethernet cable, but then the other night
 I was video chatting on my macbook using the wireless and we kept getting disconnected at the exact same time as when i would get kicked from a Black ops game. This leads me to believe that it is the actually internet or something of that nature. Any help

<p>Have you contacted Comcast yet? You have done the troubleshooting there to determine it is more than xbox live, since your Macbook got disconnected - it will then be related to your internet connection or your home networking equipment.
</p>
<p>You may want to plug directly into your cable modem instead of to your router, if you still get disconnected from xbox live then you'll want to have Comcast take a look at the signal, maybe even have them swap out your cable modem. If you're not getting
 disconnected when plugged directly into your cable modem then most likely your WRT54G is having the issue, which is kind of an older router - I had the WRT54G V8 for several years before I replaced it this past January, so the V4 is possibly at a point of
 failure.</p>

<h3> magicman2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data transfer from old Xbox 360 to new Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new Xbox 360 and I tried transferring all of my data from my old Xbox 360 to the new one. I configured a USB flash drive, transferred my content onto the flash drive from the old Xbox 360 (without any problems) and when I attempt to transfer
 the content from the USB flash drive to the new Xbox 360 it errors out saying it cannot continue and does not give me a code. I have gone through each item individually on my flash drive trying to copy/transfer them to the new Xbox 360 and I would estimate
 about 30% or so of the data will transfer while the rest errors out. Has anyone else had this issue? How can I get all of my data onto the new Xbox?</p>
<p>I was considering transferring everything back to the old Xbox and then buying a transfer cable and trying that route but if I can somehow make it work without having to spend that extra $15 I would prefer it. If this is what I have to do then I will do
 it.</p>

<p>You could simply move your saved games over to the cloud (if available) or to the usb drive and simply redownload the rest on the new console. All the data is still attached to your profile and even the licenses can be transferred so no extra work needed
 there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure to try it out with the new console before committing. Download some DLC or something from the new console to the replacement USB MU and make sure it works.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.&nbsp; Unfortunately a lot of registry cleaners can end up doing more harm than good.&nbsp; I would verify with the registry program you have to see if it created any type of original backup before it started. &nbsp;Now
 when you say that you "reset the registry to an older date" did you do this through System Restore?&nbsp; If not then I would suggest running a System Restore to a date prior to the registry "cleaning."&nbsp; If that does not correct the issue then you may need to do
 a repair install.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi Crom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using the <strong>Administrator account</strong> on your <strong>Windows 10
</strong>computer, you will have a full control over your device. You are able to install some programs and make changes on your computer, and grant permission for any system changes. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you change the account type of
 the user account on your computer to <strong>Administrator</strong> from the <strong>
Settings</strong>. To do this, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Family &amp; other people</strong>.</li><li>Select the account that you are using and click the <strong>Change account type</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Administrator</strong> by click the menu box under
<strong>Change account type</strong> window and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once you’re done, restart your computer and then check if you’re able to change the account type of your user account properly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about your concern for additional assistance.<br />

            I think I found out the fix. From Start, type "advanced system settings", choose "View advanced system settings", open "Performance" settings and make sure you have "Animate controls and elements inside windows" option enabled. I had my desktop PC in "performance
 mode" which disabled this option. Turn it on and restart Skype to get emoticon animation working.

            I'm afraid not, it was removed a long time ago so I don't see it coming back anytime soon, maybe with the new xbox.

    <title>Xbox One game audio extremely low when on parry chat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One game audio extremely low when on parry chat</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I know there are a few posts about how the game audio is low when in party chat, and everyone just says go to the audio settings and move the little bar more over to the game audio instead of parry chat audio. Well I've done that and I still can barley hear the games. I'm talking the audio is so low I can even hear gunfire in shooter games. I've already turned the volume up all the way in the game menu and on the audio menu where you can control to either hear the game more or the party chat I have the little bar moved all the way to the left and I still can't hear the game. Is there anyone who has had the issue and got it resolved?</p>
