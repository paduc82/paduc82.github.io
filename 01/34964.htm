<h2>            Only 2.43 GB are usable out of 4.00 GB RAM Memory</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G510 Laptop with 4 GB RAM Memory and Intel i5 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I've checked in the computer properties, I found out these things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4200M CPU @ 2.50 GHz 2.50 GHz</p>
<p>Installed Memory (RAM): 4.00 GB (2.43 GB are usable)</p>
<p>Operating System: 32bit OS, x64 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do in order to use all of the 4 GB RAM and not only 2.43 GB? My computer is very slow because of it...</p>

            <p>32 bit can only see ~3.25Gb no matter how much you have installed.&nbsp; The remaining 500Mb is probably shared video memory.&nbsp; In any case it is not why your computer is running slower than normal.&nbsp; The only way you can use all 4 gigs is to re-install 64 bit

<h2>            New Xbox One X - Flickering Confetti Screen in Game only</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my Xbox one x that I bought in November 2017 died on me. I probably had 1500 hours on this device. I was running a blu-ray disc for about 5 minutes after getting home when it seamingly overheated and shutoff. The device would not turn back on.
 I was using the device memory in conjunction with a 2TB Seagate External Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acer 4k 28" monitor at 60Hz frame cap</li><li>Monster 4k HD 4' cable</li><li>Wired ethernet connection</li><li>Astro A50 using the optical audio out</li><li>Vertical Cooling stand</li><li>Usually using a usb keyboard plugged in as well</li><li>Seagate 2 TB external Drive</li></ul>
<p>Here's the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day after I setup my xbox, I loaded up 2 different games - Apex Legends and Rocket League. I noticed after a couple minutes in the Main Menu that there was a "flickering confetti rain" graphic across the screen. At first I wasn't sure if this was a new
 seasonal update or something. It worsened into bright Pink Spots and Lines coming across the screen - However, when I hit the home button and go through the menus to try and solve this, the flickering is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is leading me to believe that I'm having an issue with 4K optimization. I'm thinking I could be having an issue with the external drive not saving extra data for 4K optimized games. The picture is flawless when scrolling through the home screen and
 menus, but as soon as I load up a game "optimized for 4K", i seem to get issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did go through the video settings and tried what I thought seemed to be every combination of settings changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already formatted the external drive and will re-download games as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just kind of lost at this point because it seems like my console isn't letting me access some settings. color depth is stuck at 8 bit (24 bits per pixel) and I think it's supposed to be at 10 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on this issue? again I'm thinking the issue lies with some information loss from the old console not being present in the new one - giving me issues trying to play 4k optimized games but not having the extra file downloads for those 4k games.
 ( the download sizes seemed small to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if my thoughts are scattered. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>When I got my Xbox One X a few weeks ago I didn't transfer any data from my old console. It took a long time to set up the new console, however the downloads on the One X seem to be the same size or smaller than my previous Xbox One as the One X will only
 download the 4K assets. That's because games will only run in 4K and then the console will scale them down to a lower resolution if you aren't using a 4K display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the artefacts when playing games I would imagine that it's probably heat related, I keep my One X in a TV cabinet with an open front and the shelf allows for plenty of space at the sides and back of the console. I would look at where the console is
 placed and put it in a horizontal position as the vents are in the side and back, especially as it shut off when playing a Blu-Ray disk which shouldn't be overheating the console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I disagree on a couple points here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I mentioned I'm now using a vertical stand that has 3 fans built in. This allows for more surface area being exposed to ambient room temperature as well as 3 extra cooling fans on the right side. To say I'm seeing artefacts due to heat is silly since
 the artefacts disappear immediately when I exit game and browse any menu or settings page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd, I don't think that's entirely accurate about the smaller file sizes for 4k. For example, with fallout 4 I'm certain that they released extra download files to support 4k optimization on top of the base game. 4k games will always be bigger. It's simply
 much more information. Any 4k assets will be bigger than their 1080p counterparts so I'm not sure what kind of argument that is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft specifically states that you shouldn't use the One X in a vertical orientation as you have vents on both sides of the console and that WILL restrict airflow and no cooling stand will change that, running games will heat up the console which is
 why when the console overheats you will see artefacts on screen. Consider the fact that you also state that "I was running a blu-ray disc for about 5 minutes after getting home when it seamingly overheated and shutoff. The device would not turn back on." and
 that tells me you have an airflow issue. It's the same thing I see on PC's with inadequate cooling under load.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean, if you block vents on a console or a PC then it will overheat as you either have restricted cooling or nowhere to vent the heat. OP states that they are using the One X in a vertical orientation with a cooling stand which
 will restrict the intake of air and cause the console to overheat.</p>

<p>For any problems with Toshiba's Recovery Process, contact Toshiba at above link.</p>
<p>It is their Recovery Process, not Microsoft's.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery, if you do wish to save anthing:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download/Save the above Knoppix Live CD ISO file.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            how to hook up motorola cable modem and belkin wireless router to windows 7</h2>
                    it says the Motorola surfboard sb5101cable&nbsp; modem drivers are not compatible with windows 7, which i just started using.&nbsp; prior with windows xp i had Motorola hooked up and a Belkin g+&nbsp; wireless router model: F5d9231-4, so i could get wireless to laptops.
 Now i get the internet fine, i think&nbsp; thru Motorola, even though it says there is a problem with the driver. But there is no 'wireless' light on, on the Belkin. and no wireless&nbsp; internet for the laptops.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I am no genius when it comes to the cables, how do i connect them properly to get my prior connections,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I unhooked the all cables from wireless Belkin and unhooked the usb from the cable modem to the computer and hooked the Ethernet cable&nbsp; from the modem to the Ethernet port on the computer and we are working fine with this.&nbsp; now how do i hook up the wireless?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When you set up the connection as wireless, were you able to detect the wireless connection on the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Were you able to use the internet wirelessly using the Belkin at least once?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<h2>            Password incorrect</h2>
                    So I've been trying to log in to my microsoft account on pc (windows 10) for about 8 hours now. It tells me that my microsoft password is wrong (which it is not, because I can easily log in via my phone). So I've changed the password 8 times now with changes
 in how I change it and how long I wait till I try it again. All attempts without success. However I still manage to log in with every password via my mobile phone.

<p>Nothing you suggest works and following your directions to open a command prompt, my PC will not allow me to access the command prompt with out signing in to my Microsoft acct for which it is not recognizing my pin or my password or any password I have ever
 used for that matter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Microsoft sell me an os that keeps me from using my PC. I've logged in for 2 years with no problem and out of the blue this happens and nowhere can I find information to correct the problem that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to buy a new hard drive and then another Win 10 OS to install on it to use my computer? Aha, now I see why Microsoft might sabotage it's own operating system. Is this their version of ransomware?</p>

<h2>            My PC wont install past Windows 10 version 10.0.14393.0</h2>
                    <p>First off. My PC specs : <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC Specs</a>. I have been trying to install the latest of windows updates to my PC and at about 75% it restarts. But instead of coming back to the updating screen it just freezes up. ALT+CTRL+DEL does nothing. Its really stuck. So I have to reset it with the
 power button. It'll then come back as normal to the upgrading screen and gets to 81%. Then it freezes again... and once again its frozen and ALT+CTRL+DEL does nothing to bring up any menus. So I again use the power button to restart Windows only to see that
 its now reverting back to an older build version. So really I seem to be stuck in some endless, Godawful!, Windows update loop. Where is XP when I need it!<br />
<br />
Now. Over the past week I have been reading and trying various forms of troubleshooting myself to try and resolve the issue. The first obvious thing I tried was the Troubleshooter. I ran it, said the problem was fixed. So did a restart. Same issue happened.
 So then I tried to troubleshoot the windows updater itself and got this..&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/cSyzP9b.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooting Failed</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next I tried to run a SFC scan (in administrative mode) and showed nothing found.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/TKCgFqv.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC Scan Results</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried a DISM scan (in administrative mode) and again. Nothing found.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/21RhWoz.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DISM Results</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only thing I know left to do is to reset Windows Update components in the registry which I found in this guide
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset Windows Update components</a>. Which I do NOT want to do as I have no other way to back it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, if anyone can help me to avoid this last step. I would very much appreciate it.</p>

            One of the posts near the bottom of the first page mentions the "Apple iPhone" name but not a solution.&nbsp; The second page of the same link has several sets of directions for using regedit to fix the name problems.&nbsp; I'm not sure I would do that, especially
 if the name really isn't causing any problems.&nbsp; Sounds like some of the posters are waiting for a future iOS release from Apple to fix this. &nbsp; If you do decide to use regedit, be sure to do a backup first (File menu &gt; Export in regedit).&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 starter doesn&#39;t recognize HP LaserJet 1536 dnf printer</h2>
                    I am using Acer Aspire one 521 netbook, with pre-installed windows 7 starter (it was bought with Win 7 starter). I have HP LaserJet 1536dnf printer. I did install it, it worked fine, but anytime I unplug the usb cable from my netbook and plug it back,
 windows doesn't recognize the printer (but oddly enough, regognizes the scanner). So is there any chance that I don't have to install/uninstall the printer everytime I plug/unplug the printer?

            Hi Rohit, <br />
thanks for your reply.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Update - after reinstalling it yesterday (it worked fine even after restarting windows), it turns out, there is a problem not even with plug/ungplug, but also with shuting down the windows.<br />
<br />
The Method 2 did the trick, thank you! I still don't get what the problem is (I'll dare to say was), as the driver was installed and worked fine yesterday.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you for your help and I hope this one is solved!

<p>they could not even give it the correct name Maliwan Plague, the Crux title can get it confused with the other Crux weapon by S&amp;S, this is a reason why Maliwan and S&amp;S lost that the game makers could not even get their own titles correct. Like the S&amp;S Draco,
 does not have the correct name and looks like a Glorious Massacre that some weapon hunters will over look.</p>

<p>I think he used google translate. It would explain the misspelled German words. Little tip, you can use google translate to get an idea of what is said, but don't use it to translate big pieces of text and expect it to make sense. Especially not if you can't
 spell in your own language.</p>

            Hi Henry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the touchpad driver software from the HP Support Downloads webpage for your full model or Serial Number here:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>.  Compare with the driver presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, 
<br />
<br />Also in Device Manager, on Touchpad Driver tab, select Roll back, or if that's not available choose Uninstall driver, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Then adjust settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad and also in Additional Options link to box which will install a special tab for touchpad software.
<br />
<br />Compare if this happens with a mouse.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Henry ,
<br />
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor
<br />
<br />Follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Click on Start, select "Settings" and then click on "Control Panel".
<br />
<br />Step 2: Double click on the icon called "Mouse".
<br />
<br />Step 3: Select the properties tab of the touch panel. The name of this tab varies depending on the manufacturer of your computer, your version of the operating system and the drivers installed on the machine. Common names are "Touchpad", "Device Settings" and "Touchpad". If you do not see this option, you may not be able to activate the scroll bar on your laptop. Skip the following steps and go to the "Warnings" section below.
<br />
<br />Step 4: Click on "Settings" in the Properties menu of the touch panel and look for the section called "Scrollbar Configuration" or something similar. Activate the scroll bars within this section and define other settings, such as the width of the zone of the bars and the speed of movement.
<br />
<br />Step 5: Click "OK" to confirm your changes and then close the Control Panel window that you opened in the previous steps. The scroll bar on your laptop is now activated.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

<h3> sipuli91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst checkpoints ever &#38;gt&#59;.&#38;lt&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously, first I get a checkpoint in front of a sentry gun. That was okay-ish, I could still make it to cover if the enemies chose to stay in cover a bit longer. But then, that Afghanistan mission with those horses and choppers. Took out a chopper, got
 killed by the other, spawned, killed byt the other, spawned, killed by the other, spawned... Wow, what the qwerty were they thinking when they decided to add that checkpoint right after you take out the other chopper?? So I did some research and it seems like
 a) I'm not the only one to get frustrated with this specific checkpoint and b) it won't get any better with the later missions. I've done all the other CoDs on veteran since CoD4 and those checkpoints were all so smooth. Or I got lucky with those games but
 then again, never heard of others complaining about the checkpoints in those games. Meh. Anyone else got an opinion on the checkpoints on BO2? WILL it get better? Right now I'm about to just ignore the campaign completely. It's been really easy even on veteran
 but I've always hated spawn killing...</p>

<p>Worst checkpoints ever??Did you ever play CoD 4??I had to re-do the last mission over and over just because the checkpoints did'nt even happen 9 times out of 10.This campaign is easy on vet.</p>

<p>^I never had any problems with CoD4 and I clearly state that I've been playing them through since 4. All I know is that people cry about the "checkpoints not happening in No fighting in the War Room, boohoo, it's a glitch!!" when it's not and it's all time
 based. At least that game protected you from crap and having to restart the mission because of lack of time.</p>

<p>^"It's been really easy even on veteran but I've always hated spawn killing..." It's a complaint against the checkpoint system which led to me being spawn trapped thus forcing me to restart the whole mission and at no point did I say the campaign is difficult.
 It's not. This time you can literally stand still and slowly pick your targets on veteran. Talk about a game for casuals...</p>

<h2>            December game pass goals</h2>
                    <p>This month, in order to complete the Game Pass Goals, a player must play a Game Pass game for at least 30 minutes&nbsp;on 5, 15, or 25 days. If I already own a game in the Game Pass catalogue, e.g. Halo 5, would playing this game still count towards the goal? Or do I have to play games from the catalogue that I do not currently own?</p>

            <p>Yup!&nbsp;Any game that is included in the Xbox Game Pass subscription will count. If it helps ease any concern, try launching the game from the Xbox Game Pass tab in 'My games &amp; apps'.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hello All, my comment is directly related to the Every Day is a Game Pass Day Contest for December 2017. I spent every day this month with 1 or 2 exceptions, in a Game Pass Title to make sure that I played 25 days, so that I may be entered for a chance to win the Ultimate Prize, a 24K Gold XBox One X Scorpio Edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, this was all to no avail, as I went in to play a title tonight and ensure that I had played plenty of days and plenty of time, but my subscription was suddenly inactive. I knew I had seen the charge come out of my account around Christmas, so I double checked. Sure enough, at 1:36 AM on 12/25/2017 Game Pass showed a completed transaction for the amount of the subscription. So, I checked my account on <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com</a> and found that my Game Pass Subscription was pending. Being New Years Eve, I couldn't raise anyone by phone, but was able to contact a couple of reps through online chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The long and the short of my entire disappointing conversation with 2 different reps. Was an apology and an offer to refund my $10.65. This is an outrage, and I also wonder if it isn't their way of making sure there aren't too many people in the contest for the Grand Prize. As it stands now, I have spent days and hours in games to be entered into the contest, and Microsoft Screwed me...&nbsp;</p>
