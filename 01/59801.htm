<h2>            Windows 10 critical process died bsod</h2>
                    I'm having this problem that is becoming a nightmare. I upgraded my laptop (dell inspiron 5537 i7) to window 10 pro 64bit and after that did clean installation. It worked fine until yesterday when it got frozen while using it. I tried to restart but it
 wasn't responding so I removed the battery, pressed and held the power button for 30sec and after that inserted the battery. I turned it on and got bsod critical process died. I tried everything read on this community but the system could not log on. I tried
 to do clean installation but it got stuck at the dell logo and wouldn't even boot from the USB flash drive. I changed the hard disk with brand new one and did installation again. this time I was able to install but after installation when the PC restarted,
 this bsod critical process died again and the system can't log on. I've tried all possible suggested solutions but to no avail. I've done several reinstallation and they all installed fine but after installation when the system rest

            <p>Ok thank you and this is the link to the DMP files but the problem is that I couldnt boot into safe mode. I kept on getting the BSOD so i removed the hard drive and put it in an external hard drive case and access the folder from the external drive. I therefore
 couldnt get the msinfo file since i didnt get access into the laptop in question. but all I can say about the system is that its a Dell inspiron 5537 laptop, intel core i7 dual core processor with 1.8ghz speed, 8GB RAM, 15.6" non-touch screen, made in mid
 2013. </p>

            <p>Yes I tried to repair using the windows 10 bootable flash drive but that didnt work. I decided to clean install windows 8.1 to see if the problem will come again and surprisingly it installed and running with no issues but I dont want to use windows 8.1.
 I prefer the windows 10 so please what should I do now that windows 8.1 is running without problems mean the problem is not hardware is I guess.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Secondly now that I have done clean install of windows 8.1, will I lose my windows 10 license? because I was running windows 8.1; then upgraded to windows 10 and later did clean install of windows 10 but even that was on the corrupted hard drive. so with
 this new hard drive, how can I get back my windows 10 free license and also what should I do to get the windows 10 installed successfully?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Updates absolutely hate drop outs and this can cause minor corruptions or glitches. &nbsp;Not generally scratchy sounds.</p>
<p>The question would be how old the hard drive is and whether it is original or after market. &nbsp;Either way some HDD can start to fail and this freezes the system - black screen, menu freezes etc. &nbsp;As your console is working with the other drive I'd say it is
 your HDD failing.</p>
<p>If you can get the drive going you can try cleaning the drive. &nbsp;Otherwise I would recommend trying to salvage the data by connecting the drive to another computer and saving it OR transfer the data to a USB stick temporarily. - then get a new HDD, format
 it in the console and try and return the data to it.</p>
<p>Cleaning options - you can remove the part of deleting and re-downloading the profile.</p>
<p>1. Remove profile - SETTINGS page (far right from home page), select STORAGE, then find your profile and remove.</p>
<p>2. While in your hard drive under GAMES &amp; APPS look for any red or yellow icons with incomplete or unknown. &nbsp;Delete them. &nbsp;(This may include the game you are trying to fix)</p>
<p>3. Clear System Cache - SETTINGS page, select STORAGE and highlight a drive but don't select it. &nbsp;Press Y and select Clear System Cache. &nbsp;Agree when asked.</p>
<p>4. Be Patient - turn your console off for a full minute. &nbsp;This assists in resetting the console.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the console and download your profile - it is the icon next to 'create a profile'.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;As was stated above, the issue could have been lying with the console's hard drive prior to the update. &nbsp;Which type of console do you have (FAT, S or E) and what size hard drive was it?</p>
<p>Was the hard drive purchased with the console or separately? &nbsp;If separately, where was it purchased?</p>

            <p>Actually you cannot store the data on a pc. &nbsp;That will ruin the save data and make it unretreivable. &nbsp;I believe that the hard drive has died and that you would need to purchase a new one. &nbsp;What I would recommend is head to your local gaming store to purchase a new drive along with an official Xbox transfer cable. &nbsp;If the data is still recoverable from the drive using that would be your best bet.</p>

<h2>            Recent Windows 10 update completely bricked my PC</h2>
                    I have an Acer Spin 3 running Windows 10. &nbsp;Last night, it downloaded a recent update, and now I can't boot into Windows at all. &nbsp;I try booting, and it goes into an "Automatic Repair" attempt. &nbsp;It then asks me to restart. &nbsp;I try it, and end up going around
 in circles. &nbsp;None of the other "advanced options" appear to have worked. &nbsp;I can't even boot into Safe Mode, the attempt only giving me a BSOD. &nbsp;I don't have any System Restore points, and the Command Prompt didn't help me either. &nbsp;How am I supposed to get
 Windows working again?

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />That would be the best option, if it is available . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 latest update, shows a &#34;Inaccessible_Boot_Device&#34; BSOD error at boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why the latest Windows 10 update is breaking my machines. I finally decided to apply the Windows 10 updates (creators and anything that came out after Monday last week). Once each (previously with working copy of Windows 10) computer was done with
 the updates, I rebooted only to find the BSOD error "Inaccessible_Boot_Device". The windows boot manager allows me to launch the cmd console but safe mode is not working either. So far I've tried doing the following steps:<br />
<br />
Chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Tried using Hirens MBR tools</p>
<p>Checked the Boot files</p>
<p>Removed kb noted on sysinfo using cmd although it doesn't look like that was the latest update KB3176935</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to be fine but none of the computers is responding to anything at the moment. Any idea on what happened?</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth not functioning</h2>
                    I had tried to connect my Nokia phone with my laptop via Bluetooth , but the computer couldn't detect any device. I checked my Bluetooth settings and found Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. Even I updated the driver software but couldn't connect my phone
 via Bluetooth.

    <title>Windows Update and Microsoft Store port number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exsharaen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update and Microsoft Store port number</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering what the port numbers for Windows Update and Microsoft Store in Windows 10 are. My work computer is connected to the Internet behind a proxy, and my PC always fails to update via Windows Update, even when I check it manually. I can open Microsoft
 Store and it works normally (I can browse the Store), but I cannot update any installed apps, even when I force-check for updates. The proxy is already set via Windows Settings and works as intended for everything else (Edge, Chrome, etc.). I ask my network
 administrator about this problem, but he requires me to provide him the exact port numbers for Windows Update and Microsoft Store for security reasons, so if anyone could help I'd be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p />

            Windows update uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
<br />
<br />When there is a firewall between the Windows Update agent and the Internet, the firewall might need to be configured to allow communication for the HTTP and HTTPS ports used for Windows Update. Windows Update agent uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS to obtain updates.
<br />If your organization does not allow the ports and protocols to be open to all addresses, you can restrict access to the following sites:

<h2>            On Demand GTAV install issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried to install this game twice now...did the original install, then started the game downloaded all the updates. Now just says "downloading" in bottom left of screen. Nothing in active downloads any longer....Restarted the game as I left it in this
 state&nbsp; for several hours. Now it gave me the message "gtav game data is corrupt or missing" and continues with the "downloading" message in bottom left of screen. Still nothing showing in active downloads....really bad if I need to try to download and install
 this for the third time for $60....</p>

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Please could you clear system coach by:</p>
<p>1.Going to your Xbox 360 dashboard</p>
<p>2.Sign into your Account</p>
<p>3.Scroll right until you come to settings</p>
<p>4.Click onto storage</p>
<p>5.Hover over the device that your game is downloaded to</p>
<p>6.Press Y</p>
<p>7.Follow the instructions on screen</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work then you can see if the game is in your recent downloads. You can do this by:</p>
<p>1.Pressing your guide button in the middle of the controller</p>
<p>2.Scroll untill you see download history</p>
<p>3.Click on it</p>
<p>4.See if GTA V is there</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If its there, you will be able to delete the game from your memmory and try installing it again. You can do this by going into your recent downloads or your download history. You should not have to re pay for the game, you may want to check with support
 first about paying for a game that you have already paid for. You may want to check this before continuing with the step above 'deleting the game and re installing it'</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You may also want to make sure that you have enough memory on your device that you are downloading it to. You will need an 8GB of space with an additional 650 KB for game saves.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, if not, please be sure to post back here</p>
<p>Reg</p>

<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your GTA V install.<br />

I would try these steps in this order for re-downloading that game:<br />
<br />

</li><li>Restart your console </li><li>Download the game from your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download History</a> </li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know how that goes.<br />
<br />
<br />

Click Start &gt; Run &gt; Type cmd and hit enter &gt; type ipconfig /renew &lt;there is a space between ipconfig and /renew&gt;<br />
If that doesn't help, try restarting all of the computers and see if the conflict goes away. Once it does, then try and surf and see what happens.<br />

<h2>            Can you connect a USB DONGLE to Microsoft Surface Pro to connect to the internet&#63;</h2>
                    I am really excited &amp; planning on buying a Microsoft Surface Pro and need to know whether I can attach a usb dongle to the usb port 3.0 provided on it, or would I have to survive off the&nbsp;Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. If not, this would be a huge deal
 breaker and I would instead buy a Lenevo IdeaPad Yoga 13 or Lenevo ThinkPad Twist.

<p>Yes and most definitely you are able to use a Ethernet to USB adapter. The Surface PRO will support both internet USB sticks and Ethernet adapters towards the USB port. The Surface PRO should auto load the drivers needed for the USB internet stick, but if
 it doesn't auto load, you may need to manually load these drivers from the respected ISP provider for that particular internet stick.

<p>Hello mccannnmccann1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be something with your internet connection or the way that Fortnite is installed on your console. Try to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a>through your Xbox
 or do a quick reset with your router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the current official status of Fortnite's game servers, you can visit the <a href="https://status.epicgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Epic Games Public Status</a>.&nbsp;Upon reviewing the website, it seems that there were reports of Xbox users' games crashing on September 27th. However, it seems that this issue has since been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>Hey there, mccannmccann1!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the issue you're dealing with currently. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, this has been a kind of common issue when dealing with Fortnite&nbsp;because of&nbsp;it's constant updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be a network problem, but I have had many instances where it was resolved by having the affected party uninstall and reinstall the game.
</p>
<p>If you haven't done that yet, then I'd go ahead and give that a shot following the steps here on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/free-up-hard-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uninstall Xbox One games or apps to free hard drive space</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try that troubleshooting step and let us know how that helped in resolution of the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Little lock symbols on Documents and Settings, Recycle Bin and other Users&#39; directories.</h2>
                    
<p>A friend of mine just got a new Acer laptop with Windows® 7 Home premium on it.</p>
<p>He's used to Windows® XP and navigating to his folders through \Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings to get to his files.&nbsp; (I know, I know, he should have been using MyDocuments all along but old dogs, new tricks, etc., etc.)&nbsp; I have explained to him the his files are
 now in \Users.</p>
<p>However, \Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings has a little tiny lock symbol on the folder and it can not even be opened.&nbsp; Is there any way to navigate in \Documents and&nbsp;Settings and the Recycle&nbsp;Bin under Windows® 7?&nbsp; I kinda liked being able to clean out users' temp
 folders and seeing what was being stashed by various programs....</p>

<p>In Win 7, "\Documents and Settings\" is a "junction point" and not directly accessible (which is why it has a "lock" symbol on it, and can only be seen if you've disabled "Hide Protected System Files")</p>
If you friend must navigate to his files via the C: drive, he'll have to get used to using \Users<br />

    <title>User Profile screen FLASHING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyvarghese27  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Profile screen FLASHING</h2>
                    <p>i had pre-registered for win10 and my win7 pro has 3 user profiles...1 admin, 2nd a standard account and 3rd a guest account and since i was too excited to try win10 post 29th of July... i tried to jump the line and quickly installed win10 thru USB download
 direct from microsoft website and since then surprisingly the Guest profile vanished and i had two user profile left and the one with standard account started having screen flashing... i tried to delete it after backing up data and make a new standard and
 even one more admin account user profiles and to my surprise again both started flashing again... I wonder why the main user profile ( the one being used to to write here ) has no similar problem ?? Is windows 10 pro for single user profiles ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>secondly i tried installing INTEL's driver update utility and there i got an error&nbsp;0x80070643 for some windows installer fatal error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice if these are connected issues and is there any remedy as i have lost the chance to get back to win7 again....</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some of those few people who have successfully activated the in-built Guest account under Win 10&nbsp;have identified the explorer.exe crash/reload loop&nbsp;(flashing screen)&nbsp;mentioned in other posts, which makes the account unusable.</p>
<p>
Another post says that there is a&nbsp;"Deny log on locally" policy in the "Local Security Policy" console (secpol.msc)&nbsp;which has to be manually removed from there.&nbsp; What the heck is that all about?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In order to retrieve data stored in the Guest account of the previous version of Windows the fall back position, if you are unable to retrieve&nbsp;the data&nbsp;by&nbsp;any other means, is that you have a thirty day grace period during which you can roll the installation
 back to the previous version of Windows, having taken care to back up all your data, first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated the in-built Guest account August 01, 2015, by&nbsp; following the <a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</em>from an elevated command prompt (right-click Start/Windows button and select Command Prompt (Admin)).&nbsp; Guest then appeared in the list of available accounts on the lock screen, although it came with the explorer.exe crash reload loop, thus making it unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have, in the past couple of days, activated the Guest account on two more Win 10 PCs.&nbsp; The command line echoed that this had succeeded, and Guest appears, as one of the alternatives,&nbsp;when I click on my account name at the top of the Start Menu, but when
 I select it, instead of switching to the Guest account which is not password protected, it takes me to the lock screen, where Guest is no longer shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft appear to be suppressing the Guest account, for reasons that I/we do not know.&nbsp; We should be told.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
The concensus of opinion in this forum is that it is impossible to recreate in Win 10 the Guest account of previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
The workaround is to create a local user account (you may have to Google (or Bing) how to do that), which, by definition, is not a Microsoft Account, and doesn't require an e-mail adddress, or other identity details.&nbsp; You may also have to Google/Bing how to
 retrieve any docments in your previous version of Windows Guest account, which disappeared when you upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p><br />
Name this new local user account Visitor, and create it as a Standard user, not Administrator, and you will have as close as you are going to get to the old Guest account.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>As you can see the top layer is the dump and the lower layer is the file. The above is taken from BlueScreenView.exe. There is 3 dumps one after the other could some one talk me slowly through them possibly with a highlighter. Things like what are the 4
 parameters? why are they different ? etc.</p>
<p>Thank you in anticipation. </p>

</p><p>The attached DMP file is of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b)</strong></span> bug check.
<em><br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.

</em><br />
This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.</p>

</strong>Enable Driver Verifier if #1 fails:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<p>Original title: Right clicking isnt functions in metro</p>
<p>
</p><p>So out of nowhere yesterday inside my metro UI screen I can no longer right click on anything in order to customize my ease of access. I have tried resetting to a default theme in windows which I was using a windows theme any how and I have looked to make
 sure I have no third party programs active, which I don't. I &nbsp;am very diligent about keeping anything unwanted from downloading. This is very frustrating because while working on things at school I need to have them easily accessible for development tools.
 I have done a scan and come back with no corrupt files and tried disk clean up. Please help.</p>

            I tried the two suggested actions. The Windows store app came up with a display adapter driver might be out of date, but I checked the AMD radeon HD 8670D driver and said it was up to date. Is there any reported issues with radeons recent driver update?
 although the other users which are my roommmates their right click interactions are working correctly, it is only mine, although they barely use my computer. I am curious if I roll back my driver if that might fix the problem.

<h2>            Power Cover Not Detected</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got myself a second hand Surface Pro 2 for work and since I travel a lot without access to a charging socket I picked up a Power Cover too. Unfortunately the Power Cover just doesn't work. At all. I've tried everything I can think of to get it to work
 but nothing has made any difference at all. I've cleaned the contacts with alcohol, I've looked for updates, I've tried Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 and it makes no difference. While my Type Cover has worked absolutely flawlessly the Power Cover has simply never
 even been detected. I've never seen it show up anywhere in the system, even as an unknown or malfunctioning device in Device Manager. It's like the Power Cover is never attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest any ideas for fixing this?&nbsp;</p>

            If you are in the US, you can go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and they will test your Surface and Power cover. Sounds like a hardware issue.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Microsoft has included a number of settings to customize taskbar and Start menu in Windows 10. You can make Start menu and taskbar transparent, add or remove the search box from the taskbar, and configure taskbar to use the

<p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your extensive, polite answer. But ... Two possibilities:</p>
<p>- I don't understand what to do (I really tried step by step, both options).</p>
<p>- your reply is not the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again my problem (it is really an&nbsp;annoyance):</p>
<p>- the taskbar buttons are dark/deep blue (I want blue)</p>
<p>- the text on the buttons is pure black so ... almost unreadable</p>
<p>- I want the text pure WHITE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please send me a screenshot of your taskbar with darkish blue buttons and white characters. And then explain how to do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way: am I the only single person with this question?</p>

</p><p>I have the very same problem, I want the taskbar color to be dark blue, but the text color of taskbar buttons still remains black and almost unreadable (even though the color of the clock for example is white and therefore easily readable). Even when I change
 the color of the taskbar to black the text remains black and therefore absolutely unreadable!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So it must be a weird bug from upgrading. If I switch to the default Windows 10 theme I get white text on the bar, if I switch back to my original theme and wall paper the text goes back to black -&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I know I am posting on a thread a year old. However I upgraded to win 10 sorta recently and ran into this issue. I found out that the source (at least for me) is the upgrade carrying over the old theme. If you aren't running a custom theme or aren't fond
 of your current theme the fix is easy:</p>
<p>1. From Start Search - Change the theme</p>
<p>2. On the window that appears pick a default theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are attached to your theme it is a little harder but certainly doable.</p>
<p>Here is my solution:</p>
<p>Open themes location - %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes</p>
<p>Open the theme you want to fix in notepad</p>
<p>Under heading&nbsp;[VisualStyles] (near the bottom):</p>
<p>Chnage Path=%SystemRoot%\resources\themes\Aero\AeroLite.msstyles to</p>
<p>Path=%SystemRoot%\resources\themes\Aero\Aero.msstyles</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will keep any custom colours, sounds, backgrounds and fix the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope This Helps!</p>

<p>
</p><p>That was the missing piece, all right. I too had unintelligible black text on a dark blue/dark grey/dark red/dark whatever taskbar, and everything I could find online showed me how to change from one dark background to another, but not the text. Argh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The secret handshake appears to be the following, no regedit required:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Bring up the <strong>Personalize</strong> window</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Themes</strong>, then <strong>Theme Settings</strong></p>
<p>3. Select one of the Windows 10 themes (such as, oh, Windows 10)</p>
<p>4. This resets the taskbar text to white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you can rebuild your theme to suit your taste. It seems a lot easier to rebuilt the theme from a readable taskbar than to try to get a readable taskbar from within a theme.</p>

<p>You can usually right click any photo and select properties and see what the security settings are.</p>
<p>Or right click and select open file location, to see where these photos are located exactly compared with the ones you can view.</p>
<p>It might just be a matter of adding them to the other folder.</p>
<p>You also might check your file share settings for your username files, sign in as administrator or something like that.</p>

<h2>            Reinstall Windows 8.1 in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>My computer is only about 18 months old. &nbsp;It won't boot to normal Windows 8.1. &nbsp;It will boot to safe mode. &nbsp;And I can access the internet in safe mode. &nbsp;I have gone through all the trouble shooting aids. &nbsp;All the hardware is good. &nbsp;The autorepair says it
 can't fix anything. &nbsp; I really believe my OS is just a mess. &nbsp;I have had some virus issues in the past. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could only reinstall windows I would be good. &nbsp;I don't have Windows media. &nbsp;I used safeMSI to turn the windows installer on. &nbsp;I downloaded the 8.1 media creation program. &nbsp;It started to run from flash drive, then said it could not complete. &nbsp;I have
 a recovery CD, but that won't work either. &nbsp;I really need some step by step things to get Windows 8.1 reinstalled. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I did make back up / recovery media. &nbsp;Two times. &nbsp;DVDs one time not too long after I got the computer, and a USB drive not too long ago. &nbsp;Then today I created a bootable USB from a link on the Microsoft site. &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;I have a Dell computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS site USB starts to install windows, then says it can't find drivers. &nbsp;So I am stuck there. &nbsp;I have told it to look in the recovery media, but it continues to say it can't find drivers.</p>

<p>Did you contact Dell, as I advised you to do to find out how to reinstall from the Recovery partition?'</p>

                    I have just bought a new computer using Windows 7 and it has crashed 10 times in the last 7 hours or so....<br />
<br />
I either get the blue screen memory dump or it just reboots...<br />
<br />
the event log lists the same critical error "Even 41 Kernel-Power"<br />
<br />
Any ideas why this is happening???<br />

The avgcsrva.exe is an AVG process.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
you have the following crash:<br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0x7F: UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP</strong> <br />
<br />
The UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP bug check has a value of 0x0000007F. This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.
<p>This trap could be a <em>bound trap </em>(a trap the kernel is not permitted to catch) or a
<em>double fault </em>(a fault that occurred while processing an earlier fault, which always results in a system failure)</p>
The first parameter is 0x00000008, which shows me that it is a double fault.
<p><em>Troubleshooting: </em>If you recently added hardware to the computer, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies to determine
 which hardware component failed.</p>
<p>The memory scanner is especially important. Faulty or mismatched memory can cause this bug check. For more informaiton about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Check that all adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use
 an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>If the error appears on a newly installed system, check the availability of updates for the BIOS, the SCSI controller, or network cards. These kind of updates are typically available on the Web site or BBS of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>Confirm that all hard disk drives, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p>If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, you should remove or replace the driver. If, under this circumstance, the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS, you might
 be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console in order to access the file.</p>
<p>Also restart your computer, and then press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when you add only one driver or service at a time.</p>
<p>Overclocking (setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification) can cause this error. If you have overclocked the computer that is experiencing the error, return the CPU to the default clock speed setting.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If you encountered this error while upgrading to a new version of the Windows operating system, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If possible, remove
 all third-party device drivers and system services and disable any virus scanners before you upgrade. Contact the software manufacturer to obtain updates of these tools. Also make sure that you have installed the latest Windows Service Pack.</p>
<p>Finally, if all the above steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing.</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>0x00000008, or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be handled serially, and in this situation
 the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault:
<ul>
<li>A kernel stack overflow. This overflow occurs when a guard page is hit, and the kernel tries to push a trap frame. Because there is no stack left, a stack overflow results, causing the double fault.
</li><li>A hardware problem </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3> gerry beyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 hangs about 30 seconds after resuming from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>After months of proper functioning, my Windows 7 Professional VAIO VPCSB laptop will not longer resume properly from sleep or hibernation.</p>
<p>Upon resuming, things start out great.&nbsp; I enter password, desktop appears, and I can even open programs and use the computer normally -- but only for about 15 seconds.&nbsp; Then, everything freezes.&nbsp; Screen remains on, clock stops running, hard drive stops running,
 caps lock, etc. keys do not work, etc.&nbsp; A hard boot is required.</p>
<p>I've tried lots of the solutions suggested in the forum but nothing has made any difference.</p>
<p>The only thing different about the computer (other than Microsoft updates) was my use of a Bluetooth headset but I cannot find any drivers, etc.that were changed.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated the video drivers directly from the Sony website -- the new version was dated 9/23/11.&nbsp; Updating the drivers did not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the power troubleshooter -- again, no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I removed the Bluetooth headset (actually, I had done that already) -- unfortunately, no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate your suggestions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas??</p>

            <p>I attempted to remove the Display Adapter as per your suggestion.&nbsp; After beginning the uninstall, the computer hung.&nbsp; I did a hard reboot and then updated the drivers again.&nbsp; Problem still remains.</p>
<p>I think you want all of the old drivers uninstalled before the reinstall. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Also, the computer will now not always shut down all the way. The screen will say shutting down and the screen goes dark but the power light remains on and the fan is on.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did as you suggested and the report looked fine to me.</p>
<p>I tried to view powercfg -lastwake but it indicated a wake of 0, guess because it doesn't fully wake although I can even open new programs during the 10-15 seconds after it wakes before it freezes.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hello Gerry Beyer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest checking the drive for errors and included steps below.&nbsp; Are you able to duplicate this problem with a different user account?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check a Drive for errors:</p>

            <p>James,</p>
<p>I performed the complete drive check as you suggested.&nbsp; No problems detected.</p>
<p>I only have one user account.</p>
<p>Interesting note -- if instead of sleep, I hibernate, the computer will resume properly if the hibernation is for a short time (less than 30 minutes) but will only resume for 30 seconds after hibernating overnight.</p>
<p>If you have any additional suggestions, please let me know.</p>
<p>TIA.</p>
<p>Gerry</p>

<p>What is your BIOS version?</p>
<p>What country do you live in?</p>
<p>Hibernation problems can indicate the need for a BIOS update.</p>
