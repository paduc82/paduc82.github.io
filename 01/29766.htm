    <title>Microphone Driver Blocking Incoming Audio Over VoIP Since Creators - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microphone Driver Blocking Incoming Audio Over VoIP Since Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I record a podcast over VoIP with a friend and have been having a problem, which I am almost certain began when I updated to the Windows 10 Creators Update. &nbsp;I own a Blue Yeti microphone (Standard, not Pro, so it does not come with its own driver). &nbsp;I originally
 bought it in February and everything worked like a charm for several months, until I plugged it in August (after installing the update - I had been putting it off for a while, but finally gave in, much to my ensuing regret) and the mic driver had to be set
 up again. &nbsp;After that point, my friend could hear me, but I could not hear him at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several attempts at remedy, including checking my mixer, resetting the sound settings, turning off my firewall, switching VoIP programs, calling over a different wireless network, calling a different person, resetting my PC to factory settings and
 reinstalling everything, I finally was able to solve the problem by unplugging my mic during the call, which I hadn't thought to test at first for obvious reasons, at which point, I could hear him fine again. &nbsp;I then tested it again by unplugging and replugging,
 and have conclusively determined that my being able to hear him is directly correlated with whether my mic driver is active or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this is great in terms of figuring out what was causing the issue, I can't really record the podcast without him hearing me anymore than I could without being able to hear him. &nbsp;I have done some additional tests since, and this issue seems to only
 occur with VoIP. &nbsp;I have played music both on my PC and well as streamed over the Internet and plugging in the microphone does not block the audio from coming out of my speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what settings the microphone driver (again, one Windows is selecting for me, not one that came with the mic) could be modifying that would specifically block incoming audio over VoIP and how I can fix it so that I use my microphone and still
 be able to hear incoming sound over VoIP again? &nbsp;Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Outdated or incompatible driver with the latest update is one of the possible causes why you are unable to hear any incoming sounds. To answer your question, you can check the microphone driver under the device manager to know which driver is being used
 with your microphone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you resolve your concern, kindly update the driver under Device Manager. Open Device Manager&gt; Right click the microphone driver&gt; Properties&gt; Driver tab&gt; Update Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please let us know.</p>

</p><p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to update the microphone driver through Device Manager, but it is telling me that 'The best drivers for your device are already installed.' I also tried looking at Windows Update, since the message told me there might be driver updates available
 there, but when I did the search in Windows Update, it told me that there were no updates to install.</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using my browser when I make these calls. &nbsp;It's through a VoIP program I have installed directly on my hard drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Discord to do our recordings, but we also tried Skype in the course of troubleshooting this problem and had the same issue, so I don't think it is a direct issue with the settings on the VoIP software. &nbsp;I've also been able to play music and video with
 my mic plugged in over both Spotify and YouTube without the audio getting muted, so it doesn't seem to be an issue with my web browser. &nbsp;It's simply when I try to receive audio with my mic plugged in over one of those particular VoIP programs like Discord
 or Skype that I am having this problem, and at least as far as I can tell, this is the only time the audio is affected by my microphone being plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know whether there is some type of specific setting on my computer that only pertains to that audio source that would possibly be getting modified/blocked whenever my microphone drive is active?</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that we have verified that the issue is only happening with the two specific applications, the best thing that we recommend is to roll back to your previous driver and uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. But before that, do you have any other
 microphone that we can use for us to check if the same behavior occurs?</p>

            I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver to no end. &nbsp;I'm not sure how to roll back to a previous driver, but I can try if I have some instructions. &nbsp;The only other mic I have is the in-built laptop mic, which I have verified works fine. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
 although it is fine for talking over Skype, it's not really suitable for recording a podcast (plus I paid $100 for the mic that's not working so I'd like to fix it).

<p>There is no such way for "Never check for updates",</p>
<p>and the Action Centre or Notification Settings does not have "Windows Update" item. For example, it only has "Calendar, Mail, News, Windows Explorer, Windows Feedback". I cannot find anyway to disable the specific message without disabling the whole notification

<p>If so you should know that these instructions are not valid.</p>
<p><strong>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Action Center&gt;Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>There is no such option.</p>

            <p>So, this issue is still unresolved, as the support engineer referred to menus that didn't exist and an issue that was not in question? Looks like a case of a hurried response creating more, not less work for the support staff.</p>

            <p>For the past few years, I have posted several Windows questions here but hardly got any good answer from Microsoft Support Engineers. It is more meaningful to get replies from the users who are frustrated by the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if those Microsoft Support Engineers are real persons or some sort of Microsoft's experiment with artificial intelligence. If they are real persons, I think they are just copy-and-pasting any answers without carefully reading the question
 just to show their boss that they worked and get salary. If they are A.I., they are not good enough.</p>

    <title>Xbox menu not showing up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im keswickian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox menu not showing up</h2>
                    <p>When I press the home button to access the menu it won't show up, the screen will then have this tint (as if the menu was there) and it will be quiet. But when I hold my home button to turn my console/controller off it works.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> george_837  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed to connect to a windows service</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading from windows 8 to 8.1 on my laptop, the following appears every time on start-up...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Failed to connect to a windows service</p>
<p>Windows couldn't connect to group policy client service</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I click on the message it disappears</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, in windows explorer, right click has stopped working. It just hangs. However, right click does still work in internet explorer and excel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure if these two problems are related.</p>
<p>Norton 360 is the anti-virus software on my laptop.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to make any progress.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;ran&nbsp;services.msc there was no "windows all user install agent service" in the list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I tried the alternative of clicking on "change pc settings" there is no "general" to click.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to do a clean boot. If the issue doesn’t persist, then we can assume that the problem was caused by a third party
 program or a driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;type the password, or click Continue.)<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />

    <title>windows 8 recovery disk program stalls&#47;freezes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 8 recovery disk program stalls&#47;freezes</h2>
                    I just purchased a sony vaio laptop with windows 8 installed and am trying to create a windows recovery disk (usb). The program stated that a 32gb flash drive was needed minimum so i purchased a 64gb stick. The program runs fine at first but while it says
 it is copying the recovery partition to the flash drive the progress bar stays at about 50% and will not progress. I left the laptop for a couple hours thinking it would be done when I got back but it was still stuck at 50% (task manager reported no problems
 i.e. program not responding, etc). Has anyone else had this problem? I closed the program and pulled the stick and plugged it back into the laptop, My Computer provides the following details for the drive: 18.2gb free of 31.9gb (64gb stick). Has anyone else
 had problems running the recovery disk utility? This is a brand new laptop with nothing altered except for the installation of google chrome browser. Any info would be appreciated.

            I just had this problem too.&nbsp; Brand new HP Envy.&nbsp; I used a 32GB stick.&nbsp; Brand new:&nbsp; nothing on it.&nbsp; The Recovery Drive creator stalls about 75% for me.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I checked this disk and see that it added some files, but it never finished.<br />
<br />
Has anyone been able to get this product to work??<br />

            I have just purchased an Asus q200e and I am having the same issue. &nbsp; When creating the recovery disk , the tool hangs around 98%. &nbsp;I tried creating the recovery drive using that a spare hard drive and that worked without an issue. &nbsp;My next step is to
 try the same thing on my desktop.

            I also had this same issue on my recently purchased Vaio laptop. It stalls at about 50% on the progress bar using a 32 gb drive. I just contacted Sony to see if they had a solution. I will post their reply .

            Follow-up: &nbsp;I was successfully able to create a USB recovery drive after talking with ASUS tech support. &nbsp; My issue was &nbsp;the recovery process stated that it needed at least a minimum of 16G. &nbsp;I was trying to create the recovery disk using a 16G USB flash
 drive and this seemed to be my problem. &nbsp;I purchased a 32GB and it worked without any issues. &nbsp;This explains why the recovery processed&nbsp;formatted&nbsp;a 32GB partition when I tried to create the image on a HDD.

            Has anyone figured this one out? I have two Asus laptops and have the same problem with both. Somehow with the first one, after many, many tries I got it to create a recovery USB. Don't ask me how, because I don't know. For the life of me I can't get this
 new laptop to create a recovery USB. Tried different&nbsp;USB sticks, turning off antivirus, different format utilities, etc.,&nbsp;without any success. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Update,<br />
<br />
I finally created my recovery partition on USB. Here is what I did, hopefully it works for others. First, I formatted the USB stick with the built in windows format tool. Make sure it is set for FAT32 and uncheck "Quick Format". Then download the HP USB Disk
 Storage Format Tool found here <a href="http://download.cnet.com/HP-USB-Disk-Storage-Format-Tool/3000-2094_4-10974082.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool - CNET Download.com</a>. Open the utility, may have to do it in compatibility mode. Again, make sure it is set for FAT32 and uncheck "Quick Format". Once that is done, create your recovery drive on your USB stick. Good luck and
 post back if that works for you.<br />

            Cosmo727, I started out trying to create the recovery drive on a 64 GB stick (that should be better than a 32 GB stick, right?).&nbsp; The Microsoft recovery program not only stuck at ~90%, it managed to convert the stick to a 32 GB stick.&nbsp; Your method at least
 let me get it back to a 64 GB unit.&nbsp; I then tried using a 32 GB stick, but had the same result as everyone else; it gets to about 90%, then stops doing anything.<br />

<h2>            Is there any way to stop uninstalling a program&#63;  </h2>
                    I tried to remove yahoo toolbar that came with my new printer.&nbsp; After I pressed uninstall, a new window opened saying it might not be from a trusted source and gave me the option of continuing to uninstall or somehow uninstalling it safely and I hit the
 2nd option.&nbsp; Well it never uninstalled and when I tried to uninstall it again, it tells me to please wait until the current program is finished uninstalling or changing.&nbsp; I gave it plenty of time but it's as if it's frozen.&nbsp; I tried deleting temp internet
 files, clearing SSl and then rebooting.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            The audio would be a part of your room, which means, it would be like background music. As long as you are playing it, the person you are talking to will hear it. 
<br />
<br />Its no different from someone entering your room and talking while you are Skype. 
<br />
<br />Skype doesn't have noise cancelling, which is what you are looking for.

<h2>            Mouse and Keyboard doesn&#39;t work in windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi All.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some bizarre reason my mouse and keyboard won't respond when windows 8.1 loads.</div>
<div>the clock on the bottom left hand side is working so its definitely not frozen. I have tried plugging&nbsp;</div>
<div>in another mouse and keyboard with same result.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The keyboard and mouse work in the bios and also the when I enter into the safe mode options.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed 8,1 yesterday which was working fine until this morning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any Ideas??</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Hi, Thanks for the reply.
<div><br />
<div>I have no access to device manager as the keyboard and mouse isn't actively working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately I had to reinstall windows 8 to fix the problem, nothing seemed to work.</div>
<div>Hopefully is will not happen again</div>
<div><br />

            <p>O</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have to respond using my screen keyboard because of this issue.&nbsp; I need my keyboard and its not working on my surface pro since installing windows 8.1.&nbsp; How could Microsoft OS installed on a Microsoft tablet using a Microsoft keyboard not work and be tested
 before releasing to the public.&nbsp; I'm a win store developer and this update disabled my main dev machine... now I need to get a new computer setup so I can continue... is there a way to rollback without uninstalling all my apps?&nbsp; or at the least get a quick
 hot fix out so I can use my surface again.&nbsp; I might as well be using an iPad without my keyboard.&nbsp;

            <p>It looks like you have hijacked somebody's else thread with your problem. The original poster complained about Asus system but you are having problem with Surface Pro. So can you elaborate what your issue is? From what I understand is that you have a Surface
 Pro and you are plugging in USB keyboard and mouse - probably through an external HUB. Those two device don't work for you. So the question is whether you know the HUB itself works? Have you plugged in other devices to the HUB and whether they work? Have you
 looked at the state of keyboard and mouse in the device manager? What is the make and model name of keyboard and mouse?

            I encountered the same problem. I noticed my laptop keyboard and slidepad were working when booting into bios, my problem started after inplace upgrading using DVD from win8 to win8.1. &nbsp;After the first boots it was working, but some keyboarddriver update
 caused the issue installed just before the last update reboot.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But I also noticed external keyboards were working via Docking station and USB ports. I logged in, went to device manager and deinstalled) all keyboard and unknown devices (deinstalled software drivers too when given the option)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I rebooted and all problems were &nbsp;gone.&nbsp;</div>

one should hit INSERT, below the Math Input Panel, then switch to the other app and Paste, because the command Insert merely copies the text to the Clipboard. I have admittedly not tried Excel or Word (not installed yet), but this is not working in Wordpad
 or Notepad or Calculator.&nbsp; Since in these apps "Paste" is greyed out, I am convinced that Insert could not have succeeded in putting the equation into the Clipboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I insert the math expression from Math Input Panel into another app?<br />
I have a Surface Go running Win10.</p>

<p>Hi Janein,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern. However, the default WordPad Notepad are not supported and recognized by Math Input Panel tool. As Math Input Panel tool only support those applications that work with the Mathematical Markup Language also know as Math ML. However,
 this is a valuable suggestion, as there may be other users with similar requirements. We recommend you to provide your feedback and suggestion in

            <p>Mine are in what used to be called a Hotmail account, and on Outlook on my system.&nbsp; I don't know about OneDrive. Should I check there?&nbsp; When I searched online for 'Hotmail signin' I got to my 'other' account and found all of my folders and messages (the
 folders are there in Windows 10, just no msgs, and the syncing claims there's nothing to be found).</p>

            Version Upgrades, or Windows Updates?  

There are added ways in the latest version to control Windows Updates so they don't interfere or are postponed:  http://windowsitpro.com/windows-10/microsoft-gives-users-more-control-upcoming-windows-10-creators-update

To make sure you have the latest version check Settings&gt;System

            Hello,

1. Launch the Registry Editor by running regedit command.
2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU

3. If you don’t have the AU key, create it in the WindowsUpdate. 
4. Create a new DWORD-32 value.
5. Name it NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers.
6. Double-click it, type 1 and click OK.

Close Registry Editor.

Let us know if this helps!

            I cannot remove all of them, er, at least I don't think I can.&nbsp; The email that is associated with my global MS account does not offer a 'delete account' option like the others do.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever find a solution to this? I'm getting the same error message and experiencing the same problem with my gmail account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail is syncing on the app ok, so the error message is just related to the gmail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does the error message actually mean? And how can I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

            I am certainly still waiting for a fix to this that works. I have removed my gmail account and tried to reload it, but it won't.
