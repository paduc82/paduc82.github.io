<h2>            some settings are managed by your organization</h2>
                    Hi all, I have bought new AlienWare laptop and after one month in personalization &nbsp;and update menu in settings I can see "some settings are managed by your organization" &nbsp;however my PC is my own and my account is not corporate. As a result, I can't change
 shortcurts on start menu as before, if I click right button &nbsp;on shortcurt in start menu I will get menu "more" which don't have any stuff for changing it. I google this trouble and tried resolve it by changing privacy settings, but it doesn't work, because
 it is on default. So how can I resolve it?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1dd13ea0-8df1-4cd5-9eb8-36f05e6d6762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1dd13ea0-8df1-4cd5-9eb8-36f05e6d6762" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cee2320-66d1-4f09-b575-de96e24138a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cee2320-66d1-4f09-b575-de96e24138a3" /></a>

            <p>I don't know what was the reason. After second reset of my laptop, it start work normally. I did second reset, because many program become not worked, then SQL server and eclipse with Java stopped work, finally ms office become not worked.</p>
<p>many settings become non-editable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, I think, the problem was in register, because &nbsp;when I tried edit it, it didn't have many nessesary keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all people, why helped me</p>

            Boris, Glad you got this fixed by resetting. If this happens again, all you need to do is clear the Start menu layout and related Policy settings. This guide and the REG file can come in handy.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/personalize-some-settings-managed-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Personalize

            <p>No, it was not helpful, I did it first. But the problem was that privacy settings in my laptop were non-editable.</p>
<p>After, I tried changing settings in group policy, however it was normal sets<br />

            If the Policies were set by editing the registry, or using a 3rd party tool the Group Policy editor would still show "Not configured". &nbsp;In that case, enabling a Policy and then setting it to Not configured would remove the registry values automatically.

<h2>            Update &#40;KB4023057&#41; making my computer non responsive.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past couple of weeks now I have a problem with the above-mentioned update. It installs and my computer begins to run slow&gt; nonrespensive&gt;freezes. I can find and remove this "update" in "add and remove programs" and after I uninstall it my computer
 immediately begins running fine again so I know my issue has to do with this update. I have had to "restore" my laptop twice now because of the aforementioned freezing in order to completely remove the update if I do not catch it in time to remove it manually.&nbsp;
 After the update installs my computer freezes (i.e explorer is nonresponsive) so I do a forced restart and it takes a good 5-10min then my computer goes from slow to freezing again after a couple of minutes hence the "restore" through safe mode. I tried turning
 windows update off (yes, I know windows need to update, NOT the point) thinking Microsoft would "fix" the update and I could install it at a later time after they did. HOWEVER, frustratingly windows update turns its self back on after I turn it off through
 "services"&nbsp; and I end up with this same problem again. I DID...try running the windows update troubleshooter it did not work. Told me the "update files may be corrupt" and I should redownload them it tried and failed. Then when I went to look at what updates
 there where 3-4 of them all had some kind of error either "download error or install error" etc... So I feel like I am back where I started. I was going to try downgrading from windows 10 to windows 7 however since windows 10 came on this computer I can not
 find a way to do that other than buying a copy of windows 7.&nbsp; Kind of a new problem so not sure what to do normally as I memory in the past windows had an update/patch for issues with update etc...It has been long enough and I have googled this problem a few
 time and am not able to find a clear solution. Any help is much appreciated! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP "power station" with windows 10 64bit (home)</p>
<p>Intel processor and Nvidia graphics&nbsp; </p>
<p>(Not your run of the mill laptop in other words) </p>

            You should uninstall this update and block it from happening again. If you block it, it doesn't install on its own. 
<br />
<br />1. Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Under Microsoft Windows, look if KB4023057 is installed &gt; If yes, right click on it and Uninstall 
<br />
<br />2. Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update. Download the tool from below link 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />When you run this, it will search for available updates and list them 
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, however, I couldn't get this to work it say they're no update pending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried a few other things...going into "services" and turning off "background intelligent...." as it works with updates in addition to turning off windows update both keep failing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Tried going into "regedit" also keeps failing.</p>
<p>Also, tried gpedit.msc, when I typed this into command prompt it fails to open altogether and I get an error message.
</p>
<p>Lastly, tried system32 and deleting/renaming the selective dll files (this failed said I wasn't the admin when I am).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very, very frustrated...</p>

    <title>Issue renaming User Folder Using Command Prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bronson hunt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue renaming User Folder Using Command Prompt</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to get my computer fitted with a new hard drive after the old one crashed. I had a new one installed and got most of my files back, however one small difference was that my User folder in C:\Users was simply "User", as opposed to my first
 name as I had it before. I wanted to change this,&nbsp;without making a second account and I've been following this tutorial on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-account-name-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GroovyPost</a>&nbsp;to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten to the point of finding the SID value and going to rename the folder in the elevated cmd, but I've come to a roadblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb646bb-e970-4d04-b95b-10498e36e43c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb646bb-e970-4d04-b95b-10498e36e43c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot discern what process is using it, or find a reliable answer to fix this through Google or other questions here, so any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware that the tutorial is somewhat vague, and even makes an error in giving the wmic command as "<strong>wmic user account list full</strong>" instead of "<strong>wmic useraccount list full</strong>", so I would appreciate any additional help to this
 tutorial along with fixing the above roadblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

            Renaming a user profile folder would cripple this particular account, because the folder's name is embedded in countless places in the registry. This is why Windows prevents you from renaming the folder!

            Hi Bronson 
<br />
<br />It is not advised to rename a User Profile folder in Windows 10, yes, there are tutorials on the web, but honestly, it is ill-advised
<br />
<br />A much better and quicker approach is to create a new user profile as a local account with admin privileges, you then have full control over that folder naming. 
<br />
<br />Then, when the account is created, change that to a Microsoft Account and copy your data into that account . . .

            Hi Bronson
<br />
<br />The SID value you found, did you go into registry for the rest of the steps to find it and modify your user name there?

<p>yesterday (2013-02-28) I installed the <strong>update KB2670838</strong> as sugested by the notice.</p>
<p>Afterwards I have a blue screen when using IE9. </p>
<p>The problem&nbsp;came up&nbsp;just after the selection of some text in IE 9 ...</p>
<p>and every time i tried to do so...</p>
<p>I tried many times with diferent programs by selecting any text and the problem wasn't there...</p>
<p>I tried other browsers and selecting wasn't a problem...</p>
<p>The file pointed out in the blue screen&nbsp;as responsible for the crash&nbsp;was<strong> igdpmd64.sys</strong>
</p>
<p>said to be related with the Intel graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking here and there in forums and advices i decided to look for recent updates</p>
<p>and i noticed the one of Yesterday on graphical matters.</p>
<p>I removed it and hellas... now it is working well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For information and for advice because the update is said to be advisable to be installed.</p>

    <title>Language&#47;Input Indicator blank in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Language&#47;Input Indicator blank in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I have encountered issues with the language indicator appearing at the taskbar in Windows 10. I realized that it's gone yesterday and I went to Settings &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; Turn System Icons On or Off &gt; On for Input Indicator, but there is
 only a gap, blank space in the task bar. I can't even change the input language. I've tried to restart my computer but the issue is still there. Please help!</p>
<p>Please find attached screenshot for your reference!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as the original poster, I've tried everything you suggested except creating a new user account (I'm having difficulty doing this in Windows 10, getting a message that Windows can't connect to Microsoft family). Unfortunately I didn't
 switch on System Restore so can't use this to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found that opening a run dialog (Windows key+R) and typing ctfmon.exe opens an older style language bar but doesn't fix the Windows 10 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reset the PC without deleting my files and programs?</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having exactly the same problem as the first question, as my language indicator is gone missing, or blank at the all time</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I press window key + space, or left alt + left shift, which it should work as language change, it doesn't change.<br />
It's been set as only English whatsoever.<br />
<span>I've found out that language change could be made in the log-in screen, or when I go to this screen when I press ctrl+alt+delete but as I login, or come back to the desktop screen, no language change can be made.</span><br />
I went to Settings &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; Turn System Icons On or Off &gt; On for Input Indicator, but there is only a gap, blank space in the task bar. I can't even change the input language. I've tried to restart my computer but the issue is still there.
 &nbsp;I've also tried making new account, going through&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;system file corruption check, and DSIM check<br />
<br />
</span>Please, help :(</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security products could be&nbsp;causing this error. McAfee, Norton, Windows Live OneCare,<br />
Threatfire are a few. Which antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine now. And<br />
which have you EVER had on it even if you uninstalled them. (These leave remnants which can cause
<br />
strange issues.) <br />
<br />
Make sure Windows Defender is running. <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - set to STARTED and AUTOMATIC<br />

but i won't use upgrade instillation or sfc. scan yet.<br />
i'll wait for windows/defender update that may fix the issue in the feature...<br />
the most important thing that the defender does work.

<h2>            Cannot Upgrade to Gold Subscription</h2>
                    
<p>When I try and upgrade my account to a year Gold Subscription to Xbox Live. Status Code: 80190864 pops up and says, "Cannot retrieve information from Xbox Live. Please try again later." I've tried to upgrade it for several
 weeks now each time I am presented with the error. I also tried upgrading it on the Xbox website but I also got a similiar error. I'm not sure what the problem is, but I know it isn't the payment method.</p>

<h3> julian_p&#126;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana &#126; Type here to search does not minimize to a magnifying glass.</h2>
                    <p>I recently reset Windows 10 and I am pleased with the results.<br />
<br />
Cortana is one of the new features that came bundled with the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the startbar Cortana's "Type here to search" message does not minimize to a magnifying glass symbol.<br />
It shows continuously taking up space. <br />
<br />
Should I activate Cortana's voice reader because my computer has no mic?</p>

            Hi Julian_P
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar, do you see Search - Show Search icon?
<br />
<br />If not, right click your Taskbar, choose Taskbar Settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting page, turn on 'Use Small Taskbar Buttons'
<br />
<br />Does either option result in the magnifying Glass instead of that search Box
<br />
<br />
<br />Please Note, to free up even more space on the Taskbar, you should also be able to choose Search - Hidden, which will hide Cortana on the Taskbar, then if you want to search, just click your start button and begin typing

<h2>            suspended without a reason</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>&nbsp;I recently had my live account suspended, and sent this post to thexbox police:-</p>
<div>
<p>Hi xbox police,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;i was wondering if you could tell me why you have suspended the live account for gatzo Mail<strong>;-[mod removed].</strong> message said there would be an email explaining the suspension but none has arrived. this lack of correspondance leads me to believe
 that there has been an error, if not then please email me and tell me why the suspension.&nbsp; i'm not a booster or cheater, don't use a modified controller nor am i abusive, if u look at my rep i'm a 5* player which would mean that most poeple i play with have
 put me as a preffered player. it would also be nice to know why, when it says i will be unable to sign on to live untill 26-05-2011 which is today i still can't, some answers please would be appreciated as i am paying for a service i can't use without an explaination......
 fair I think not....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the responce</p>
</div>
<div>
<b>Subject:</b> suspended without reason, gatzo.<br />
<b>Posted to:</b> 14 - My LIVE account was suspended<br />
<br />
<b>Reason:</b> Apologies, but we do not respond to inquiries about 24 hour suspensions. Please check the Windows Live ID email associated with your gamertag. If you do not have access to that email anymore, I suggest changing it so that you can receive important
 updates and information from Microsoft. Please refer to the Code of Conduct to help avoid future suspensions: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/codeofconduct This is how to change your Windows Live ID: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945419
</div>
<p>For one thing&nbsp;how annoying is it when moderators delete&nbsp;OUR post's without reading them properly and then basically there saying that they can suspend anyone's account for 24hrs and do not have to supply a reason for it.
</p>
<p>How brilliant a service is that !!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />

<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</font></a><br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

<p>I believe that it is unfair that 98% of all original gamertags are inactive and have be inactive for many, many months/ years. I have always wanted an original tag but it always seems someone has already taken in on an inactive account that has not be sign
 into for years. This is unfair because many people creating accounts with original gamertags forgetting the email and password to sign in to them and even play on them. Original gamertags should be reset it the account shows no sign of life or activity for
 more then a year. The least the person can do is sign in on Xbox.com. Don't do anything to their account but just refresh the gamertags to give someone else a chance.</p>

<h2>            Wireless internet connection for &#34;Guest&#34;user account on Vista</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have configured a connection to my wireless router on my administrator account in Windows Vista. I needed to create a new user account for some friends who are visiting me - so I created a Guest user account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, in this account, my wireless connection, which automatically starts when I logon to my administrator account, does not even appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I can do to ensure that I am connected to the same router when I log on to the guest account?</div>
<div><br />
Thanks</div>

<p><span><span>Hello, nair_r</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The built-in “Guest” account is a very limited account intended for temporary access and as such you won't be able to configure the Wireless settings.
 You may want to keep the Guest account disabled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is recommended you create another Standard account and limit its access through Parental Controls even further if required.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To create a new account, go to Start, Control Panel, User Accounts and Family Safety, and then clicking User Accounts and click Manage another
 account.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. Click Create a new account, type the name you want to give the user account such as “Visitor”, click the Standard
 User account type, and then click Create Account. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>On my tower, it is set up that way, I can't figure out how to duplicate on the new laptop.&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the account perhaps set up to use POP3 on the tower? This configuration only downloads new messages from the server inbox; no other folders are involved, so deleting messages at the server will have no effect locally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't change the type of account; you would have to set up a new POP3 account, then remove the IMAP account. Removing an account removes all of the account folders and permanently deletes their contents, so be sure to save any messages you want to keep
 before removing the account.<br />

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 no longer recognizes devices to sync to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 no longer recognizes devices to sync to</h2>
                    Recently I went to load more music on my Sansa Fuze and Sansa Clip and Windows Media Player no longer recognizes any devices to sync to. The&nbsp; "sync to" is greyed out and the "searching for devices" briefly pops up in a window but then goes away before
 accomplishing anything. I've tried changing the usb mode to msc and mtp but no difference. Op system is Windows 7 Home Premium. Very frustrated with windows as the troubleshooter doesn't detect any problems. I've also removed the Sansas from the device manager
 and reloaded the drivers but no change. Any help would be great. Thanks<br />

<h2>            Surface RT &#47; Windows RT 8.1 - Charms - Settings - Battery Level &#47; Status</h2>
                    <p>I know there is another post somewhat like this, but it was obviously no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I request that Windows RT 8+ have some kind of modern UI status in Charms / Settings that will show the battery percentage and maybe whether the battery is charging, being depleted, fully charged, whether the tablet is running on the wall adapter, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Ha ha, just noticed this today and now I feel silly. All I had to do was swipe in from the right and the status for wifi battery and time showed up on the bottom left when the charms came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SORRY!</p>

            <p>That's useful, but it would be nice if the battery icon showed the percentage as well as a visual representation. Just to make it a little more informative.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that sliver supposed to be 20%, which will let me work for a little longer, or 7%, which means I need to plug it in NOW? We can get that by going to the desktop, but why should be have to?</p>
