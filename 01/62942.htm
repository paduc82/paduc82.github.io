<h2>            Blue screen &#40;of death&#41; with a rolling circle on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Good day all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had had upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked well for the first day before I started having issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I wasn't able to use the "HP Simple Pass fingerprint" sign-in option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually got that resolve by disabling it in device manager then restarted which resolve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then came a constantly flashing cursor as if it's loading something in background (which is annoying) and I can't get to do a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots of people seem to have this issue with everybody suggesting different ways to solve the same issue. Those didn't work for me except one. That said I should "disable" a windows foundation service, which I did in task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On restarting, all I could see after the HP logo is a BLUE screen with a white clockwise circle in the center. This has been going on for hours now with no change.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hp Laptop Webcam and Live Messenger</h2>
                    I have an HP laptop DV6-1245Dx. The built in webcam works with yahoo messenger&nbsp;as well as other applications, yet&nbsp;will not work with Live Messenger. I have the latest drivers and software from HP for this cam. I have the latest version of live messenger.
 I am running Vista 64 bit with SP1. Any thoughts about a work-around to get this to work on Live Messenger? Maybe install SP2? Go to an earlier version of Live Messenger? Is there another version of Live Messenger to be released soon which will overcome this
 problem?&nbsp;Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

            Gloria,<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your response. I did try all that was suggested and much more. However, I found the real problem was not in the software or program. The reason I could not access my webcam in Live Messenger was due to my McAfee anti-virus suite. It was blocking
 access to the cam within Live Messenger. I have since granted full access to this program and have resolved this problem.<br />
<br />
The symptoms shown were, An info box stating " Unable to access webcam " when trying to use audio video setup, and a messege when trying to get someone else to access it; Messenger is not available right bow. Please try again ( 0x8ac70013 ).<br />
<br />
Resolution:<br />
<br />
In McAfee Security Suite, go to " View Recent Events " Click "View Log" button, expand "Internet and Network", click on "Outbound Events", Select "HP MediaSmart Video Main Program". In the "Details" window; "HP MediaSmart Video Main Progam tried to access the
 Internet and was blocked by Firewall". In the "I want" to box, select "Allow Access".<br />
<br />
This resolved my problem.<br />
<br />
This may resolve others with similar problems.<br />
<br />
Thank You for you time and help.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1. Does it happen in other folders too?</p>
<strong>Method 1.</strong> <br />
<p>Check if the issue exists in Safe Mode, if the computer works as expected in safe mode then we can troubleshoot the issue in clean boot state.<br />
a. Refer to the article below for safe mode steps in Windows XP<br />
<strong>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</strong> <br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</p>
<p>b. You are required to perform a clean boot to find the program that is causing this and then disable or remove it.<br />
<strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353/en-us</a><br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps as explained in the article to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2.</strong> <br />
If the issue still persists then create a new user profile and then check if everything is fine. If yes we can fix the corrupt user profile. For more information refer:<br />

            Hi there!<br /><br />If you're signed into Skype but don't see your contacts or Skype Credit, you probably just signed in to a different account than you were expecting to see. <br /> <br /><br />How did this happen?<br /><br />You might have multiple Microsoft accounts and not even know it.<br />Have you ever used Outlook.com, Hotmail, Office 365, OneDrive, Xbox, or Windows? The email address you use for those services can also be used to sign in to Skype. If you have more than one account, you can be signed in to Skype but not with the correct account where your contacts and Skype Credit are stored. <br /> <br />Someone else may have used your device to sign in to their Microsoft account.<br />Someone like a friend, family member, child, or spouse may have used your device to sign in to their account and forgotten to sign back out.<br /><br />Follow these steps to sign in to the correct Skype account:<br /> <br />Do you have more than one Skype account?<br /> <br />Do you use an email address to

            <p>Where was it before?</p>
<p>Seriously - which tool are you speaking of - can you be more specific about when you first encountered this tool, where you obtained it, what you used it for, etc?</p>
<p>There's this:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/183887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of the Windows Registry Checker Tool (Scanreg.exe)</a><br />
(Pre-XP, although why Microsoft is still updating articles for it is beyond me.)</p>
<p>Or do you mean the old "<a href="http://majorgeeks.com/download458.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft RegClean</a>" from 1999?&nbsp; (*fair warning* - Microsoft is still publishing documents about RegClean - but not necessarily in&nbsp;a positive way.&nbsp; Example:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299958</a>; which states in no uncertain terms, "The RegClean utility is no longer supported and has been removed from all Microsoft download sites.")</p>
<p>In any case - I believe you shouldn't need them.&nbsp; If the registry has (somehow) grown to such an extent that it causes more than a few milliseconds of hesitation on your system - you probably have a whole host of other issues you should resolve first.&nbsp; *grin*</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows XP is easy to keep up - it has been around *so long* and been so heavily tweaked and beaten to death (because it was so extensively utilized) that optimizing it and keeping it clean is pretty trivial.&nbsp; I have my suggestions:</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to figure out what all is starting up when your computer does/when you log on.&nbsp; Look up anything you do not know about using
<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or ask here.)&nbsp; You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is
 the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and memory.&nbsp; This can help you recognize applications you might want to look into alternatives for and/or get rid of all together.</p>

<p><strong><u>Do some house cleaning and dust off that hard drive:</u></strong></p>
<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />

<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237</a><br />
.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the
<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>

<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), &nbsp;you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you

    <title>PCI NIC Seen in BIOS but not even recognized in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john kotuby  say:</h3>
<h2>            PCI NIC Seen in BIOS but not even recognized in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell E521 PC runing Windows 7 Pro 32-bit. Up until an electrical storm that affected the onboard NIC, everything was fine. For the time being I plugged in an old Motorola USG wirless port and installed the WinXP drivers for it. It is working.</p>
<p>BUT...I want to go back to a wired LAN because there are benefits to my doing that. I ordered and received 2 PCI 32-bit cards. One is a TrendNet and the other a Rosewill. They are meant for PCI 2.2 and my machine indicates it has PCI 2.3 expansion slots.</p>
<p>Slot number 4 (1 and 2 are&nbsp;PCI Exp and Mini) recognizes the NIC in the&nbsp; Bios as a Network Card. I disabled the On-board NIC. When I boot, no network device shows up in Device Manager. Actually the Wireless Motorola shows up. But I have had multiple NICs
 in other machines with no problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea why Windows 7 will not recognize the card even though the BIOS does? This happens for both cards. The chance of both being DOA is quite small. BTW...they are both supposed to be Windows 7 compliant. The user reviews on NewEgg indicate
 that other users have installed these cards on Windows 7 with no problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

After reading your previous reply, I think you may be right. If other PCI devices are starting to have problems, it sounds like time for a new MB. Like you said, too bad it's a Dell. Maybe a used one could be had from eBay?</p>

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10.

<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<h2>            How do I disable automatic sound levelling&#63;</h2>
                    I'm a new Windows user (just switched from a Mac) and, for the most part, I've loved it. However, my computer has been doing this weird auto-leveling thing with the volume: when I'm listening to a song, for instance, quiet parts will be really loud, and
 loud parts will be really quiet. It'll be fine one moment, then when the song hits its peak, the volume will drop down into the range the quiet part was.
<br />
<br />
I've searched everywhere for a way to turn this off, and it seems like the solution that's worked for most people is going into the Enhancements tab in the sound settings, checking "Disable All Sound Effects" and unchecking "Loudness Equalization." Unfortunately,
 my Enhancements tab is missing. I've seen pictures of where it should be--right between the Levels and Advanced tabs--but it's not there. Instead I have a Tone Controls tab which allows me to adjust Bass and Treble.
<br />
<br />
I've tried updating my sound drivers (they're all up-to-date), selecting "Do nothing" under the Communications tab (which is another solution that's worked for some people), and restarting my computer after each attempt. Nothing's worked so far.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions? Is the Enhancements elsewhere on the most recent version of Windows 7? Is there another solution I've overlooked?<br />

            <p>It sounds like you have set the checkbox for sound levelling in WMP at organise, Options, Library tab.</p>
<p>You might also have to&nbsp;set this at the Control panel entry for your sound card.&nbsp; In addition, look in the Start menu, All programs folders for the sound card as well since many of its settings may be made there.</p>

    <title>Authenticity of used &#47; second-hand copy of Windows 7 Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Authenticity of used &#47; second-hand copy of Windows 7 Ultimate Retail</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.&nbsp; So I wanted to purchase a legitimate copy of retail Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; It seems this is no longer available new, leaving me the option of buying a used / second-hand copy.&nbsp; (BTW are there other options?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a private seller via Amazon, and looked as closely as you can via the Internet; all evidence strongly suggests this is a reliable seller with an established reputation, selling a bona-fide used copy of the software.&nbsp; So I paid a reasonable price
 and have now received the product, including the complete packaging you'd expect to find from a store, with all the certificates and product key and hologrammed DVDs and all the rest looking as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I installed this Win7 and activated the installation with the product key without any difficulties.&nbsp; Then I found some "Genuine" checking page somewhere within microsoft.com, I don't recall the URL exactly right now, but it downloads some small
 .exe, after which the page fully reports the installation as genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have found the utility to produce the "diagnostic report"; the contents of this I will paste in down below.&nbsp; The "292" in the product ID seems to me not to be an MSDN key as I see often reported on here; can someone confirm that these digits are consistent
 with a retail copy purchased in the US via normal legitimate channels?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen very many reports of MSDN product keys being sold with counterfeit retail packaging, but this doesn't seem to be what I have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have not seen any reports of normal retail licenses being copied or resold multiple times, so that doesn't seem likely to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any comments on this?&nbsp; I'm well within the window where I could return this software for a refund, but I'm not seeing any evidence here that this copy is anything but authentic and legitimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to call Microsoft, and have them give any information as to how many times a certain license had been activated before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All advice and information is most welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks--</p>
<p>
</p><p>--dave</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not sleep and wakes from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I am running a clean install of Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>From day 1 it has not slept reliably, and frequently wakes without a good reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have power options set to Balance, monitor off 5 mins, sleep 10 mins.</p>
<p>I also have power button configured to put computer to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer has NEVER gone to sleep after 10 mins.</p>
<p>Power button works to put computer to sleep 1 in every 10 tries.</p>
<p>Selecting sleep from the start menu does always work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When asleep the computer wakes up frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night i made a change...</p>
<p>Power options &gt; Advanced &gt; Sleep &gt; Allow wake timers &gt; *disabled*</p>
<p>This morning i come into the room and find the computer on after putting it to sleep last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>powercfg -lastwake reveals...</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Which isn't really helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have battled with this, searched and read many articles on this subject and am yet to get a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any similar experience?</p>
<p>Have put up with this for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Will re-install Win 7 if this keeps up.</p>

            <p><strong>I have since found this is an issue with Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>Elsewhere in my travels i found confirmation that jitter (tiny constant signals coming from joysticks) resets the system timer for sleep / standby.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a change in Windows 10, where windows now acknowledges joystick input to reset the timer just as much as keyboard and mouse input.</p>
<p>Whilst this can be a good thing (have had PC monitor off whilst gaming and not touching keyboard for long periods) it can also be a bad thing as most joysticks emit constant jitter even when not in use, thus keeping a system awake (the issue i have).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joystick manufacturers are not to blame, and the issue exists regardless of manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem exists for all joystick users i have contacted among my community, and exists with all joysticks that have analogue axes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solution would be for a certain amount of stick movement to be required before the timer is reset, thus eliminating jitter from resetting the timer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>This and several other issues (update downloads unable to be stopped causing lag spikes in games etc) have caused me to return to Windows 7, which is working nicely for me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to going back to Windows 10 once these issues are resolved.</p>
<p>I would like to submit these somewhere, but the ability to find the right department is difficult.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business call forward, delegates.</h2>
                    <p>

</p><p><span>Hi</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Is there a way to change the call forward behavior? So delegates are not listed first, and once for every call option. When using this&nbsp;with an active call.&nbsp;The&nbsp;active call is
 placed over your own number, but after the&nbsp;people, you are delegate fore.&nbsp;This is annoying specially when there are four copy per delegate.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Any solutions or by design?</span></p>

<p>

            Hi Arne,<br />
<br />
It’s not feasible to change the order of the call forwarding list. I totally understand your concern. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via clicking the
<strong>Smile</strong> face in the upper right corner of your Skype for Business client. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’ comments.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Violet

<h3> stu_553  say:</h3>
<h2>            Childproofing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;<span>I have a Windows 10 Home laptop that is used by me, my wife and our young children (6 and 3 years old). I would like to prevent the kids from being able to install
</span><span style="font-style: italic">any</span><span> apps from the Microsoft Store.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an administrator account and the kids have standard user child accounts all linked together in a family, all Microsoft accounts - not local accounts. On the child accounts I have set content
 restrictions to </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Needs adult approval to buy things</span></li><li><span>Email me when my child gets stuff</span></li><li><span>Block inappropriate apps, games &amp; media</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However despite the above the kids are still able to download and install software and games from the store. Windows is letting them install software rated for all ages or rated for 3 year olds and
 up. I would like them to only be able to run Store apps that I approve. Bonus marks if there is also way of stopping them from installing non store apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any method using group policy isn't helpful as group policy isn't available in the home version of Win10.</p>

<p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but unfortunately it is not helpful. I already have those settings in place - apps, games and media that are inappropriate or need to be purchased are already being successfully blocked. However this still allows the kids to install
 apps that are free and rated for all ages. What I want to do is stop the kids from being able to install ANY app without my permission. Is this possible?</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, I'll take a stab at it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OU's are used for managing PCs (and accounts) from Active Directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you'd use an OU if you wanted to configure all PCs in an OU to have a same login screen, toolbars, password requirements, etc.&nbsp; Only administrators can configure settings on OUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 These settings are typically security-related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groups are use for managing permission on Files.&nbsp; So, you'd use a group to allow all the folks in Accounting to have access to a folder on a shared network drive.&nbsp; Any file owner can assign a permission to a group (although, it'd take an administrator to
 first create the group)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in summary:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OU - management of settings (typically on PCs)</p>
<p>Group - assignment of permissions (typically on Files)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Media Center Edition&#63; &#40;ft Error code 5&#41;</h2>
                    Hello, guys. I have an HP Windows 10 Home (HOME!!!) x64 Laptop and my bedroom's HDMI Display can play up to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">3840</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"> × </span><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>2160
 and 30 Hertz. I miss an application called Windows Media Center (WMC). It was supported/built-in in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2kx, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.x, but I wanted the application so bad on Windows 10. Luckily, I found an installer.
 I ran _TestRights as an admin, it worked, one restart later, I ran the Installer as an admin, but error code 5 appeared, I go to see the folder, but there is no such folder. Movies and TV won't start. I miss watching Netflix through Media Center and everything.
 I've followed the tutorial's steps👣, but nothing. Please get me an installler or solution.</span></span><br />

 old. Now it won't start. I don;t know how can I finish my custom theme now...&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/disappointed-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Delvin4444,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. I understand that State of Decay 2 has recently updated and since it's last update, the game has started to crash after 10-15 minutes of gameplay. To begin troubleshooting this issue, you may want to try reinstalling the game; here's
 an article on how to do so: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Uninstall and Reinstall Games on Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>External Microphone not working after update to Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Microphone not working after update to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my recent update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8, I began to get a lot of errors when performing different actions. I managed to fix most of these errors by updating my drivers for Windows 8.1, unfortunately one problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I updated to Windows 8.1 my microphone was functioning, after I finished the update it no longer worked. The microphone is enabled and I can see it in the sound panel, but when I speak no audio goes through. I've updated the Realtek High Definition
 Audio drivers, and i've made sure that the microphone is plugged into the correct jacks and is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop was purchased from Alienware (Dell), and i've been to their drivers update page and detection, i've made sure to download and update all available drivers which included the Realtek Drivers, after this did not work I proceeded to go to the Realtek
 website and manually download the drivers from there, the problem still persists. I've run out of ideas to fix it, your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Plugged the microphone into another computer which is also running Windows 8.1, the recording did not work. I then tried it on another computer on Windows 8, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugged it into the front microphone jack, this time and it worked fine for the first few minutes and then cut out making a weird noise, but when I was on Windows 8 the back jack worked perfectly.</p>

</p><p>You are not alone; I have to upgrade from my Gateway xp netbook since I lost audio playback somehow ,perhaps a marketing update, and have returned two HP "x2-k010nr" and an Asus Transforme. I was going to buy an Acer,however, was informed my the Acer tech
 on their forum not to buy any pc until the MS 8.1 software was FIXED! That was the first honest answer that I have received in two months of screwing around with Microsoft, HP ,ASUS and others. Life is to short to be screwing around with dishonest CORP'S.</p>
