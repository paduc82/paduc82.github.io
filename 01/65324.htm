I concur. Perhaps before you and blow your money on professional you should go&nbsp;and read these to links, and compare them side by side.</p>

<p>It's highly unlikely that Professional will let your work finish any<br />
earlier, and there is not likely to be any other reason why you should<br />
do this. XP Professional and XP Home are exactly the same in all<br />
respects, except that Professional has a few features (mostly related<br />
to networking and security) missing from Home. For most (but not all)<br />
home users, even those with a home network, these features aren't<br />
needed, would never be used, and buying Professional instead of Home<br />
is a waste of money. In general, unless you need to join a domain, you<br />
probably don't need Professional.</p>

Professional allows ten concurrent network connections, and Home only<br />
five.</p>

<p><br />
It seems that no one have answered your question, without first questioning why you are going to Pro.&nbsp; If you are still requiring this, here is what your would need to do:</p>
<p>1) Get Xp Pro with SP3 integrated onto the CD (either originally or slipstreamed.)</p>
<p>2) Revert Internet Explorer back to version 6. (Service Pack 3 might need to be uninstalled if it was installed after you updated to IE 7 / 8.)</p>
<p>3) Disconnect from the Internet</p>
<p>4) Remove anti-virus</p>
<p>5) Process the upgrade to Pro.</p>

            I <span style="font-style: italic">totally </span>agree! I've been all over the net the past two days looking for information on performing an in-place upgrade from XP Home to XP Pro. And, everyone seems intent on talking someone
<br />
I've purchased several refurbished Dell computers and they all came pre-installed with the Home version of Windows. However, I frequently use enterprise versions of software and there
 environment, the upgrade to XP Pro would <span style="font-style: italic">definitely
</span>be worthwhile!<br />
<br />
I've seen numerous references to a supposed hack that "tricks" XP Home into thinking its really Pro. But, what I'm not finding are any ways to install Pro over Home using either an OEM disc or a Licensed copy (.ISO image) of Pro. The licensed copy fails to
 completely boot into setup, all though it runs in Windows just fine. And, the OEM version doesn't have an Upgrade option; only a fresh install and repair.<br />
<br />
Even the solution offered by Chaos_Edit (above) assumes that Setup allows you to perform an upgrade. I realize this thread is several months old. But, does anyone have a solution or workaround for a situation in which there is

    <title>OneDrive downloading EVERY file after resetting OneDrive login. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p-er-armstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive downloading EVERY file after resetting OneDrive login.</h2>
                    <p>I am FED UP with Microsoft for dismissing this issue. EVERY time OneDrive hiccups and logs itself out, it wants to download EVERY file.<br />
EVERY TIME I have had to do a restore of my computer, OneDrive has wanted to download EVERY file.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's official response, "what's your problem? OneDrive is doing what it is supposed to do. It is syncing your files."</p>
<p>Well Microsoft, OneDrive is NOT doing what it is supposed to do. Syncing files means COMPARING what EXISTS and making a determination if a download is necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If a file has the same file size, file name, file dates and times. You can bet the file has NOT changed.</p>
<p>2) OneDrive could do a CRC comparison. Perhaps it already does.</p>
<p>3) In EVERY case, the EXACT SAME files have ALWAYS been in the local OneDrive folder AND in the cloud.</p>
<p>4) OneDrive CONSISTENTLY decides to download the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My settings have ALWAYS been:</p>
<p>1) Start OneDrive on Startup</p>
<p>2) NOT allowing file fetch</p>
<p>3) NOT allowing files on demand (I use my computer offline a lot. I NEED ALL files offline).</p>
<p>4) I ALWAYS have OneDrive in a different location on a different drive.</p>
<p>5) I sync ALL of my files (documents, pictures, videos, and much more).</p>
<p>6) AutoSave of Desktop, Pictures, and Documents are to OneDrive since those folders reside under OneDrive</p>
<p>7) Using Office 2016 downloader is DISABLED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you NEED to correct the issue and make OneDrive more intelligent so it knows that my files do NOT need to be downloaded. 300GB of files downloaded is ridiculous EVERY TIME OneDrive breaks or I do a restore of my computer.</p>

            Your observations are valid.  
<br />
<br />One hallmark of MS is lazy programming. 
<br />
<br />Onedrive simply does not bother to do simple, reasonable checks before wasting bandwidth, it just slams all the files down.  
<br />
<br />Windows update does not save update files to your HD, or if it does, it does not check, so it ends up wasting hundreds of GB in repeat downloads when the Spring Update fails and goes into an endless update and fail loop.  
<br />
<br />(Actually, the first two points reflect MS living in lala land. They seem to think that everyone has a 6" firehose for internet capacity. They act like everyone has a "last mile" fibre optic internet connection with unlimited upload and download.)
<br />
<br />Windows update comes along and "improves" our custom settings back to MS defaults, simply because it is easier for them to program, forcing us to reset application defaults and privacy settings.
<br />
<br />This happens to be the wrong place to submit this type of complaint/ observation.  Not too long ago MS setup the Feedback process  to accept this sort of "feedback".

<p>Oh how I wish feedback did any good. It falls on deaf ears. I can't tell how many times I have complained through feedback and on here and been ignored.<br />
<br />
Another MAJOR gripe I forgot about with this issue of the sync after restarting OneDrive is when it can't reconcile a file. It creates duplicate file with the name of your computer appended to the name of the new file. So you look at the two files, determine
 they are duplicates and delete the newly created file. What does OneDrive do? Since it hasn't finished with its initial sync, it CREATES ANOTHER DUPLICATE. And repeats the process over and over again. The ONLY way to stop it is to allow it to create all the
 duplicate files it wants and let it finish the initial sync. Then look for all *-[computername].* files and delete them.... AFTER you have determined they are true duplicates and that OneDrive has NOT deleted the original. Sometimes I can have hundreds of
 files, sometimes only 20 or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft definitely is sloppy with programming. It is so easy to write simple code to do a better check of files. Heck I run a program called Beyond Compare, it is capable of comparing my entire OneDrive folder against a duplicate folder I keep and does
 so in less than a minute. OneDrive takes about 15 minutes to do the same validation on startup and can't even tell when files are the same!</p>

            Actually they do listen.  I've seen a couple of feedbacks that I've participated in, either submitted or voted/commented on actually have been implemented.
<br />
<br />You are right, 99,99999% have nothing done other than being read by someone at MS. They do do that much.  But if we don't send in those feedbacks, they won't know about the problems we are seeing in the real world.

<h2>            mouse left click brings up context menu</h2>
                    Windows 10.&nbsp; Wired HP mouse began bringing up context menu when clicking left key or right key. Have tried several suggested fixes that have not worked. Found suggestions for Win 7 and Win 8.1 but nothing for this in Win 10.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If left-clicking your mouse shows the context menu, there might be settings that are incorrectly configured, or corrupted drivers, or that it may relate to hardware failure. For us to isolate the issue in using your mouse, kindly respond to the questions
 below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did the issue occur recently? If yes, what changes were made before the issue appeared?</li><li>Are you using a new mouse?</li><li>Does the issue persist when using a different mouse?</li><li>Does the issue persist when you use the mouse to a different computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response</p>

            Im having the same issue. I recently migrated my win 7 htpc to win 10 pro. All was well until 2 days after completion, the pc was running but the screen was off, i turned the screen on, and the mouse wasnt responding to left clicks. Then it would fire
 dozens of left clicks all by itself. Sometimes left click would bring up context menu. I rebooted machine and it automatically reinstalled the optical mouse 3000. This seemed to fix it for a short while but 20 minutes later everything started going haywire
 again. I had no issues with my old c2duo pc using the same mouse. If i had a bad earth on my rebuilt rig it would be happening constantly.&nbsp;

                    Hi all! I'm trying to fix a laptop for a friend who has some important documents she wishes to keep if at all possible&nbsp;
<div>Some of the information I have on hand is:</div>

<div>-The error occurs during bootup</div>
<div>-Stop c000021a {Fatal System Error}&nbsp;

<div>&nbsp;The system has been shut down.</div>
</div>
<div>-So far I have tried a few different strategies which led the same result, but I'm hoping to get some ideas here.</div>

<h2>            KB2887595 cause network issues</h2>
                    <p>Applied kb2887595 update and it seems to kill the DHCP and DNS client services.&nbsp; As a result I get no network.&nbsp; The error from the event log for dhcp client service is as follows:</p>

<p>Note this is an x64 version of win8.1 running on 64 bit hardware so why would the Service Control Manager try to start DHCP client as win32 app.</p>

</p>
<p>- Uninstalled the update and everything is back to normal</p>
<p>- Downloaded the update manually and ran as administrator.&nbsp; The same problem occurs.&nbsp; The file was Windows8.1-KB2887595-v2-x64.msu so definitely download the 64 bit version.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For now I have marked the update as hidden.&nbsp; As this was a rollup does that mean I won't get anymore update until this one is applied?</p>

            <p>My PC&nbsp;installed this update twice first time I restored my PC and on the 2nd time I tried searching for the issue and found this thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue was after&nbsp;a reboot&nbsp;no browser would browse to any site internal or external but I could ping it sites&nbsp;/ remote control other PC's&nbsp;/ receive email in Outlook. Uninstalled as per instructions and worked after reboot.</p>

</p>
<p>I will now hide this update and hope windows update keeps it hidden!</p>

What is your OS SKU? For instance ServerDatacenter, Enterprise, Professional etc?  



Did you turn on Hyper-V feature? If yes, is it on a Hyper-V OS or host OS?  



What if you manually start these two services? Run services.msc in elevated command window, and stop/start the service in the UI.   




Windows 8.1 Professional upgraded from Windows 8.0 Professional 



No I am not running Hyper-V on this computer. 



Tried at the time manually starting the services as administrator.  They failed to start. 



Have uninstalled and hidden the update.  I just worry will this stop other updates downloading.  This was a rollup not an individual patch.  I wish they would stop this rollup **** and just list individual patches to make it easier to identify the problem patch.

            <p>Thanks geckothe1st for replying! So far, I still cannot reproduce this issue. Hence, I still need your help to investigate further. Can you help to collect some logs? the steps are as
</p>
<p>below. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. With the KB2887595 installed on the machine, run the command below in the elevated command prompt<br />
&nbsp;<br />
netsh trace start internetclient provider=Microsoft-Windows-Dhcp-Client provider=Microsoft-Windows-DHCPv6-Client provider=Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client level=5</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Reproduce the problem:&nbsp;try to start dnsclient and dhcp service manually </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Run the command below in elevated command prompt to stop tracing <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>netsh trace stop </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. share the trace. The trace stopping command should tell you where is your trace.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. run "IPConfig /all &gt; ipconfig.txt" and share the ipconfig.txt file. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW, do you have VPN client installed on the machine? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Generally, we don't recommend people to hide the update. This will put your machine unsecure.

<h2>            Computer Files Displaying as Internet Shortcuts on my Internet Browsing History</h2>
                    <p>Hello! This just happened to me this morning (I am using Internet 8), and I first thought it was a virus but all my scans come out as clean. In any case, any document from my network or my documents I open&nbsp;is also becoming an Internet shortcut on my browsing
 history. This gets deleted everytime I have my browser closed, but I do not like a record of my files showing up on the internet history. Has anyone else found a solution that works outside of the two options I have seen online which is 1. unclicking a windows
 search on autocomplete (mine was already unclicked) and 2. disabling recent documents on the taskbar and start menu (I tried this in multiple variations)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried so many ways of rearranging the way I delete my browsing history, but I do not understand why after so many years, my internet history is displaying my movements of my computer. I work at a corporation, and some people use my computer. I do
 not want them having easy access to sensitive documents I use on my computer, and keeping a browser closed at all times when viewing my documents is not possible for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for everyone that can provide some support or help, but this is really something that needs to be resolved in my line of work.Thanks for any help anyone can provide.
</p>

<li>Show windows stacked&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/743a1bbe-0bf6-48f0-9eed-2b8be2a25e51" /></li><li>Show windows side by side&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d16281ca-205e-417a-bec5-13caef9de042" /></li></ul>
<p>example you have 4 windows up, and thus would expect it to be in a nice 2 x 2 grid of the 4 windows, however it displays as if there were 2 more &nbsp;windows - see images above<br />
<br />
resetting Windows explorer does not fix the display issue.<br />
<br />
in contrast using the hot corners works (at least for 4 windows)</p>
<p>(example of what was expected with both Stacked and Side by Side)</p>

            Hi chetanjagkar,<br />
<br />
Corrupted boot system files is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues booting your Windows 7 computer. I would suggest that you try using the Automatic Repair or Startup Repair feature. Startup Repair can detect and fix certain types of system
 problems that might prevent Windows from starting. You can follow the steps in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2674065/error-windows-failed-to-start-a-recent-hardware-or-software-change-mig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and go to the section, <strong>Method 2: Use the Automatic Repair or Startup Repair feature,</strong> and click
<strong>Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

<h3> use4forums  say:</h3>
<h2>            use ROBOCOPY to move files created yesterday to target folders and preserve the folder tree and datetime attributes</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a script to move the files created in previous day in a archive folder(and subfolders) to a new target folder daily.&nbsp; For example, anytime 10/02/2015 I run below script, I would like to move files created on 10/01/2015 and earlier from source
 archives folders to destination folders, with&nbsp;identical folder structure and datetime preserved.&nbsp; Below is my 1st ROBOCOPY command in script.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>robocopy %varSourceArchives% %varTargetArchivesFolder% /MIR /COPYALL /DCOPY:T /MOV /MINAGE:1</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it only move the files older than&nbsp;24 hours from the time I ran the script, rather than the all the files created yesterday.&nbsp;Technically it did what was told, but not exactly I want.&nbsp; It seems if using /COPYALL switch, the /MINAGE:N switch is comparing
 file date &amp; time stamp as file age exclusion, rather than just number of days age exclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I accomplish my goal of moving files of specified number of days old while preserving the date &amp; time stamp of folders and files?&nbsp; Are there any different ROBOCOPY switches to set, or if this&nbsp;involves complex date&nbsp;and&nbsp;the leap year calculation?</p>
<p>

            Me too. &nbsp;As of now it tells me all my .pdf files cannot be found (and I have removed and re-installed acrobat reader numerous times). &nbsp; Windows 8.1 Reader App when clicked simply blinks and goes blank, though two days ago at least it could find a .pdf
 file.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Why it cannot do so now is beyond me ! Clicking on various other app tiles produces no result. &nbsp; I have two printers. I have loaded new drivers from the manufactureres own websites. They are awful.. no access to my printer
 preferences, and they have halved my printer speeds. &nbsp;This is weird, ghastly and I want my familiar windows7 or even windows 8 back again. &nbsp;I bought a new PC to replace an old desktop that was pre-7 and not clever at networking with my W7 laptop. &nbsp;Now my W7
 cannot share the printers although it will network share various data folders as needed. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Cloud is all very well but I am jiggered when I lose broadband access, which happens occasionally. &nbsp;Windows 8 for Dummies helped a bit when I started with Windows
 8. &nbsp; I have no idea how I got to Windows 8.1 except that I installed it kind-of by mistake whe I thought I was getting a Microsoft automatic upgrade. &nbsp; Swear Words Galore, tears (well almost, I am a guy); &nbsp;things thrown around the room and threats to go bite
 the bullet and go to a MAC !!!</span>

<p>Same PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Asus laptop had the&nbsp;c:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop is unavailable on windows 10 after the forced update so I restarted then it gave me the choose keyboard language screen.&nbsp; It wouldn't restore, wouldn't roll back, so my only choice is
 do a hard reset and hopefully my files is still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a new user profile using command prompt, then it gave me this error while trying to login with the new user profile;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"windows couldn't connect to the profsvc service"</p>

            Thank you for your response, I am running windows 10 pro and have updated at each update, on Sunday I was updating to I think 1809. The machine is totally frozen and no matter what option I try after selecting my UK keyboard I end up at select keyboard
 language. It says it cannot continue roll back, I cannot reset pc it gives message it cant reset and says there are no restore points. I tried to down load your media tool twice on this laptop and that says it cannot be used&nbsp; error Ox80042405-0x001A.
<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't know how to get into safe mode the only thing I can do is select the command prompt but even then I don't know if I can or how to make it start in safe mode.
<br />
<br />
Thank you I'm at a loss how Microsoft can do this to our PCs. I'm afraid to let it do a further update to this laptop as then i will have no access to internet.
<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />
Margaret <br />

<p>How are we to create a new user, when we cannot log into the computer? The instructions you linked to rely on access to the start menu, and as far as I've been able to find, no option to create a new user exists on the logon screen (nor should it, for security
 reasons).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Win10 professional, home-built system (ASUS mobo, AMD proc, NVIDIA card). Not sure of the build #, but it's the current update; I had the default settings turned on). Unable to roll back, and I've been able to log in with my admin account --
 I suspect that's because I've never actually logged in with it on this computer before. Currently no windows processes are running in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Attempting to click on the start menu or task bar does nothing, nor does the Win key; Explorer appears not to be running.
</p>
<p>Attempting to access the setting via right-clicking on the desktop met with an error message.
</p>
<p>I locked it (win+L) and and tried to log in with the normal user account again, and got a new error: "Windows couldn't connect to the SENS service. Please contact your System Administrator."
</p>
<p>At this time, I was unable to log back into the Admin account again; I got an "sihost.exe - System Warning" pop-up with "Unknown hard error [OK]."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to alt-tab to this box, or to interact with it; my mouse pointer has disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard-killed my system and it booted to sign-in without issue; trying a rollback now.<br />

<p>my machine is still not functioning due to your update, i managed on 14th restart to get it to install an early version but even that failed telling me no desktop and&nbsp; systemprofle desktop corrupt or missing, it is now saying its taking a bit longer than
 expected but well get there as fast as we can.&nbsp; how long will that be I wonder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is ridiculous that Microsoft can put my machine out of operation and after 6 days I'm wondering if it will ever work again. Why are you are not responding to me and why are you not fixing this issue</p>

            After 15 restarts a button appeared under rollback windows saying rollback windows 10 volume 3. I did that and got in but with no desktop.pressent, I did control alt delete and managed to select task manager, clicked start a new process and then browsed
 to usb where i had created media tools from microsooft site. Found setup.exe on usb and windows startedto instal. &nbsp;It looks ok but was too tired to play with it. Hope this helps others

<p>Hello Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the issue occurs if the default programs to open documents/files such as Word files has changed to a different one. You can check it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Default apps</strong> and scroll down, click <strong>Choose default apps by file type</strong>.</li><li>Just make sure that the file format for Word is set correctly.</li></ol>

            Hey xzanzibarzx,
<br />
<br />You can look for Bing Browser using this program called Autoruns, this will enumerate registry entries and other means of finding startup items so you can either disable them or remove them, you can download it here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/d...</a>
<br />
<br />When running Autoruns, just look for "Bing" (without quotes) in the Filter box, and see if you can find any entries that pop up so you can remove it, or them. Let me know how this goes, and good luck.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Have to continually uninstall and reinstall Marvell AVASTAR Wireless AC- Network controller</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to connect to my work's Wireless connection. It used to work fine, now I am having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network connectivity on this surface pro 4 works fine at home and elsewhere when connecting to wireless networks, so it cannot be a problem with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to connect to my work's wi-fi connection :&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I have signed into the wifi using my network login and password.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;I can connect to the wifi but there is no internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In DEVICE MANAGER I uninstall the&nbsp;Marvell AVASTAR Wireless AC- Network controller and then scan for changes.... no internet</p>
<p>- After uninstalling the network controller and restarting the surface, I can connect to my work wifi.</p>
<p>- at the same time as the non-connection is happening, I can connect to work wifi on my phone and on another tablet so the work connection is working.</p>
<p>- I have checked with my fellow IT staff and the network admin tells me the wifi is fine and no issues are occuring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarise:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the network controller on this surface in order to access my work's wifi connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I 've had similar issues on a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;devices (SP4).&nbsp; Nothing to do with the WiFi equipment that we have (we use a rather expensive corporate stuff).&nbsp; The only solution that seemed to work is to update the firmware, not the wifi driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download firmware&nbsp;from the official website at:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select&nbsp;all .msi&nbsp;download packages e.g. SurfacePro4_Win10_10586_1702001_0.msi&nbsp;&nbsp; unless you know your OS version, as those downloads are quite version specific.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always check your actual version by clicking on start button and just start typing
<em>winver&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run those .msi downloads one by one until you "hit" the right OS version (there will be a message on screen to say that it's unable to run a particular .msi as there is OS version mismatch), then just follow the prompts.&nbsp; Make sure you have at least 50%
 battery capacity and have got your Surface plugged into the mains.&nbsp; Upgrade will take about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sit back and relax.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Is there any possible way to restore my computer back to this morning without ever making a restore point&#63;</h2>
                    I installed something this morning and it came with an add-on that I didn't know about. I uninstalled both of them from my computer, but there's still random advertisements popping up when I scroll over a word. For example: Windows is underlined and in
 blue, so whenever I move my mouse over it, this happens:&nbsp;<a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=149nih&amp;s=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=149nih&amp;s=6</a>&nbsp;I'm pretty positive it's from whatever I installed today. Well, I tried system restore, but I didn't
 have any restore points. My question is, is there anyway I can restore my computer back to the way it was this morning without a restore point? And if not, how can I undo these advertisements that came from the downloads even though I already uninstalled them?

            <blockquote>Is there any way I can restore my computer back to the way it was this morning without a restore point?</blockquote>
Maybe.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>You can restore your registry files manually to an earlier point by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area. Note that
 it might reset your password to an earlier value.</div>
<div>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.</div>
<div>2. Select Repair from the menu that looks like this one:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</div>
<div>3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.</div>
<div>4. Select Repair when prompted.</div>
<div>5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu that looks like this one:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</div>
<div>6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dir C:\Win*</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dir D:\Win*</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dir E:\Win*</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".</div>
<div>7. Type these commands:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32\config</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; xcopy *.* Q:\MyRegBack\</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; cd &nbsp;RegBack</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dir</div>
<div>8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?</div>
<div>9. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y software &nbsp;..</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y System &nbsp;..</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y Sam ..</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)</div>
<div>10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.</div>
<div><br />

            Hi AKfishergrrl 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, you will have no other option but to re-install QuickBooks and the Dymo Printer App.
<br />
<br />Removing AVG is very destructive to your system, it does not come out cleanly, because it embeds itself so deep into Windows
<br />
<br />Before you do that, you should run AVG Remover to get all remnants of AVG out of your system . . .
<br />
