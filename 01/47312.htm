<h2>            BLANK SCREEN ON START UP</h2>
                    <p>I've had the blank screen issue on start up which seems to be quite common after upgrading to Windows 10. For me this has been intermittent which is odd. I have managed to start up in safe mode a couple of times&nbsp;but Windows has said that my graphics card
 drivers are fine so this does not seem to be the problem. I have discovered however that if I hit the shift key during boot up this solves the problem and I boot up normally to my log on screen. I have no idea why this should be. Can anyone explain? And can
 this be cured so that I don't have to do this to boot up normally.</p>

            <p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist&nbsp; you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the&nbsp;PC you are using?</li><li>Are you referring to black screen as Blank screen?</li><li><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? Is it an abrupt issue?</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you verify if you have installed the latest drivers for the video device installed in your PC?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check the below Microsoft Help link and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Troubleshoot black screen problems</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>At this point, if you are unable to access to Windows desktop, I suggest you to perform a System Restore. If you are unable to get past the sign in screen, in order to start
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn938364(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Shift </strong>key down while you select <strong>Power </strong>&gt; <strong>
Restart </strong>(in the bottom right corner of the screen).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Once you are able to access the Recovery Environment, perform a System Restore.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot &gt; </strong><strong>Advanced options &gt; </strong><strong>System Restore</strong></li><li>If prompted, click/tap on an administrator account you want to provide credentials for.</li><li>If this is your first time doing a System Restore, click/tap on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>If you had previously done a System Restore, select (dot) <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select a restore point that you would like to restore Windows back to.</li><li>Review what will be affected by using the selected restore point. When finished, click/tap on
<strong>Close.</strong></li><li>When you are ready to do a System Restore with a selected restore point, click/tap on
<strong>Next.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Further on, review the below Microsoft help link which can help you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Visit: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If it still does not help, I suggest you to download the <strong>Windows 10 ISO
</strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform Automatic Repair using the same ISO media.
</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, tap or click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>
link to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2.&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3.&nbsp;Click, <strong>Advanced Options </strong>and then click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
4.&nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You might require to change the <strong>
boot priority </strong>in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD or USB.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Hardware Change Reactivation</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are multiple threads out there for this already but I think this is different, so if y'all know of a place that has the answer, then my apologies...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just change out some hardware and when I booted up I got hit with the little watermark in the lower right of the screen that says to activate windows. No drama, went to the troubleshooter and selected the option for changed hardware. That put me
 at a point that had a grey box with my PC's name, the version, "To be filled by O.E.M.," and a checkbox saying "This is the device I'm using right now." I checked the box and hit activate, and got sent straight to a page that said "Unable to activate windows.
 we cant reactivate Windows on this device. Try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the other threads said that Tech support will just reactivate for you if they can see that you have a digital copy tied to your account. I don't know if I just got a jerk employee, but the guy I called said I have to have a product key or other proof
 of purchase for Windows 7 (I had been part of the upgrade wave from 7 to 10). I haven't had any proof of purchase for years; I've had this computer for nearly ten years now. I asked the guy if he could just check to see that there was a license attached to
 my microsoft account and he just completely disregarded me and repeated his cute little speech about my needing proof of purchase until I hung up on him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I say something wrong? What do I do? I sure as hell don't want to cough up the money for an activation I already have.</p>

<p>Hey there, thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went with the CMD command and got the installation ID just now, but the tech rep still wanted a full windows seven product key, which I was unable to provide. I can see a partial key, but not the whole thing. Any idea if there's a way I can find the full
 one?</p>

            I'm having the exact same problem except Mine was a fresh install of Windows 10 when I built the PC.&nbsp; I recently did a Motherboard and Processor upgrade and I am having the same problem.&nbsp; My Digital Copy does show up in My Microsoft Account With the Old
 Motherboard and Processor.&nbsp; But I am Also seeing a duplicate of the Device with the New Motherboard and Processor.&nbsp; So I'm seeing the same device twice.&nbsp; One with the old Board and one with the new Board.&nbsp; I believe that when I try to troubleshoot to reactivate
 this new upgrade, it is only showing me the New Device, and not allowing me to select the Old Device for reactivation.&nbsp; He was asking and telling me the same thing.&nbsp; What's your Windows 7 Code.&nbsp; This PC never had Windows 7 on it.&nbsp; My digital copy is literally
 sitting right there and I can't get to it.&nbsp; BOOOOOOOOOO&nbsp; on Microsoft...…….

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.

<br />Did Windows 7 came preinstalled with the computer or you bought a retail license?

<p>Hello Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have bought a retail license as this was a build, but my father probably did the actual purchasing as I was much younger when I did this. I've emailed him to see if he kept track of the product key digitally or physically, but it is too late where
 he is to expect an answer until tomorrow at least.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better&nbsp;understand your query, kindly reply:</p>
<p>1. When you try to ping from the&nbsp;other system to your system what is the response you receive?
</p>
<p>2. Did you manually assign&nbsp;IP addresses to&nbsp;the systems?&nbsp;If yes, make sure that the IP address assigned to the system belong to the same network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you try the following steps and see&nbsp;if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Try resetting NIC in Command prompt</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then click
<strong>Accessories</strong>.</li><li>
<p>Right-click <strong>Command prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If prompt appears, kindly provide administrator password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type the following commands&nbsp;in the elevated command prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type "<strong>ipconfig /release</strong>" and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type &nbsp;"<strong>ipconfig /renew</strong>" and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li>Close Command Prompt<strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Please&nbsp;respond if you have further related queries.</p>

    <title>Printing to PDF produces no text background color - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luca967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing to PDF produces no text background color</h2>
                    <p>I noted recently that a Win10 box I have stopped printing text background color in PDF.</p>
<p>Now, the PDF printer used (Bullzip) didn't change, and I still use it on a Win10 laptop, flawlessly. Anyway today I tried upgrading Bullzip/bioPDF virtual printer, with no results: the same application and files printed from the laptop work, while on this
 desktop they don't.</p>
<p>I was about to address all this to <strong>Bullzip/bioPDF</strong>, since the "Print preview" is working, but then I tried
<strong>Microsoft PDF printer</strong>, and it doesn't work too!</p>
<p>Again, with <strong>Microsoft XPS printer</strong> background colors are rendered properly.</p>
<p>So I start thinking something is wrong with this machine, and the way it renders/raster process it to PDF printers...</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced/solved such situation or has any suggestion?</p>

            <p>Well, I installed <strong>CutePDF </strong>and <strong>PDF24 Creator</strong>, and they get to the same results as
<strong>Bullzip/bioPDF</strong> and <strong>Microsoft PDF printer</strong>, I think that five packages in a row, all with the same results,
<em>have good chances</em> to confirm it's related to this Windows installation, not to the virtual PDF printer I use...</p>

            Yes, it is quite safe to delete the Event Viewers entries. In fact, if you do have problems, I think it's best to delete the entries before you start investigating, there's a lot less to trawl through to find what you want.<br />
<br />
If you save the following as a .bat file, say, "<span style="font-weight: bold">Clear EventViewr.bat</span>" by pasting it into Notepad (only) and selecting
Save as type:</span> window, you'll have an automated clean up tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just double click and off it goes!! :D<br />
Hope that helps <br />

<h2>            SQL Server 2012 SP4 Windows Update keeps failing to install</h2>
                    <p>SQL Server 2012 SP4 is installing fine on other servers, except for our production server. Before installing the update manually, I'm trying to test why it keeps failing by running Windows Update Readiness Tool on our test server, which is identical to out
 production server. When I'm at the process where I'm asked if I want to install the hotfix, after Yes it fails to install. I checked the Event View and WindowsUpdate log, and found this:</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. Microsoft is just sending me a new Xbox one x after being on support for 2 hours with them. Apparently this is a known problem and is hopefully just a bad batch and not a problem with the entire system. </p>

<h3> professorsir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager Has Processes Tab, but No Processes</h2>
                    <p>So my computer just finished updating after a recent restart, and suddenly it was behaving extremely slow...&nbsp; This isn't out of the ordinary for my computer to do this sporadically and normally I can figure out what's causing the problem, but when I opened
 Task Manager to see what was going on it looked like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7d9b3a6-70a9-4993-8087-dd169c8fec9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7d9b3a6-70a9-4993-8087-dd169c8fec9e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is that the performance values continue to refresh- I can still see when my computer's resources are being used- but not a single process is listed.&nbsp; I've tried restarting my computer multiple times and booting into safe mode but Task Manager
 still looks like this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done tons of searching but so far have not found anyone else with this problem, so any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Based on the details provided, there are a lot of possible factors for this matter to occur. We recommend that you perform a disk cleanup and clean boot.

<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R

<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to the desktop then check for the update history t</span><span>o check for failed updates and error code.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:Check for Update History</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to check which <span>Windows</span> updates are failed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Open </span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span> Update by clicking the
</span></span><span><b><span>Start</span></b></span><span><span> button. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><b><span>Update</span></b></span><span><span>, and then, in the list of results, click

</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click <span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></b></p>

<p><span>If you are not able to boot to the desktop then perform the below methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method: 3 Check in Safe mode and Clean Boot</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Check in Safe mode.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode.</span><span> Safe mode starts
<span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
<span>Windows</span> are installed</span></p>

<b>Step 2:</b> <strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to the safe mode, then perform clean boot. To set the computer in clean boot follow the steps from the below mentioned link:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:

<b>Note: </b><span>After</span> checking in clean boot, follow <b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: System Restore from Windows Recovery Environment<br />
</span></b><span>If startup repair fails, then perform System Restore by using your system restore disc in Windows Recovery Environment mode.</span></p>

 which is now down to 10. I tried to uninstall the program but it also freezes up. Tried upgrading and reinstalling expression web but it wont let me and a screen says the windows installer service is busy configuring another program please complete the active
 installation and click retry to continue click cancel to cancel setup. What can I do to allow me to use my expression web 2 Thanks</p>

<h2>            Delayed wakeup from sleep and MB logo splash screen shows for seconds before waking</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10 my computer now takes several seconds to wakeup from sleep mode and before waking shows the ASUS logo splash screen before waking up. I've never had any delay like this before and certainly no logo splash screen during wakeup.
 Why the delay and why the logo splash screen?

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I suspect that you're waking up your PC from Hibernation mode. Why because, you can only see the BIOS&nbsp;screen when you wake up your PC from Hibernation mode.&nbsp;Usually
 the&nbsp;system will go to Hibernation mode after some time during sleep mode. This happens as the time set in your power settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Say for example, there is an option called
<strong><span>Hibernate after </span></strong>under
<strong><span>Sleep </span></strong>in Advanced power options. If&nbsp;you put this value to 10, then it means that system should go into hibernate mode from sleep mode after 10 minutes of sleep. If that is the case,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Power options </strong>and select the same from the list</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* On left pane, click
<strong>Choose when to turn off the display,</strong> then select <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Under
<strong>Advanced settings </strong>tab, click <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable
</strong>and go to <strong>Sleep /&gt; Hibernate after/&gt; Settings:</strong> there set the value to
<strong>Never</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>or</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> as per the requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
After appropriate changes, check if problem still persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Many thanks for your help. I checked as you advised and found that my Hibernate settings were already at "never".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the problem. I'm still really puzzled why the MB splash screen still shows up. Your comment that the Hibernation settings will cause that was very interesting and so I'm wondering if somehow those settings are still in question. I just rechecked
 and "never" is the setting and "no" on all password settings. Any more good thoughts about this problem?

<h2>            black screen in published windows movie maker movie&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have spent hours making this video, with different videos from my last day of school. They are all from the same camera and all shot under same settings, the problem is though, that after I publish the movie, only&nbsp;SOME of the video is black screen
 but with audio, even after working perfectly in the preview mode in Windows Movie Maker. Also, it is worth noting that the more times I try to save the movie, the more of the videos become black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does this mean?! and how can I fix it? </p>
<p>I'm not entirely clued in on computer language or how they work, so yeah im stressing becuase this video has taken me hours!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have now.. if that helps, it starts to go black around 8.55.</p>

<br />
Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites.<br />
<br />
Below&nbsp;I will post a generic bluescreen troubleshooter and in the next message how to update<br />
drivers and BIOS as well as do memory checks.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong><br />
<br />
The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
<br />
<br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>
<p>1</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><br />
If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are compatible with the version of Windows being installed. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

I just turned on my browser google chrome I'm running windows 7 and it came in as vgrabber/bing and I don't know where it came from and how it got onto my laptop. I tried getting rid of it but can't find it in my control pannel or in any of my files. I typed
 in the search and it doesn't find it either. How can I remove something I can't find but I know it is there?

<p>Hello Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way of telling when games become available as backward compatible. They had a voting system in place for a while so all could vote on games they wanted to become available. unfortunately, now the voting is closed and the only way to request a
 game to become backward compatible is to suggest it with the developer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Runtime Error Program C&#58;&#92;Pr... R6025 Pure Virtual Function - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Runtime Error Program C&#58;&#92;Pr... R6025 Pure Virtual Function Call</h2>
                    I've been dealing with this issue for months now.&nbsp; I own a fairly new Dell XPS laptop (6 months or so) with Windows 7 installed and only a month or two after having it, I started getting the following error dialog box pop up at my user login screen:<br />
<br />
<b>Runtime Error Program C:\Pr... R6025 Pure Virtual Function Call</b><br />
<br />
This seems to pop up fairly regularly, and only on the login screen to my user account where it asks for my password.&nbsp; I can usually just hit the OK button and it goes away, and I can login just fine, however, occasionally, after hitting the OK button, it will
 ding and the error dialog will just keep popping up, ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
I've looked up solutions for this problem all over the internet but keep getting nowhere.&nbsp; It would seem that when the vast majority of people get this error, the text in the dialog box shows: "<b>Program C:\Program Files\<i>program name</i></b>", etc, to show
 you which software program is experiencing the runtime error, therefore allowing them to track down a solution.&nbsp; Mine however, only shows "<b>Program C:\Pr...</b>", so I have no idea which software is experiencing the issue, but it seems like it could be something
 with the user login or possibly a startup application???<br />
<br />
The only other bit of information I can think to provide would be that my computer uses FastAccess camera facial recognition to verify that I am the user, therefore logging me in without the need to enter a password.&nbsp; Maybe this is what is experiencing the
 runtime error?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated as this has been a nuisance for me for months.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
Chris<br />

1. I tried to automatically repair.. which was unsuccessful..<br />
2. I tried to refresh my PC but it said my recovery CD is not valid.. (don't know how)<br />
3. I tried to enter safe mode with all options(normal, with command promt, with networking), but failed and again it showed me the Blue screen with same error..<br />
4.I tried each and every option given by the recovery CD EXCEPT the RESET option, which i Don't want to do, as i am lacking the backup of my files.<br />
<br />
I hope, Someone will assist me.. SOOON....&nbsp;<br />

Which is true?<br />
"Yesterday, i updated my windows 8.. and after restarting my laptop (Dell Inspiron 5520) the blue screen appeared with a frown smiley showing CRITICAL PROCESS DIED.. "</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Which implies to me things 'died' right after you upgraded to Windows 8 - never actually working in Windows 8?)</p>
<p>&nbsp; or</p>
<p>"all this happened when i updated my windows with a critical update (windows defender)...."</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Which could mean you successfully installed Windows 8, used it for some time [even a few minutes] and then updated and got the issue you are describing OR perhaps you were having issues before the upgrade and hoped the upgrade would fix things?)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The "recovery CD" you speak of - that is the Dell one?&nbsp; Yeah - that's for recovering the machine to factory defaults - which is unlikely to be Windows 8 with all of your files on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Or - am I misunderstanding and you ARE using the SHIFT+F8 recovery options at boot time - the Windows 8 tools (nothing to do with Dell.)<br />

I upgraded my windows some where around 17th december 2012..<br />
so, OPTION 2..<br />
this happened while UPDATING my windows.....<br />
the "recovery CD" i am speaking of is NOT the DELL one... rather its the ONE I made it using WINDOWS recovery Options in Control Panel....<br />
I am not able to use the restore and recovery(using image of the files) options..

            <p>I recently fixed a laptop with the same :( frowning face blue screen of death loop. All the laptop would do is restart continuously. I was able to fix the issue without a factory recovery disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a firm believer the only reason these discs are not provided, like the good old days, is all due to greed. Why not make the customer order one separately. Off my soapbox moving on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specs of the laptop I was working with was a Dell Inspiron 14z-5423 windows 8 machine. I had a windows 8.1 OEM I used when I built a previous gaming PC. I was able to use this OEM to run a diagnostic but nothing seemed to change at this point (even though
 it didn't seem to help I thought is was worth noting). I tried about every available recovery option on the OEM without success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accidentally I stumbled onto the second outlined solution but this one WORKED :) ! I held down F2 or (F12 depending on your setting). This loaded into Setup Utilities go to Boot --&gt; Boot Option #1. Make sure to change Boot Option #1 to --&gt; OS. This will
 place Windows Boot Manager into Boot Option #2. I saved changes and exited the Setup Utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything corrected itself during the next restart. Windows started applying update configurations and started without a hitch. I hope this helps anyone else in need of recovering further laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a great day,</p>
