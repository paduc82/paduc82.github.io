<h2>            Frequent freezes&#47;hangs, action center &#38; start unresponsive, apps not functioning after anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>I originally posted this in the surface forum, but possibly more appropriate here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface pro 4 i5/256gb was running great until I installed the Windows 10 anniversary update. After installing it, the system would randomly freeze, particularly after any notification from the action center. Clicking on the notification seemed to immediately
 stop the action center from responding, as well as the start menu and taskbar. Hitting the windows key would sometimes make the&nbsp; whole screen refresh to the desktop and seemingly reload the start menu/taskbar/action center. But the system would be very unstable
 after that with programs randomly freezing. The sound is not functioning properly either. Pre-loaded apps like skype and Pandora will open and allow me to log in, but won't actually work - i.e., no music will play and calls won't go through on skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow which discovered corrupted files. I subsequently created a usb drive with a clean image of windows using the windows media creation tool and reinstalled a clean version of windows, completely wiping the hard drive. Now when I run sfc /scannow
 the tool says that it finds no integrity violations. Nevertheless, the problems persist. The system still frequently freezes with the same unresponsiveness from the start menu / taskbar / action center. Notification sounds don't play. Web pages that typically
 worked fine are not loading or becoming unresponsive in edge and/or chrome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reliability monitor says that windows explorer, windows shell experience host, and edge have stopped working at various times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few web searches suggest that other users may be experiencing similar issues, but it's not clear to me whether this is widespread.&nbsp; To be clear: This has been happening from a totally clean install of windows and virtually nothing installed that wasn't
 pre-installed with windows or another Microsoft product (e.g., office 365). Please help.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Arun, but none of this helped.&nbsp; I ran both DISM commands you recommended and neither found any problems.&nbsp; I have all available updates, and the link you&nbsp;shared is not relevant. Besides, this is&nbsp;happening on a completely clean installation of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time a notification appears, if I click on it, taskbar/action center/start freeze and become unresponsive. In fact, it actually just happened right now as I was writing this message and subsequently,</p>

            This did not change anything. I created a new account. Logged in with that account and immediately when the first notification appeared, the action center/start menu/taskbar all froze and become unresponsive.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FYI, the Dropbox desktop client seems to be the source (or at least a source) of problems. After uninstalling the dropbox desktop client, everything is working correctly as far as I
 can tell. I haven't yet been able to generate the action center/taskbar/start menu hang, notifications are working (with sound), and apps that previously were not functioning properly seem to be working correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If this is indeed the source of the issue, I would hope microsoft and dropbox would find a way to make the dropbox desktop client work correctly in the new windows build.&nbsp;</span></p>

            UPDATE: I spoke too soon. Started seeing the same behavior after a restart after uninstalling dropbox. &nbsp;I clicked on a twitter notification that popped up from the action center, and immediately windows explorer (action center/taskbar/start menu) stopped
 working, became unresponsive, and had to be restarted.&nbsp;

            <p>The hangs are still happening after installing the new build that microsoft released today (8/9), so unfortunately the new build didn't solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to analyze the wait chain in task manager. &nbsp;Windows Shell Experience Host was waiting on svchost.exe. When I end the process tree for windows shell experience host, action center, taskbar, and start menu become responsive again. svchost.exe
 also was waiting on itself. After ending the windows shell experience host process tree or task, it will reload but within 30 seconds it will be suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it could be related, I also noticed that searchUI.exe was suspended and becomes suspended similarly within 30 seconds of ending the task.</p>

            I hope it stays that way for you, Graham. It's happened to me since installing both those updates, although it does seem to be less frequent. Fingers crossed it's only an occasional hang from now on.

            <p>Other threads about problems with Windows Shell Experience Host suggested that previous issues with this process were somehow connected to having the desktop background on slideshow (seriously!?). So for the heck of it, I switched my desktop background to
 a static image and I can't be sure, but it does seem like performance is better, i.e., the action center/taskbar/start menu issues are not happening. For example, after switching to a static desktop background and restarting, I'm getting notification sounds
 again (which previously wasn't the case) and action center seems to be showing notifications more frequently and without hanging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be shocked (or maybe I wouldn't be) if this solves the issue, but I'm curious whether others experiencing this problem see a change after switching to a static desktop image.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Program won&#39;t load in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I updated to Win 8.1 this morning, and now an online game I play won't load. I get an Application error 0x0000142. I reinstalled the game and got a message that a DLL file was missing. Any suggestions?<br />
Is there a way to go back to Windows 8 until these issues are settled?<br />

            I found this post in AO forums : - <br />
<br />
"this is an unofficial workaround that I discovered through using tools like Dependency Walker, Nexon will need to fix these bugs more officially or report these compatibility bugs to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Go into your root installation directory for Atlantica (ex: "C:\Nexon\Atlantica") and:<br />
<br />
1) set both Atlantica.exe and AtlanticaRun.exe to run in compatibility mode for Windows 8<br />
2) delete both 'winhttp.dll' and 'wininet.dll'&nbsp;&nbsp; (or rename them to 'winhttp.dll.bak' and 'wininet.dll.bak')<br />
<br />
Let me know if this works for you, it worked for me on Windows 8.1 RTM"<br />
<br />
It's not my work but posted here http://atlantica.nexon.net/Community/#%2Fshowthread.php%3F1002234-AO-client-compatibility-with-new-official-WINDOWS-8-1-OS<br />
<br />
i've just carried out this work around myself has i had the same error as you've listed here and it works for windows 8.1 and im back playing AO<br />
<br />
I renamed the files not delete them - but i dont think that will change the result ;)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you like it did me!<br />

With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

<p>First of all, you will need an active internet connection to download the game. Even if you have the game on disc, the console has to download the game with the special Xbox 360 emulator from the Xbox marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the game has been downloaded, and you made sure your console is set as the Home Console for the account that purchased the game, you can play Xbox 360 games offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't own Skate, I don't know the online requirements for the game itself, so if the Xbox 360 version required you to play with an active online connection, so would the backwards compatible version.</p>
<p>If the Xbox 360 version was able to be played offline, so will the backwards compatible version work as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However: You will HAVE TO be online when you first start a Xbox 360 game to be able to download your profile into the emulated Xbox 360 of the game, and create the cloud save space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you could also play the game offline, if Skate on the Xbox 360 was able to be played offline.</p>

<p>Hello there Denise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning the inability to use your PowerA wireless controller on your Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the controller is a 3rd party item, this may be due to an incompatibility related matter to which the controller is hindering the recognition onto the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously stated, Xbox One controllers are intended to be plug in and play devices, to which drivers are almost always automatically updated on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be best to reach out to <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/PowerA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PowerA</a></strong> in regards to this inquiry, just to ensure that the device is fully compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<h2>            Win 7 DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE &#40;9f&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For the last week I have been continuously getting a BSOD everytime I try to put my computer to sleep or hibernate. I have done a system restore and I still continue to get this. I have no idea what is causing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this Gateway desktop since 2008 and upgraded it from Vista to Win 7 a few years ago. Intel Core 2 Quad - 8 GB of Ram &nbsp;- 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in trying to figure what is causing this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

 to recover Windows. Here's link.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, i was able to backup my data on hard disk using hp recovery manager.</p>
<p>Also, i did a reset then which downgraded my pc to windows 8.1 and now its working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when i contacted hp support, they asked me to do some diagnosis tests and it was fount that my hard drive was corrupted and it was the culprit, not windows 10. So my hard drive will be replaced now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do have a few questions/issues now also :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The reset i did deleted almost all my software's like MS office which were in C drive and which came as pre-installed at the time of purchase of laptop. How could I get them again and from where ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am not able to login with my Microsoft account in windows 8.1, it is prompting me to login with local account. So now I am not able to download any apps and stuff. Please help on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I upgraded to windows 10 last year as a part of free upgrade policy, how can i do that again now as I am not seeing any updates now. Also is it recommended to upgrade to windows 10? Let me know.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>1) Here's all you need to know about Windows 10 reset by HTG <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/132428/everything-you-need-to-know-about-refreshing-and-resetting-your-windows-8-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/132428/everything-you-need-to-know-about-refreshing-and-resetting-your-windows-8-pc/</a></p>
<p>2) Here's how to login with Microsoft account. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17201/windows-10-sign-in-with-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17201/windows-10-sign-in-with-a-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>3) If you upgraded to windows 10 and activated your license, you can use the media creation tool to reinstall W10. When it asks for your key, just skip that and it will be activated latter.</p>

</p><p><strong>Hello. Here's my canned reply for creator update failures.</strong></p>

<p>Hello! The first thing you need to do is check if your computer can run the Creator.</p>

<p>Next you could run the update trouble shooter. I would run it a couple of times.</p>

                    Why does the webpage size keep getting smaller or bigger while I am online? Am I touching a button or pressing something by accident? This is happening to my daughter too. We both have sony vaio laptops. Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a way
 to prevent this from happening?

            It could be that one of the CTRL keys on your keyboard is stuck by dirt or sticky coke, or a design defect on this model since it happens on 2 different laptops:<br />
If you use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down your pages in Internet Explorer, CTRL+wheel is a shortcut for the zoom, which would cause this symptom.<br />
<br />
The Vaio seems to use a complex configuration of keyboard key drivers, search the web for "sony vaio ctrl key" to see some of these horror stories and the way other users solved the issue. Add your precise Vaio model name to the search string for more accurate
 results.<br />
Check also if the FN function keys are working properly, go to the Sony web site to check for driver updates for your model and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If you need to clean up the keyboard, I suggest you seek professional help.

<h2>            Windows 8 and 8.1 Email Notification</h2>
                    &nbsp;So Just an FYI if it helps anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is email related sound notification on 8 or 8.1&nbsp;- I found a solution after some time that may be helpful to others trying to learn a new system.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a similar problem when trying to use imported wav files
 and use with&nbsp;Outlook 2013 for mail notification&nbsp;and I have found out that on windows XP and 7 which I use on other computers -- when you go to Control Panel sound settings - "New Mail Notification " was where I changed the sound for email but on Windows 8
 and 8.1 it doesn't work.&nbsp; Windows 8 and 8.1 has a new program event &nbsp;"Desktop Mail Notification to change the sound and it worked fine when mail arrived on Outlook.&nbsp; Of course you have to have Windows Media Player as your default player setup correctly and
 this you do in your default settings file.&nbsp; So if it is email related sounds this one fooled me with the new Program event addition.&nbsp; So hope it helps anyone in the sa

<h2>            Surface 3 Pro - Scheduled wake from Sleep not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a brand new Surface 3 Pro. I put it to sleep in the evening, in the morning I want it to wake up (activate screen) and start a certain application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to achieve this via Task Scheduler, but didn't succeed, no matter which options I activate.</p>
<p>The desired app get's launched AS SOON AS I wake the screen with mouse clicks or by pressing the Power button, but the tablet (at least the screen) doesn't wake up automatically.</p>
<p>MS Support (both Surface Support &amp; Windows Support) couldn't help (???) and were redirecting me to one another... (!!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already disabled Hibernate so the Surface is definitely in SLEEP.</p>
<p>I activated "wake timers" for Sleep mode, so they appear in Energy Options, and enabled them for both AC and battery</p>
<p>Important Options in Taskscheduler:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Allow ...to reactivate Computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Execute Task no matter if User is logged in</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is possible on Surface 3 PRO, since Windows Alarm does exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>It was possible via Task Scheduler since Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone can help me to</p>
<p>1) write a small script (that activates screen) and start it via Task Scheduler, then start my app</p>
<p>2) find an alarm App from the Store that allows me not only to play sounds, but also to start Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>

    <title>Windows 8 desktop window manager always high CPU consumption when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sid you  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 desktop window manager always high CPU consumption when screen is off</h2>
                    Hi, recently I find that my laptop's cpu fan starts noisy when I close my laptop lid and when the screen display is off.&nbsp;
<div>I opened task manager window and every time when the screen switched on again you can see that the "Desktop Window Manager" always stays above 25% CPU. But 2 and 3 seconds later it will get down to under 0.5%.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I never notice that before because when the screen turns off by itself normally we are leaving or not in front of it. Also you can only catch it within 2 or 3 seconds because you can not monitor it when the screen is black or lid is closed. So I have tried
 several times to confirm that it is this task which makes the fan always running even the laptop is idle or you leave it alone.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it a bug especially for Windows 8 pro? Because I know that in Windows 8 the DWM service is always running at background and can not be closed.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows operating system doesn't expire unless you're enrolled to our Windows Insider program. In line with this, may we verify if you enrolled to our Windows Insider program? If not, may we ask if how did you obtain a Windows 10 license? Did you purchase
 a retail version or did you avail the free Windows 10 upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, to further troubleshoot your concern, we just a have a few questions for you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version of Windows are you using?</li><li>Were there any recent changes that happened on your device?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, we recommend that you use the System Update Readiness tool to mitigate your concern regarding the missing dll files. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the steps indicated on the operating system that you're using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

<p>Hi there and thanks for coming back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the free version of win 10 which in my understanding there is a digital licence all ready therefor I dont have to mess with it. From the other hand the operating system I have is win7 with a service pack 1. i havent done any changes to the system itself
 except what the system did on its own. Meaning from the moment it was start to download the upgrade something happened and i got the problems I described in my initial post. As because there are many issues with it, I have download (directly from Dell for
 example all drivers, all bios, and anything it was available for my pc) but nothing seems to work. I have download dll files and drivers without any luck. But as I had enough with it, I will give it to an expert and finish with it. Either ways thanks</p>

            <p>I have the same Netbook model and I would like to update to Windows 10 once it seems safe to do so.<br />
Unfortunately a few people have reported similar problems to the one on this page.<br />
Windows 7 is now trying to force me to do the upgrade.</p>
<p>Why does Microsoft say it is ready to upgrade and try to force the upgrade, when neither Microsoft nor Asus seems to have a suitable set of drivers ready?</p>
<p>I'm actually even more frustrated with Asus, because they could easily solve this and yet they seem to be completely silent about it.</p>
<p>I'm also horrified by Microsoft representatives who reckon you can use these netbooks without any functionality of the blue function keys - you can't.</p>

            Here's my story.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 and the advanced keyboard functions stopped working.&nbsp; I was getting a trackpad driver error message but it still worked.&nbsp; After poking around the internet for several hours I found a Windows 10 driver for another
 PC model that worked and fixed all issues.&nbsp; Then Windows had a big update about a month and a half ago.&nbsp; The advanced keyboard functions still worked but I was getting the trackpad error again.&nbsp; A month later another windows update cured the trackpad error
 now the advanced keyboard functions are no longer working.&nbsp; I tried the tried the update driver bit already mentioned, NO luck.&nbsp; It reports my driver is up to date.&nbsp; The problem is the driver failed while the WiFi was turned off.&nbsp; Now I can't turn the WiFi
 back on.&nbsp; Anybody have any ideas on a keyboard driver?

<h2>            USB type-C earphones on Windows 10 not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Asus GL502VS laptop, and it has pre-installed windows 10, and also includes a USB type-c port. Several days ago, I bought a phone with USB type-c earphones, and thought to try them out on my laptop since my laptop has USB-C. It turns out that
 the earphones aren't functioning on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not even recognize the earphones as a playback device. I am thinking that the earphones should function on my laptop since they both are USB type-C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hello Darleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, and sorry for my late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your first question, I got these earphones with my new HTC U11 phone. I don't know the model or make of it. I am sorry.</p>
<p>For the second question, I have just tried it on my friend's laptop. My earphones does not show as a playback device on his laptop, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I tried the link you shared, unfortunately, it was also not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Since the issue is not limited to your device, there is a possibility that your earphones is not compatible with laptops. In this case, it will be best to contact the device manufacturer of your earphones to have them check what
 devices are compatible to the earphones.</p>

<p>I don't think it's the issue with the earphone that come with HTC U11, since my earphone that comes with HTC U Ultra is facing the same issue.&nbsp; What I had noticed is that Android system comes with an application "USB Type C to Audio"; will this be the issue
 of Microsoft Windows 10 since I could not find any similar driver or programs.&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing your updates!</p>

<h2>            Volume control graphic is too large</h2>
                    <p>I installed the November Windows 10 update today and now my volume control graphic is larger and seems a bit pixelated as well. It really annoys me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e24bb96-e609-45ad-970d-52cf2202fc92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e24bb96-e609-45ad-970d-52cf2202fc92" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before that, I installed an old game, FIFA 2005 to be more precise that runs on smaller resolution and got a message that the game adjusted the preferences of my computer so that the game runs properly or something like that. Also, after the update, I got
 a notification that some Intel driver or something is no longer working for Windows 10. I'm sorry I can't be more specific with these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I see my screenshot was reduced in size, so it might not look as big to you now. If anyone cares to check, they could take a screenshot of their own volume graphic and then re-size it to the size of my screenshot and compare the two.</p>

<h2>            seagate diskwizard crashing windows 7 on startup &#40;for old pc using 3tb drive&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So my windows 7 started crashing on start-up (blue screen, recovery mode required) about 2 weeks back, I'm assuming after a certain windows update as I've had no problems before then. After reinstalling windows and going through each software install, I've
 isolated the problem to the Seagate Diskwizard software which I use to be able to partition my 3tb main drive such that I can get past the 2tb limit and create a secondary data drive with the remainder (I have an older pc, with old BIOS that doesn't recognize
 3tb).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software and partition has been on my machine for quite awhile ever since I bought the drive...but only until 2 weeks ago after installing some windows updates did this problem start cropping up. Now just installing Seagate Diskwizard will cause the
 crash issue to occur. Does anyone have any solutions or alternative software suggestions for my situation?</p>

            <p>Hi Isha, thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>I have already performed a system restore which is how I am able to use this pc right now to the point before DiskWizard was installed. Originally I could not get a system restore to work as I'm guessing there was corrupted data so I had to do a clean install
 of Windows 7. It's after reinstalling 7 and slowly installing and rebooting as I performed each windows update and software installs that I deduced the problem was caused by DiskWizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Unfortunately no drivers are available in searching for Seagate's drivers for my HDD... (Barracuda 7200)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>As I mentioned above I've performed installing windows updates and rebooting each time and at this point I am up to date on the windows updates. Everything works and boots fine as long as I don't install DiskWizard...which will still blue-screen my windows
 at start-up and cause me to have to perform Method 1 :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've sent this query to Seagate tech support and they appear to be aware of the problem but claim that it happens extremely rarely and is hard to pinpoint...and other than a registry clean (I have a clean windows 7 reinstall so I shouldn't have an issue
 here) they didn't really suggest anything else too helpful :( &nbsp;I'm starting to think I might just be hosed...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping Microsoft may have a solution since this only started happening after recent windows updates, but if this is an extremely rare case as Seagate suggests it might not even be a blip in the radar of bugs to look into :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am not even sure if there are other possible alternative software to DiskWizard I can use that might somehow circumvent whatever is causing the conflict in drivers. So if you or anyone knows that might be helpful for me as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Just wanted to add that at the original onset of this problem (before system restore got corrupted) I was able to reset to a recovery and successful boot date of 7/05/2016 if I remember correctly. Which I'm guessing was when I performed a windows update
 since it created the restore point...but other then that I don't remember other details such as exactly which update started this problem. But I guess I can't &nbsp;just not perform windows updates anymore past that point either since they seem kind of crucial
 in the long run :/</p>

            <p>At the cost of hard disks you could get a smaller disk (&lt;2TB) for the operating system and use the 3TB (GPT) disk for storage, and get rid of the Seagate disk crutch.</p>
