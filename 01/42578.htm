<h2>            Can&#39;t open&#47;uninstall Google Chrome &#43; Cant download anything via Internet Explorer due to Error 1053</h2>
                    <p>I don't know why but suddenly one day when I used my computer after I started it up, I tried
<strong>clicking on the Google Chrome</strong>. It would have a<strong> buffer circle next to the&nbsp;cursor
</strong>for a moment and then disappear and still <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Google Chrome wouldn't open at all</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span> I then use Internet Explorer(IE) to substitute it and
<strong>hours later the Chrome would either pop up but with a blank background and a notification that says the tab&nbsp;has crashed or just not pop up at all to begin with.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard it could be solved by cache cleaning so I tried <strong>downloading softwares
</strong>on IE but surprisingly when I <strong>try to download, each time it pops up a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> "<em>Error 1053:&nbsp;The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion</em>".</span></strong> I then
<strong>tried downloading other things but the same problem occurs</strong>. This is the first time that his has happened to me. So I tried finding a solution to the problem, in which<strong> windows archived article says we should download the "Microsoft .NET
 Framework 1.1". </strong>But when I tried downloading it the following notification pops up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The upgrade patch cannot be installed by the Windows Installer service because the program to be upgraded may&nbsp;be missing or the upgrade patch may update a different version of the program. Verify that the&nbsp;program to be upgraded&nbsp;exists on your computer
 and that you have the correct&nbsp;upgrade patch"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me how to solve these two problems?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the version of .Net Framework already installed in the PC?</li><li>Have you installed all the Windows updates in the PC?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the PC?</li></ul>
<p>I would suggest you to first place the computer in clean boot state and then install all the pending Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install Windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd like Windows to install important updates as they become available, turn on automatic updating. Important updates provide significant benefits, such as improved security and reliability. You can also set Windows to automatically install recommended
 updates, which can address noncritical problems and help enhance your computing experience. Optional updates are not downloaded or installed automatically. To learn more about the types of updates that Microsoft publishes, see
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/turn-automatic-updating-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Turn automatic updating on or off</span></a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/change-how-windows-installs-or-notifies-you-about-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Change how Windows installs or notifies you about updates</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Update by clicking the <span>
<strong>Start</strong></span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />. In the search box, type
<span><strong>Update</strong></span>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<p>In the left pane, click <strong><span>Check for updates</span></strong>, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you see a message telling you that important updates are available, or telling you to review important updates, click the message to view and select the important updates to install.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the list, click the important updates for more information. Select the check boxes for any updates that you want to install, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong><span>Install updates</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Read and accept the license terms, and then click <span>
<strong>Finish</strong></span> if the update requires it. <span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If language packs are available, install only the languages that you use.</li><li>Some updates might require that you restart your computer to finish installing. Save and close all your programs before restarting to prevent data loss.</li></ul>
<p>Windows Update keeps an update history so that you can check which updates were installed and when. For more information, see
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/see-which-windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">See which Windows updates are installed</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Additional information:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating your computer by using automatic updating, or by manually checking for updates, is the preferred way to get updates. Sometimes, however, computer, security software, or connection problems can prevent scanning or installation of updates.
 When this happens, here are a few things you can try: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you have automatic updates turned on but some updates fail, try scanning for updates manually. This can sometimes fix the problem.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Be sure your computer is virus-free and malware-free. Run your antivirus and antispyware scanners before running Windows Update.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Close all your programs, and restart your computer. It is possible that another program might be preventing Windows Update from working.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Check your Internet connection. Be sure you can visit other websites before running Windows Update. Connection problems can trigger errors that can appear to be caused by other factors.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you know the update you need, such as a service pack or security update, you can search the Microsoft website. Most updates also have a knowledge base article (KB) that explains the update, and most updates provide instructions on how to
 download and install manually.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you continue to see errors, see this <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Go to support.microsoft.com and search for">
</li></ul>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Make Cortana removable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinker101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make Cortana removable</h2>
                    I run Windows 10 on a 128GB SSD and with windows 10 ever growing with future updates I think it should be made possible to completely uninstall cortana without breaking anything. I ran a powershell script I found online that removes a bunch of stuff but
 didn't actually free up much space on the drive at all. Currently if I subtract the amount of space I'm using up on the drive and were to delete it all tomorrow or move it to another drive I still wouldn't have 40GB free out of 128GB.

</p><blockquote>... I think it should be made possible to completely uninstall cortana without breaking anything ...</blockquote>
<p>Sit tight for a while, because exactly what you say is now in the works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana is changing. Microsoft concluded - wisely, in my view - that Cortana as a personal assistant is just too far behind Google Assistant and Alexa, and since by now most users have settled in with Google Assistant or Alexa or Siri, there's no room in
 the marketplace for a new entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has been written in stone, you understand, but Cortana is going to become a digital guide to help you use your software. Microsoft is going to make Cortana a separate app that will be available to any developer. Expect to see it on Microsoft Office
 first. Like any app, you'll be able to install it or uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't do anything now to break your operating system. Wait for the changes to come to you.</p>

</p><p>Cool and yeah that would be interesting if she become an assistant that guided users as to how to use a new app they downloaded as well as someone you can query on how to do something in a program. It sounds like quite a project though on a revolutionary

<p>Can someone help me figure out why my computer wont boot from the DVD drive. I am trying to load the original OS, XP version. I have went into setup and set the boot sequence to boot from the DVD but it continues to boot from the HD. I have even went as
 far as to disable the HD, but then it will come up with a Novel analaysis screen. Any suggestions why this is happening?&nbsp; Thanks in advance</p>

            make sure you are not trying to boot using a wireless or usb powered keyboard..and try&nbsp;this
<p>try One of these&nbsp; combinations &nbsp;will&nbsp; get you into setup.</p>
<p>DELETE<br />
F1<br />
F2<br />
F10<br />
CTRL+ALT+ESC<br />
CTRL+ALT+ENTER<br />
CTRL+ALT+S<br />
CTRL+ALT+INSERT<br />
CTRL+A<br />
CTRL+F1<br />
CTRL+S</p>
<p>Once in the system bios you will need to use the Enter key, Up/Down keys and Plus Minus keys to navigate with and make the changes, each bios is different so you will have to look for the Boot Sequence area and make the changes, once done be sure to save
 them and re/boot with the OS/CD in the drive.</p>
<p><br />
New/Clean Install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1=Set Bios to boot from CD/ROM as first boot device<br />
2=Place the OS/CD in the CD/ROM drive and Re-Boot<br />
3=Watch for the prompt to "press any key to boot from CD/ROM" Press ASAP</p>

</div>
<div>I am also having issues with installing the Windows 7 service pack 1 for x64 based systems (KB976932.) &nbsp;I recently upgraded to Windows 7 and now I am unable to successfully install the SP 1 update. I downloaded and ran the Checking System Update Readiness
 and found no errors; included below is my log.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additionally, I did a full scan for malicious files and found nothing. The only other problem that has been occurring is that&nbsp;occasionally when I put my computer on sleep or hibernate and I turn it back on, the log in will not appear. It will just be a
 blank screen with the Windows 7 background but it will not let me log-in. Then I have to force quit the computer and start it again, and it will work. Any advice would be helpful, thank you!!!!&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Slechte vertaling van de Nederlandse versie van de Xbox &#91;One&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,</p><p><br /></p><p>Al een tijdje erger ik mij aan de slechte vertalingen die genormaliseerd op het platform van Xbox. Woorden als "Achievements", "Een party starten", Community, ect. Simpel vanwege het feit dat het volstrekt onnodig is en het getuigd van zeer gebrekkig taalgebruik. Ik ben zelf werkzaam binnen de IT als software-engineer en ben mij deze lakse trend van uitermate slecht Nederlands taalgebruik meer dan bewust.&nbsp; </p><p><br /></p><p>Het is in mijn ogen daarom ook de belangrijke verantwoordelijkheid van Microsoft Nederland om met correcte vertalingen te komen van deze Engelstalige termen. Gezien de populariteit van hun platformen onder bijvoorbeeld de Nederlandse jeugd [Windows, Xbox]. Een mooie Nederlandse vertaling voor de Engelstalige term "Achievement" zou heel mooi als Prestatie vertaald kunnen worden. "Prestatie ontgrendeld!" is al heel gangbaar binnen het Nederlandse Steam platform. "Een party starten" zou een beetje gek zijn om deze letterlijk naar het Ned

<h2>            Sound not working for YouTube videos</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Dell XPS laptop from WinXP to Win8. &nbsp;Now, although I DO have sound from the laptop for some things (such as, I get a nice audible sound when clicking on the slider at 100% on the Speakers icon), when playing something from YouTube,
 I now hear nothing. &nbsp;Also, if I plug in my connector to my Logitech speakers, I now hear nothing from the speakers &amp; the audible sound on the 100% slider on the Speaker icon is softer. &nbsp;How do I fix this?

<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>a) Click on the volume icon in the
 windows system tray (in the right-hand lower corner of the taskbar), and then click on the link labeled "Mixer".<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
d) Make sure that the volume level belonging to Internet Explorer is not set to mute.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b><span> Download and install Silverlight 5<br />

            Hi Dwight.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd run all Maintenance tasks available on the printer Control Panel.  This is likely a printer problem more than Windows.  
<br />
<br />See also the User guide downloaded from here:  <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-color-laserjet-pro-mfp-m177-series/5303438/manuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-color-l...</a>
<br />
<br />Also from the Drivers section download and install the latest Firmware and full Software package. <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-color-laserjet-pro-mfp-m177-series/5303438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br /> I'd uninstall any in Setttings &gt; Apps and Features first, then restart PC before installing.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

            Hi Kabir, this can be fixed in the Registry . . 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />On the left, navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
<br />
<br />Then in the right pane, right click an empty space and choose New - DWORD (32bit)
<br />
<br />Name that DWORD: ForceStartSize
<br />
<br />Double click that new DWORD and set its value to: 2
<br />
<br />Save and Exit the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Restart Windows
<br />
<br />That's It!

    <title>Disconnected&#58; Session no longer available. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disconnected&#58; Session no longer available.</h2>
                    
<p>Here is the story.</p>
<p>We have one xbox 360 and have really been getting into the Left 4 Dead series.&nbsp; We decided to get a second one so we could play with all four of us via system link.&nbsp; The game was already installed on xbox #1 (the older, white one).&nbsp; I bought the Slim 4gb
 xbox (xbox #2) and another copy of L4D2 yesterday.&nbsp; Then we connected both xbox's with an ethernet cable.</p>
<p>From the L4D2 main menu we went to versus -&gt; play with friends -&gt; create game (on xbox #2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On xbox #1, we went to versus -&gt; play with friends and could see the lobby on #2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when we tried to join, we got the error "Disconnected: Session no longer available."</p>
<p>It is obviously passing data back and forth over a standard ethernet cable, so I can only assume it is auto-sensing and a crossover cable isn't necessary.&nbsp; So I did some googling and found out that it might be a storage concern and the 4.4gb game might need
 to be installed to play this way.&nbsp; So I picked up the 320gb drive today.&nbsp; I added that to xbox #2 and installed L4D2 on it, and we still got the same error.</p>
<p>So then I wondered if it was a version error between both games even though I don't remember either of them being patched at any time.&nbsp; I deleted everything L4D2 off of both machines and reinstalled.&nbsp; And I still get the same error.</p>
<p>I don't get it.&nbsp; The only physical layer equipment between the 2 machines is a CAT5 cable.&nbsp; The latency is probably about nil.&nbsp; The two machines are obviously talking as I can see any lobby created on the other machine, but it won't let me join it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is the only game we have a duplicate of, so I can only test with it.&nbsp; I don't get it...&nbsp; Is there something I am missing?</p>

<p>Hola alguien sabe como se repara este error, es que el otro dia estaba jugando halo reach en la consola de mi primo (yo lleve el disco a su casa) y estaba usando la opciones de kinect y ahora cuando quiero jugar el halo Reach en mi consola me sale este mensaje
 de error 03-57-00. Acepto que el disco esta algo dañado, pero si pongo el juego en la consola de mi primo si lo lee.....<br />
<br />
Porfa si alguien sabe como repararlo me avise...<br />
<br />
P.D. La consola la compre este año y hasta ayer me habia estado funcionando bien. Ya probe con otros juego y si los carga solo el halo reach no funciona.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response,&nbsp;Michael.&nbsp; After a lot of time wasted looking for an answer, I left the Microsoft site and did an external search.&nbsp; Found an answer quickly: The _Wow64 files listed&nbsp;by Autoruns are not supposed to be found&nbsp;or mucked with.&nbsp; I'm
 content with the explanation. It does strike me as absurd that it was much more efficient to search for the answer outside the Microsoft website.</p>

Is it able to find and repair broken files? If not, restore all uxtheme files and the explorer.exe from the DVD [3]<br />

            <p>If the on-board audio component is recognized as present by Windows 7, it will show in your Device manager display.&nbsp; It should have an up to date driver installed already.</p>
<p>

            i uninstalled the one i have which is an realtek souund card driver. The reason i want the microsoft sound driver is because it gave me the option to use bass booast, which i liked. i dont seem to understand how to get it back.

<p>Hello, I have accidentally signed up to the Forum ambassador program on this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://xcl.xbox.com/Apply.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xcl.xbox.com/Apply.aspx</a>&nbsp;I was the bottom one I didn't mean to sign up to. I was seeing what the Ambassadors had to do
 and then unknowingly I had signed up but sure accident. I wish to be removed from the program ASAP please as it is not something I wish to be apart of. Thankyou</p>

<p>So far, you are not an ambassador as your forums badge does not show the ambassador laurel. If you end up being an ambassador, and do not wish to be one, you should private message any official support person on the forums and ask to be removed. You can
 also just do nothing and sooner or later you will be removed because of lack of activity.

<p>
</p><p>Hi Anannya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have kinda the same problem with my&nbsp;(Internal SATA) LG CT21N. It's slim blu-ray super multi combo drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire 5745-5387 (Laptop). I&nbsp;had Win 7 home premium (64-bit)&nbsp;installed and it (ct21n)&nbsp;worked fine. THEN I upgraded to Win 8.1 (64-bit). NOW it doesn't work like it used to. It reads&nbsp;CD's fine, but won't write/burn CD's. Computer recognizes
 it fine in Device Manager also. It is listed under DVD/CD-Rom Drives with NO exclamation&nbsp;marks or anything indicating that&nbsp;there is an error. &nbsp;It also has installed the latest driver for it. I try and look up for a newest and/or latest driver often and it
 keeps telling me that the latest drivers for it is already installed.&nbsp;But when I insert DVD w/ content in it, it recognizes it as a BLANK DVD. It also won't burn/write content onto DVD's. My main concern&nbsp;is to be able to burn/write content onto DVD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked ACER.com website support/drivers, enter my SNID number&nbsp;and they only provide drivers for Win 7 and no other OS. I also checked LG.com/commercial/optical drives/lg-ct21n and I noticed that under Technical Specifications Tab, under Operating Systems,
 it only works on WIN 7 and down. Does that have anything to do with it? I checked for a firmware update also but can't find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, I read sum of your replies to other people reporting problems, and you mentioned trying&nbsp;to troubleshoot the problem by going into the registry. I tried doing what you had said by going into</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}....and I couldn't find Upperfilters or Lowerfilters. So I'm pretty much stuck now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to mention that I tried going onto Windows update for the latest drivers but nothing is found. I also installed (registered) Advanced Driver Updater but still no luck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to mention that a buddy of mine also upgraded from Win 7 to Win 8.1 on a Acer Aspire Desktop and he too is experiencing the exact same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if this post is too long. Thank&nbsp;you very much for reading this. Any help would be&nbsp;VERY appreciated. I would hate to have to downgrade back to Win 7 just to be able to use it again. I LIKE Win 8.1....alott!!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I followed your steps and they do not work--so yes, we need further assistance. &nbsp;What bothers me re: your final response is you direct us back to an October 6, 2014 solution for what was described above as a March 1, 2016 update problem (meaning--this problem
 didn't show up until March 1, 2016--so please don't direct us to an Oct. 6th solution for what is obviously a March 1, 2016 update problem).</p>
<p>In my home, after your March 1, 2016 Windows 10 update-- all three laptops in the home immediately could no longer access the internet. (The laptops are of three different brands/models). &nbsp;The day before--and of course during the update, these three laptops
 were all able to access the internet via wifi. &nbsp;Not surprisingly, my ipad (which of course doesn't run on Windows 10) was able access the internet via wifi on March 1, 2016--so, this isn't a wifi problem. &nbsp;All three computers can access the internet via ethernet
 connection. &nbsp;And--all three laptops can access the internet via wifi if they are within 6 inches of the wifi/router. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All three laptops months earlier downloaded Windows 10 and were able to access the internet via wifi just fine until March 1, 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you would be so kind and look into this. &nbsp;I doubt I am alone in my complaint.</p>

            <p>And here we sit -- 5 days into the problem--and Microsoft has no answer to our problem. &nbsp;The internet is full of posts all stating Windows 10 upgrades effect wifi in some of the laptops out there. &nbsp;I've tried every "solution" posted by Microsoft, Youtube,
 and every other crack pot post out there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, again--do me the courtesy of either providing a 'new' solution, admitting you have no clue, promising a fix in the next update or tell me where I can sell three non-functional laptops with Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How can I get all the drivers on a newly windows 10 laptop&#47;pc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marinel cipu  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get all the drivers on a newly windows 10 laptop&#47;pc</h2>
                    <p>Hey , I just want to know , how can i get all needed drivers for any new windows 10 machine. I know that windows will try to install them , on all new machines, but it will not install the perfect drivers and it will also not install all the&nbsp; drivers ( I
 think ).&nbsp; I know that you can go to the manufacturer's site , if you are on a laptop , and you can download all the drivers from here, in my case , i have a lenovo laptop , but the process is boring , to stay and wait for every driver to install&nbsp; , and then
 to download (manually - you need to download all these drivers manually ) and install the next one from the manufacturer's site.&nbsp; I dont know if the guy which installed the os downloaded any driver from my manufacturer's site BECAUSE i dont see any folder
 with drivers in C drive . I only see a folder called driver ( in c drive ) , which contains a setup file called ACPIdriver, what is that? And yeah , he probably waited for the windows to automatically download these drivers , but i don't see any mistake ,
 they're all good .</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; So , the conclusion is : it's a boring process to download all the needed drivers from the manufacturer's site ( even on a laptop , because on a desktop you can't download them from the manufacturer's site , because you dont have any manufacturer ) , so
 ,&nbsp; this case , you will need a GOOD PROGRAM , that will install the CORRECT DRIVERS AND THE NEWEST&nbsp; drivers for your machine , and yeah , how i said before , even on a laptop you need that , because the process in boring to download them from the manufacturer's
 site and to click on each driver to download( manually ) , and PROBABLY the manufacturer will not update the drivers that are listed on his site , so they're probably old, i dont know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So guys , If you can help me , please give me a good link for a good software that installs all the drivers for example 3dp chip&nbsp; , what do you think about this one , is it good ? Many people are saying good words about this program . And DriverPack Solution
 or DriverSolution Pack ( i forgot the name ) is a good program , but I would like to work with 3dchip . What do you think about 3dp chip , guys ? Is it good ? Or , if you know more programs like 3dp chip or driver pack etc.. , that are also very good , you
 can give me a link&nbsp; for these programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks !&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven't used 3D Chip but DriverPack does work well in our organization specially&nbsp;for custom builds. However,</p>
<p><strong>You must use the manufacturer provides drivers first.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If they not, you can use other utilities. Make sure to deselect unnecessary stuff from DriverPack before trigger.</p>

<p>I haven't used 3D Chip but DriverPack does work well in our organization specially&nbsp;for custom builds. However,</p>
<p><strong>You must use the manufacturer provides drivers first.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If they not, you can use other utilities. Make sure to deselect unnecessary stuff from DriverPack before trigger.</p>
