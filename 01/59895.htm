<h2>            Wireless ergonomic keyboard&#40;s&#41; 4000 wreaking havoc with Office 365&#47;2018 apps</h2>
                    <p>I have had two of these keyboards for some time and have loved using them. However, in the past week, one started spontaneously deleted data (emails from outlook, text from Word, Onenote) very rapidly and in large quantity. The only way to stop this is to
 turn off the computer. I swapped the two keyboards with the same result. Downloaded the newest drivers, same result.&nbsp; This does not happen with the laptop keyboard or with a logitech wireless keyboard. I posted a similar question on the Office community before
 I realized this was keyboard specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As deletions are happening, the cursor blinks rapidly between hourglass and pointer, and we are talking about massive and rapid deletions. Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Phil</p>

            run full scans with the most powerful on-demand scanners Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Clean up anything they find, restart PC and then run both scans again until they come up clean.
<br />
<br />Then check System files for damage:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />Since you think it's the keyboard doing this on its own, here's everything to check it over:  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />This could have been caused by Windows Update.  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so we'd want to test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

That's what I've done. This is a Dell XPS 13 (8th gen I7) which works fine either on it own KB or with anything other then the wireless Microsoft KB. The best answer may be just to use another brand, but I really like that KB. Thanks!

<p>Greg, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done pretty much all of the standard options in the past couple of weeks, primarily because of blue screen bad_pool_caller errors occurring when using wired Ethernet with the Dell Thunderbolt dock (the machine is a recent XPS 13). Malwarebytes lives
 on my machine, and I've run DSIM as well as SFC but not adwcleaner. The machine is new, so there are no restore points back to April...I say that knowing that the machine updated Windows almost as soon as I fired it up. Point is that it's "relatively" clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you've mentioned some things new to me, and I am especially incline to blame the 1803 update and to do a clean install. One thing that has me stumped is that I have identical setups from the dock back at home and the office. This and the earlier
 Ethernet blue screens happen ONLY a the office. Please bear with me b/c this is gong to take awhile, and I do earn my living with this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

<h2>            microsoft fix it center</h2>
                    I was trying to figure out whether a problem I'm having with a compucessory optical mouse I'm using was a software problem or the mouse itself is on the fritz. &nbsp;So i downloaded microsoft fix ir center. &nbsp;I have windows 7 starter on an acer aspire one notebook.
 &nbsp;The fix it page is too long for the screen, and when i try to lift it high enough to see and click on the bottom, it snaps back. &nbsp;Is there something i can do about this? &nbsp;I have had the same problem with other utilities.

            You make the window smaller using the box up next to the " X " that closes the window so that you have the "scroll" &nbsp;ability on the window you are trying to view. I've had this problem plenty of times and I understand your logic, the bigger the window
 so it all will fit, but its actually - the smaller the window, the better I can scroll up and down to see it all. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            It didn't work at the time, but thank you all the same. &nbsp;It was the mouse itself that was on the fritz.
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have another problem. &nbsp;When i was trying to figure out whether it was the mouse or the driver, I got a message saying my windows update was not configured to automatically update drivers, and to reconfigure it to do so, but my efforts in the past
 have been to no avail because there appears to be no way toadjust my windows update to automatically update drivers, so any assistance there would be helpful</div>

Whoopee! I've got my games back! Silent Hunter 4 &amp; 5 now run like a champs. After countless hours of trying everything I could of, I was just about to give up on the old games when I read your post ... and bang, it worked. Thanks so much for posting this. (Win

    <title>svchost.exe taking up most of the bandwidth allocation per month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billurwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            svchost.exe taking up most of the bandwidth allocation per month</h2>
                    I have nine copies of svchost.exe running on my machine and one of them seems to be always using up 10-20% of the CPU. Looking at it using my BTsoftware, the active svchost.exe is listening on several ports including 1900 several times and often is sending
 information to my Home Hub and possibly on to the Internet using port 8000. If I stop this process, it rebuilds after a short while and goes back to whatever it was doing. If I look at traffic analysis it is often at 96% of allocation over the last 24 hours.
 Any ideas gratefully accepted.

First, you need to be reasonably sure you're free of malicious software.<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do at least one full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<br />
Then... you start figuring things out if there is something to figure out.<br />
<br />
If you read this article, you will be smarter than the average bear about what goes on with svchost.exe and understand why it is normal to see several svchost processes running in Task Manager<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 SP3 Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I restored my computer to a factory state. According to the information in "Installed Updates" W7 Service Pack 3 is installed on my computer, but when I check the computer info in Properties, it doesn't say Service Pack 3 under the text "Windows
 7 Home Premium...Copyright, etc...". I also can't install Internet Explorer 11 because apparently I SP1 is required but I don't have it installed. I could use some help.</p>
<p>

<p>First of all, thank you very much for your kind answer. Just after posting the question I just realized that it was Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Office, and not Windows, but I didn't know how to delete the question. Finally, I had to install Service Pack
 1 manually&nbsp;since it didn't do it automatically, but everything is ok now. Again thank you very much for your help and sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

    <title>Photos app behaviour with photos on OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xexets  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos app behaviour with photos on OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello! So I am trying to use Photos app to arrange and view my library of photos and videos (about 30,000 files). I have windows 10 latest version, fully updated photos and onedrive app.</p>
<p>Behaviour of the app is erratic at best and I would like to know if someone has understood how Photos app works. Here is what I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If all my photos are on my local hard drive, outside of OneDrive Photos adds them, indexes them, finds people in them etc. so it works fine. However I cannot search for tags (i.e. keywords), because photos does not seem to look into files metadata. So
 far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When all my photos are in OneDrive the onedrive interface can search for tags and places. If the photos are in the main OneDrive Pictures folder Photos app in windows 10 sees them all, always regardless whether I have checked show pictures from my onedrive
 folder, show pictures in the could only, or if I add or remove manually the folder from the list of folders. If the pictures are outside of the pictures folder they appear only if 'show pictures from all onedrive folders' is selected. all right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I use 'on demand' onedrive files: if the pictures are not downloaded, photos app does not index them at all. If they are downloaded photos app pulls&nbsp;<em>some</em> indexing from OneDrive but not all of it. So for instance if I search for 'cat' in the onedrive
 web interface I get 200 results, if I search on the Windows 10 photos app I get maybe 70. In neither case photos app indexes people. People indexing seems to be reserved to photos that are on your harddrive outside of the OneDrive folder, at least for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at the moment I have two identical copies of my library: one is offline on my hard drive outside of the onedrive folder and is indexed normally. The other one is in onedrive, every single file is linked as duplicate within Photos app, and this enables
 me to pull albums from Onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now my question is: why can't I just have all my library in the Pictures folder in OneDrive, keep it always available on my computer and have a fully indexed catalogue? Why do I have to keep two copies of the library to have the best of both worlds? I does
 not make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why does show my OneDrive photos default to ON everytime I restart the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bet I will get an answer from a Microsoft 'technician' asking me to send a screenshot of the problem so they can understand the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have reset the app, uninstalled and reinstalled it, deleted all the possible system files and started from scratch, no matter what I do this seems to be Photos default behaviour...</p>
<p>

            All I can tell you right now is I have observed the same things.&nbsp; I know people indexing won't work if the files are "on demand", because the people index is local per-computer (which seems weird to me, since I have many computers and they all have to
 separately perform this significant CPU processing, which takes forever).

<p>Well, I'm not a lawyer, so be sure to read the terms of use.&nbsp; But my understanding of it is that your files are not subject to any review whatsoever at all, unless you share them. Files you are sharing out of the account are subject to review and you can
 be in trouble if you're found to be hosting/distributing illegal content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as backups, that's easy: the files never leave your hard drive -- sure, there's an&nbsp;<em>extra copy</em> in the cloud, but your copy is still just regular files on your hard drive*.&nbsp; I personally even go one step beyond by continuing to make local backups
 the normal way (I use File History tool built-in to Windows). So I have a local copy inside my PC, on a external backup drive, in the cloud, and also on several other computers that synchronize the same set of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I save literally every file I care about inside my OneDrive folder, even my Desktop is moved inside there, so that I could drop my computer in a lake and be able to use any other computer within 10 minutes of logging in with my same account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Unless you want to. On my Surface Pro, I don't have enough internal drive space to store all 400 GB of my OneDrive content. I can see all those files/folders, but I marked ones I don't use much as "online only files" and the are only available if I have
 a connection. So I do this with old documents (but that's not much space</p>

<p>Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm with @xexets here.&nbsp; Although what I found on one machine was exactly the opposite to his experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got three machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one that works exactly as you would hope is my old Surface Pro 1 (1709),&nbsp;<strong>none</strong> of the pictures are local, they're all up in OneDrive and yet this is the only machine that perfectly indexed and applied facial recognition in a way that
 one would hope.&nbsp; It took a while, but it chugged through all 30K+ images.&nbsp; Power &amp; Sleep changed to "don't sleep and keep the screen on while plugged" in allowed it to keep going overnight.<br />
<br />
My main desktop, less than a year old i5-8400 16GB RAM and a graphics card (also 1709) seems to "time out" and hangs when indexing pictures (after 1220 images, like clockwork).&nbsp; On this machine I've reset the app, deleted using powershell&nbsp;<em>and</em> deleted
 the database file.&nbsp; The only thing that seemed to help was moving images to a non-indexed drive adding information into the metadata and then moving them back into the OneDrive pictures folder.&nbsp; Although that was hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brand new Surface Pro (2017) on the Fast Ring goes through the motions but it stubbornly refuses to show
<strong>any</strong> faces under the People tab.</p>

    <title>Want to use Skype for video chats, why do I have to purchase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daleneibert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to use Skype for video chats, why do I have to purchase credit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am very confused with the new Skype revenue model.&nbsp; Why doesn't Microsoft simply come out with a CLEAR statement as to whether or not Skype can be utilized for skype to skype calls without a payment or credit?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I can see documentation otherwise I am assuming that Skype is leaving customers like myself who have no need to pay for this services as I have multiple phone lines but I would have utilized Skype for video chats with other Skype users whereby we
 could've been advertised to etc.&nbsp; Instead, it appears that we are no longer considered viable clientele.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear:&nbsp; Does the new update as of June 2017 mean that Skype users are now required to pay for credits to use Skype in order to access Skype to skype video chats which do not utilize credits and re considered free?&nbsp; In other words, does this mean that
 in order to utilize Skype at this point in time it requires a user to pay a "non-refundable" credit of $18.53 every 3 mos in order to utilize Skype to Skype video conferencing?&nbsp; Or, am I missing something as I am not able to obtain a new number or move forward
 without paying for credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest &amp; think that MSFT relieve themselves of&nbsp; a giant headache&nbsp; by simply releasing a statement providing clarity on this as I have gone to great lengths to look into this prior to sending this email and any communications from your organization
 are ambiguous on this subject at best.&nbsp; I am highly appreciative of your response and clarification.</p>

</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Does the new update as of June 2017 mean that Skype users are now required to pay for credits to use Skype in order to access Skype to skype video chats which do not utilize credits and re considered free?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Skype-to-Skype calls (calls from one Skype account to another Skype account whether audio or video calls) are still free anywhere in the world. You
<strong>do not </strong>need to pay an amount for a service such as Skype-to-Skype calls which is offered for
<strong>free</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Skype will only ask users to pay for premium services such as sending SMS, making calls to landline and/or mobile numbers, purchases of credits or subscriptions, calls being forwarded to a phone number, etc.&nbsp;</p>

hi all</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
finally my problem solved by doing below notes:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
1- I found that only windows 8 64bit can be install in my device and later versions could not install because the version of bios was old. so i should upgrade my bios.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
2- I tested many tools for creating bootable usb flash in order to installing windows 8, but only one tool called Rufus with below partition scheme able to do that:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp; "MBR partition scheme for UEFI computer"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
3- after i install windows 8, im go to vaio support web site and download the bios uptate and then update my device bios. after that i could install newer version of windows and everything was ok.</p>

<h2>            How to stop windows opening behind taskbar and sidebar</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering if there was a way to stop windows from opening up behind the taskbar and sidebar in Vista SP2, i currently have my taskbar on the right side about the same width as my sidebar, which is on the left side of the screen. Both have been set
 to keep on top of other windows. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Even if it meant having the desktop picture shrunk so it fit perfectly into the remaining space.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, is there a way to have a moving desktop background???</p>

            Quirks of the operating system, I think. Having the taskbar on the side at least gives you a chance to rescue a program window. I run the taskbar double wide&nbsp;at the top, and some programs insist on opening umderneath it. I have to resize the taskbar if
 I want to be able to move the window anywhare. Happens in Win 7 too.. <br />

Dreamscene animated backgrounds were for Vista Ultimate only, but Stardock has something called Desk Scapes which will run on other versions of Vista, but you have to pay for it.

<h2>            Window Media Player stuck in background</h2>
                    Sometimes when I try to play a bad file WMP will indicate it can't play it and give the option to end. Some of these times it seems to be stuck in the background. I will try to play another file which will start without WMP opening. I can then start the
 player and the file I have started will be there running. I can end the player and the file keeps playing. The only way to clear out the player is to restart the system. Is there a task I can kill or another option available rather than a restart?

            <p><span>Hi Denmarks,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for visiting answers.microsoft.com forums</span></p>
<p><span>When you try and play a bad file with WMP, it will probably become unresponsive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only suggestion I have is you can use Ctrl, Alt &amp; Del to open Task Manager.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In there you should be able to find Windows Media Player under applications and you can use the button End Task to stop the application.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you cannot end the application, you can go to the Processes tab in Task Manager and end the process called Wmplayer.exe.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both of these options should work and avoid a system restart. </span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>

            Hi Mary.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; DIsplay and set Change the Size dropdown menu to 100%.  
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />Then check the Screen Resolution at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display is Recommended.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Original Title: Desktop XP. Can't connect to internet. Ethernet drivers not installed.</p>
<p>Have recently acquired a desktop XP. Have checked on Device Manager. Under Other Devices, Ethernet Controller has a&nbsp; highlighted ? mark and double clicking reveals that drivers are not installed (Code 28). Have tried reinstalling and also rollback but no
 drivers available on computer. The network adapter is a 1394 if that info is of any use. I can provide details under properties if that also is of any use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working from a Windows 7 laptop.</p>

            Hi MadameL'Epouvantail ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />First, please make sure that this is a legitimate email from Skype by checking out this link:-
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA330/how-do-i-know-that-an-email-is-really-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA330/how-do-i...</a>
<br />
<br />Secondly, Skype version 7 has been discontinued a while ago, so you do not need to worry about changing anything.
<br />
<br />If you notice the email is fraudulent, please block it to avoid future issues.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Hi Madame,
<br />
<br />You do not need to do anything, you can just bin that Email. . .
<br />
<br />If that is a legitimate Email, it is being sent from the servers automatically, Microsoft over the last few days, have closed down the infrastructure behind version 7.x of Skype and the Emails will have been sent automatically, by the system
<br />
<br />Likewise, even if that is not a legitimate Email. you an bin that . . .

            <p>I suspect you used some password cracking tool to fix your original problem. It probably damaged the registry file (the SAM) that stores all passwords. Here are a couple of options to repair the damage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the FAQs of the password cracking program.</li><li>Use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before you cracked the password, then use a better method to reset the password.</li></ul>
<p>When finished, plan ahead a little and create, test and document a spare admin account, same as you have a spare house key. This will save you an enormous amount of trouble.</p>
