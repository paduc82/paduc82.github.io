<h2>            Upgrading Windows Vista to Windows 10</h2>
                    Is it possible to upgrade Windows Vista to Windows 10 still? I assume there will be a cost (which is fine). but is it cheaper than buying windows 10 outright?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal opinion is that you buy a newer machine as Vista&nbsp;did come on machines with now older hardware that may not meet later operating systems requirement/standards..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no free upgrade from Vista to 7, 8.1 or 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7.</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer sells 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>

    <title>Sony Bravia does not select 3d &#38;quot&#59;Side by - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sony Bravia does not select 3d &#38;quot&#59;Side by side&#38;quot&#59; for xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased 3d glasses for my Sony Bravia. 3d movies work flawless through the PS3. No problems at all.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>However, on the 360 some games require "Side by Side" to activate the 3d properly. Some examples are Crysis 1 and Gears Of War 3.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So I set the game to "side by side" in the game 3d menu. At that point I should be able to select "side by side" on my tv. It does not give me this option if I am hooked to the 360. I tried component and HDMI. Same results. Even the imanual on the tv says
 to just select 3d then "side by side" but it is not working. Any ideas?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I tried this on the PS3 and it gives me the option for "side by side" but not on the 360. I even used the exact same HDMI cables.</p>

<p>I have a later model, the Sony KDL-55HX850, with a similar 3D setup menu. My 360 is connected to my TV's HDMI 2 input via a string of devices,&nbsp;first through a Monoprice HDMI switch then to a Yamaha YSP-4000 sound projector and finally the TV. I can enable
 3D in Gears of War 3, then set the TV to Side By Side mode. It doesn't seem to have any restrictions on options (I can choose over/under and simulated as well).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a game that require auto-detection (Halo Anniversary), my setup fails.&nbsp;To test, I plugged&nbsp;the console directly into the TV and rebooted it. After that, the console detected a 3D TV and Halo Anniversary allowed&nbsp;3D to be enabled. No changes were required
 on the TV side - the TV automatically went into 3D mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming you have your 360 plugged directly into your TV, go to Settings, System, Console Settings, Display, and make sure you see 3D TV and TV Size listed. If not, make sure you have Display Discovery enabled, though I should note that none of that was
 required for Gears of War 3, and I know from historical testing that Black Ops doesn't care, either.</p>

<p>I tried 3 games last night in 3d.</p>
<p>1. GOW3 (side by side from tv would not work)</p>
<p>2. Crysis 1 (side by side from tv would not work)</p>
<p>3. Black ops 2 &nbsp;(Only option available was "Simulated 2d to 3d)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So I dont even think Black Ops 2 worked in 3d either since I only had the option of Simulated 2d to 3d. &nbsp; What is Black ops 2 supposed to be set at on the tv in the 3d menu?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Any suggestions to get the "side by side" option to pop up while playing the 360?? &nbsp;Side by side is available when I have the PS3 plugged in. &nbsp;But never becomes available for the 360. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I own Halo CE Annersary but havent tried it yet. &nbsp;Doesnt sound like I will have much with that either.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I will check out your other suggestion about the settings tonight. "<em>go to Settings, System, Console Settings, Display, and make sure you see 3D TV and TV Size listed. If not, make sure you have Display Discovery enabled"&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; Do I check these settings
 on the tv or the 360?</p>

<p>Those settings are on the 360 itself. 3D TV and TV size do not show up if the 360 cannot communicate properly with the TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just took my Yamaha YSP-4000 out of the path between the 360 and the TV. The 360 now properly registers the TV and Halo Anniversary works, so it looks like my sound projector is the anti-3D culprit. No big deal as the HX850 line can output 5.1 sound from
 the TV to the sound projector over optical.</p>

<p>Ahhh ok I know for sure I have never seen "3d tv or Tv size" show up. &nbsp; &nbsp;Or at least not with the component cables. However when I tried with the HDMI cords it did show a lot of different sizes like 1280x720 and a lot of others but thats all I noticed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I did fail to mention above that I am running a Sewell HDMI splitter between the tv and the 360 / PS3. The splitter and 3d still work fine with the PS3 but obviously something isnt working with the 360. &nbsp;It doesnt seem like my tv recognizes anything 3d with
 the 360 plugged in. &nbsp;I dont think the splitter has anything to do with it but I guess its worth a try.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for firmware update. &nbsp;I have never plugged this tv into the internet in the year that I have had it. Purchased January 2012.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was always afraid a firmware update might mess something up. &nbsp;I guess I could try that if you think its a good idea. &nbsp;Maybe
 it will help the tv recognize the 360. &nbsp;The bottom line is that this tv does not recognize anything 3d from the 360. &nbsp; But it does recognize the PS3 in 3d. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would first take the HDMI switch out of the path, see if that changes things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, I'd try a Firmware Update. I updated mine shortly after I bought it. The process was painless. If you're still within your 1 yr warranty can't hurt too much to try.</p>

<p>I will try bypassing the HDMI splitter tonight. &nbsp;Maybe the 360 does not like that splitter but the PS3 doesnt mind. &nbsp; My other very important&nbsp;question is.... &nbsp;Will 3D even work at all if I am using Component cables? &nbsp; Or does 3d only work with HDMI??? "Simulated&nbsp;2d
 to 3d" seems to work a&nbsp;little. But&nbsp;if 3D doesnt even work with component cables then I will only test it with the HDMI cables. &nbsp; I kept using the Component cables with the 360 because visualy I have never seen a difference between HDMI and Component.</p>

<p>Ahh ok so it appears that could be part of the major problem. The fact that I was doing almost all my testing with the component cables. &nbsp;I think we are getting somewhere now. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1. Sooo tonight I will test ONLY using the HDMI cable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I will bypass the splitter right away so its not part of the equation. &nbsp;Then at that point it should recognize the 360. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Oh and I will also check the settings you mentioned above for the 360 to see if it recognizes the 3d tv. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>4. If that doesnt work then I will try the firmware. &nbsp; </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your quick replies and helpful advice. &nbsp;I will make sure to follow up with this thread tomorrow after all my testing tonight.

<h2>            CPU Stuck at 100 Percent Load Until Power Plan is Changed</h2>
                    <p>My CPU automatically goes to 100 percent load at startup. This issue is resolved for a short time if I change my power plan to a different plan. After a few days my CPU goes back to 100 percent on the new power plan, causing me to switch to a new plan I
 haven't used before.</p>

</p><p>This issue is causing me to duplicate a plan I haven't used before multiple times, so that I can switch to them as the previous plans I use get "infected" by the 100% CPU issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically this is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use plan 1 until CPU hits 100% &gt;&gt;&gt; Switch to plan 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Plan 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; Duplicate plan 3 for future use since I haven't used it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plan 2 stuck at 100% CPU &gt;&gt;&gt; Switch to plan 3 duplicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Plan 3 duplicate &gt;&gt;&gt; Duplicate plan 3 again, to switch to later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to go to the advanced power options for each of the plans to "Restore plan defaults" but that button is greyed out, even if I select the link "Change settings that are currently unavailable".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Again&nbsp; in the trace it does not appear you were having the problem as described.&nbsp; From your snips I can see that HWMonitor is using 34+% and driving desktop manager to use 21%..&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect what it happening is HWMonitor is insinuating itself so deep in
 the OS it i hiding the usage from WPR.&nbsp; Have you tried un-installing it?&nbsp; Does this issue happen in safe mode?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is obviously something unusual going on and since WPR is not seeing it (first time I have even seen this) I am not sure how much use it is going to be.&nbsp;

<p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with HWMonitor uninstalled the issue still presented itself. This problem was going on before I installed any additional monitoring software. I installed the additional software to get "second opinions" on my resource usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since HWMonitor and other monitoring software were reporting that the CPU was at normal idle percentages and task manager was reporting 100%, I assumed that it was an issue with Task Manager showing false usage reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this may have been due to a program that I had installed since I received my Elgato HD60 Pro. Possibly a version of XSplit or maybe the drivers for the Elgato device. I think one of those programs were causing some hidden power setting to change
 that I couldn't easily control or change back to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed 64bit and 32bit drivers for the Elgato HD60 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a system reset which has returned all of my power plans to normal, no longer causing 100% usage. If the CPU spikes again I can narrow the issue down faster since I have only installed the bare minimum programs to get me through the week. After
 this week, if the problem does not present itself; I shall reinstall my other programs slowly just in case the dual driver installation was not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have not reinstalled XSplit and will not, as I am using a different streaming/recording software as of now since it is compatible with the Elagato HD60 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help and sorry for the long explanation. I will post in this thread if any problems return.</p>

    <title>What do these registry errors mean&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What do these registry errors mean&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use ccleaner and as you probably know this has a tool to fix registry issues. I've been going through and happily clicking 'fix all' without really thinking about it like a proper numpty. :) I recently ended up having an issue where the PC was taking up
 to 5 minutes to get to the login screen when I turn it on, whereas before it would usually be less than 15 seconds. I restored a few of the ccleaner registry back ups and now the problem is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: can you help me work out which registry error is the one that causes it, or which ones I could fix safely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to mess with the registry more as I don't really understand it. But I am guessing ideally I should probably try and fix some of the registry issues, if I can do so while avoiding 'fixing' the one that was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC my partner's old custom build running windows 10, so I can't provide a model number or anything really, but if you need any spec details I'll do my best. If this is in the wrong category let me know and I'll move it. Thank you.</p>

            <p><em>I use ccleaner and as you probably know this has a tool to fix registry issues.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This is not quite correct. CCleaner has a tool that&nbsp;<strong>tries</strong>&nbsp;to fix what it&nbsp;<strong>claims</strong>&nbsp;are registry issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I don't want to mess with the registry more as I don't really understand it.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Good thinking. At the same time you should not let CCleaner mess with any of the more than 500,000 entries that the average registry has. It cannot possibly know what the correct values should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner is good at finding countless irrelevant registry errors and making a big noise about them in order to impress users, e.g. list registry keys that point at non-existing files. It's like your diary having an address for a deceased person.
 So what? Is your diary corrupted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you allow CCleaner to fix things then it is a game of luck. Either the there is no visible effect or you end up with a damaged registry. The registry restore function is the only function I would use but then the native System Restore facility
 will do this too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I would never use any registry cleaning or optimising tool. They are a waste of money and sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>

            <p>Honestly, the best option is not to use a Registry Cleaner, they can brick your system as easily as they do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without an in-depth knowledge of your system, the software installed on it, the software that has been uninstalled, it would be virtually impossible to say which registry entry(s) is causing this issue . . .</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Settings Missing After Shut Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Settings Missing After Shut Down</h2>
                    <p>I did Shut Down end of day yesterday. &nbsp;This morning when I started my laptop and clicked the Windows icon on the task bar, only All Apps and Power were there (and my Profile at the top). &nbsp; I did a Restart &nbsp;(using the right click of the Windows icon) and
 all is now OK. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that Shut Down is flaky? &nbsp; Problem was not seen the day before. &nbsp;I notice the laptop starts faster than before, and that is a big plus, but perhaps something got missed.</p>

                    <p>Old title: Freezing on Hp Pavilion 15-ab257tx</p>
<p>Windows: Windows 10 (Anniversery update)</p>
<p>Laptop:&nbsp;hp pavilion 15-ab257tx</p>
<p>Last updated: 16/08/2016</p>
<p>All updates (including device manager, hp updates, Windows update)</p>
<p>Problem: My laptop is randomly freezing. First, the internet/wifi doesn't work properly. Secondly everything becomes unresponsive from the screen, applications to the buttons and touchpad. The screen just stops and does not change. Lastly, it makes a noise.
 (If i'm playing League of Legends it doesn't freeze instantly after the internet problem, it happens a few seconds later.)</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It's not obvious what exactly causing the issue. But most of the problems in windows 10 arises with the incompatible drivers or applications. Suggest you to check and install all latest drivers for Windows 10 from Manufacturer's
 website. Most probably this would fix the issue. If your PC is running with any third party Antivirus software, then try to disable it for a moment and restart your PC to see if that is the cause.</span></p>

 to temporarily disable it for any purpose, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

</p><p>Let me confirm that all services will not be running always. They will be triggered on demand. Suggest you to check by keeping your device in Clean Boot state to see if everything works normal. This might give us the clue on the root cause.</p>

            <p>Hey Randy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. It appears that having your own disk and not paying for something in the game is a thing of the past unless you have or use and older version of windows. The XP version was the last version that could run them as far as I have found.
 If you found something, send me the info too. Thanks........David</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT: Dec '17 - This thread would have been closed long ago on most forums. Four new version updates have</strong></p>
<p><strong>been released since the OP (1511, 1607, 1703, 1709).&nbsp; Those updates have affected gaming issues in different ways.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone having issues with old games would do better to start a new thread
</strong>(if nothing below fixes your problem) <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Two enduring issues with Win10 and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disk based games</span> (focus of OP) are ...</p>
<p><em>-<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> DRM Blocking</span></em> (details in my post at
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread-- </a><strong>]<br />
</strong>- Verifying that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Legacy Components &amp; Direct Play</em></span> are enabled in
<em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off</em>.&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The games in the OP I believe had plenty of issue on Win7 64bit as well. There were a lot of threads about</p>
<p>AOEII in particular. There may be fixes for most, if not all of them. If not, yeah! XP is the surest thing for retro.</p>
<p>- Civ3 (2001) maybe, maybe not, but Sim&nbsp; City4 (2003) <em>should</em> be OK, on Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I've looked closely at a number of games, and have at least loaded a save for a quick run from around</p>
<p>100 of the games that had been installed&nbsp; on Win7 before the Win10 upgrade. </p>
<p>Tweaks have been needed for many. Mostly just redoing a games graphics settings, as can happen</p>
<p>when changing hardware or OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[EDIT: </em><del>I forgot that Hidden and Dangerous 2 will not run on Win10, and I've just found that two games from</del></p>
<p><del>Steam that I thought were running, are not - <em>Oddworld: Munchs Oddysee</em>, and
<em>Abe's Exodus.</em></del> </p>
<p><del>The first of the series - <em>Abe's Oddysee</em>, and last -&nbsp; <em>Strangers Wrath</em> both run
</del></p>
<p><del>(Munch's Oddysee can be coaxed into running, but it's fickle). ]</del></p>
<p><em>EDIT: 18 Apr 16 - </em></p>
<p>I got all of these games running after this post. The 1511 update was helpful with a lot of games that</p>
<p>had issues when using a high DPI desktop setting .</p>
<p>The only problem with Hidden and Dangerous 2 now is it will only run in a Window, but this may be</p>
<p>more to do with the recent Nvidia drivers ? ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[ EDIT: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Batman Arkham City</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disk based version</span> would not transfer the save games to Win10. I tried&nbsp; repairing (ended up reinstalling)</p>
<p>because the game would not connect to GFWL and saves could not be made.</p>
<p>At least it's the GOTY ed. Mine was the original. Some small consolation. There is a limited number of GFWL games that</p>
<p>Steam will accept the disk based key for. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Civ 5 could be having a DRM conflict.&nbsp; The DRM issue was also there with Win7. It's just that Win7 did not block
</p>
<p>the driver after installing.</p>
<p>Some DRM from '04-'06 is not compatible with <em>any</em> 64bit OS .<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">StarForce and Tages
</span></em>in particular.</p>
<p>While I have not reinstalled all games (and got no response when I asked if games were not installing because</p>
<p>of the DRM blocking on another thread) that came with problematic DRM, I did reinstall Col McRea 05,
</p>
<p>which had a notorious DRM.</p>
<p>As with Win7, the game did install on Win10, but would not run without using a noCD fix/hack.</p>
<p>- The majority of popular games from these bad old days of DRM do have noCD fixes available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[EDIT:</span> Dec '17 -&nbsp; version <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
update 1709</span> brought back an issue with older games not fitting the screen correctly.</p>
<p>To counter this you need to use <em>Compatibility</em> option - <em>Override High DPI Scaling Behavior.</em>Note that Windows will force this option on many games that don't need it, while missing those that do. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[EDIT</span> Dec '17 - Screen scaling returned to graphics card control panel with
</p>
<p>that use a resolution that is native to 4:3 aspect ratio in Full Screen as there was with earlier Win10 versions ]</p>
<p><del>-When the scaling was done via Nvidia/AMD drivers in Win7 there was no such (rarely) problem.Also, while I prefer a 4:3 aspect ratio when playing games with a 4:3 resolution, others are unhappy they can't
</del><del>play in full wide screen when using a low resolution, as could be done on Win7.</del></p>
<p><del>The Windows knows all approach is not helpful.</del></p>
<p><del><em>EDIT: 18 Apr16 - </em>While a lot of people are still unhappy about the way Win10 does the screen scaling
</del></p>
<p><del>and does not allow them to run games using a 4:3 aspect ratio resolution in full screen
</del></p>
<p><del>(leaving black bars on the sides), the DPI issue was fixed with the 1511 update.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><del>-&nbsp; Games are also more prone to crash when launching or closing ( just a redundant error</del></p>
<p><del>message to the effect the game has to close, after you quit a game. Well, duh! ) in Win10.</del></p>
<p><em>EDIT: 18 Apr 16-&nbsp;</em> Not the problem it was before the 1511 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I've seen no gaming performance improvement, I have seen no loss in performance either.</p>
<p>I have used and older Nvidia driver (347.25) as well as the most recent (355.60) for my GTX770,</p>
<p>still get the same performance as with Win7. </p>

            Wimdows 10 is a joke. You loose a lot programs you need for older games. If you want to get your older games to work delete Windows 10 and never re in stall it. this is stupid. Never have hated a windows so much.

    <title>Windows 10 installation does not recognize second hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian_j_870  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installation does not recognize second hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7, I had a system with three hard drives: a small SSD, a 4TB internal SATA drive that was set up as drive E in a single 4TB spanned volume, and a 2TB SATA drive that was set up as drive F.&nbsp; The system and specifically the drives were working
 fine right up until I attempted to install Windows 10.&nbsp; I have now installed Windows 10 and the installation went without any errors, but the second drive no longer appears (though the smaller third drive does).&nbsp; I have read various answers here and followed
 the instructions.&nbsp; I have run hardware troubleshooting which required a restart but did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I have seen posts suggesting that I need to assign a drive letter, but that option is not available because disk management shows the drive as failed.&nbsp;
 The image below shows what I see in Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know how to turn this disk back into a single 4TB volume that is recognized in Windows 10, without losing the data that is stored on it, or I will have to revert to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the above description, I understand you are unable to detect the second hard drive on your computer after upgrading to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer was able to recognize the second hard disk before Windows 10 upgrade, there are chances of your current hard disk drives being incompatible with the upgraded operating system.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Update the disk drivers manually from
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, I have already tried this option.&nbsp; When I try to update the driver software, Windows 10 searches online and then reports that the best driver match is already installed.&nbsp; Therefore no changes are made and the disk is still inaccessible.</p>

    <title>Alt&#43;Tab failing in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rj user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alt&#43;Tab failing in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    This just started with Win 8.1.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Assume Alt+Shift+Tab also for all issues in addition to Alt+Tab.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes:</div>
<div>Alt+Tab - nothing happens.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes:</div>
<div>Alt+Tab - switches to next window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes:</div>
<div>Alt+Tab - switches to next window and minimizes all other windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Never:</div>
<div>Alt+Tab shows the menu of windows through which I will cycle by each press of Tab.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is happening only on my account; it does not happen on the other account, a "girlfriend account" that I haven't made into an admin yet, to test whether that causes the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The thing that never happens now is the most important part of the Alt+Tab feature.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Will post if I find a fix.</div>

            Hi VV, cool initials.
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, you forgot to tell me to make sure the computer is turned on, and that the monitor is connected to the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>* I rebooted with all services save for MS services set to manual startup, then I didn't manually start them after booting. PROBLEM CONTINUES</div>
<div><br />
<div>* I ran the MS security scan in your link. PROBLEM EXACERBATED (I think it was coincidental side effect, but TAB + click_anywhere_on_the_screen behaved as Alt+Tab is misbehaving; rebooted to fix)</div>
<div><br />
<div>* McAfree is running on their recommended schedule, which is apparently "forever". McAfee reports that in over a year it has blocked two malicious items. PROBLEM CONTINUES</div>
<div><br />
<div>* I promoted the girlfriend account to admin, and the problem does not exist there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>* I changed the background screen to one of the factory themes from MS that has just one image. PROBLEM CONTINUES (I've installed some themes from MS and was using those)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Is there an app that can delta services started, their settings, which versions of stuff each are using (usually in the registry), between two accounts? That I won't have to pay for? Or build. Again.</div>
        </p>

            Fixed. I disabled Actual Multiple Monitors (v. 8, which is too high to mean anything other than the version that matches Windows 8). Their features went away, and so did the glitch in switching between windows with Alt+Tab.
<div><br />
<div>If I didn't rely on Alt+Tab for rapid navigation around my desktop, and visualization of the moment, I would have kept AMM for now.<br />
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Before I disabled AMM at startup:</div>
<div>They have various configuration doohickeys, many of which are key mappings. I didn't find any that mapped Alt+Tab, but I disabled all of them (did not reboot) and that did not solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Current resolution: Disable Actual Multiple Monitors at startup.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Language problem on Xbox App for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thatsnake023454  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language problem on Xbox App for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My system was in English at the beginning, then I wanted to play Prey in Chinese, I am certain that Prey supports Chinese as it shows in the game description, but there is no language option in the game. I assume that the language in the game is the same
 as the system language, so I changed my system language into Chinese, and it worked. The Xbox App is still in English though, the game is in Chinese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today the language of the Xbox App suddenly changed into a language I can't read, probably Arab, my system is still in Chinese (non-Unicode as well and UTF-8), and the game is also still in Chinese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that it was working just fine before, and the change of the language just happened out of blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bruce</p>

<p>They can't answer your questrion</p>
<p>but I can</p>
<p>because this app don't have Simp Chinese support but have Trad Chinese but it doesn't fallback to english if you don't have language pack but Arab..............................(so strange)</p>
<p>so all you need is add an Trad Chiese language pack ( for example : taiwan )&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have an email that failed to send in Windows Live Mail and it's causing problems in sending mail.<br />
<br />
I keep getting the message to delete the email, but I can't find it to delete. It's not in the Sent folder, nor the Drafts, it's not in the Inbox - I don't have an 'Outbox' . I've looked everywhere for it and can't find it - but if I don't delete it I'll continue
 to have problems.<br />
<br />
Delete the photo email, create a new one, and try to send it again.<br />

Can anyone help me please?? I wasn't even sure which Category to choose as Windows Live Mail wasn't given as an option - if I posted in the wrong one can you please direct me to the right category please.

<p>Hi Kim Tiw,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I haven't tried to uninstall Windows Live, I have some emails I don't want to lose and don't know how to save them - there are quite a few. If I uninstall, then I will lose them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that was the second place I looked - first was in the 'sent' folder. I couldn't find the offending email anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from using CCleaner to clean my cache and to run the repair option on my pc, I tried to Google for help. But I couldn't get the answers that would solve my problem. I don't use OneDrive, and while I'm not familiar with it, one suggestion was to look
 there, but I couldn't find it there either. A few suggestions were to make changes in the registry, and I'm not comfortable doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I knew how to save all the emails I don't want to lose, then I would try uninstalling and reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you </p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are brilliant!!!!!&nbsp; Yes, I'm definitely using Windows Live . The Storage Folders and the Outbox weren't showing under my account - a few family members also have accounts , and I didn't check clearly enough after the last one on the list. I feel so silly
 now. As I have an Inbox, Sent folder, Drafts Folder, etc I just assumed that the Outbox should also have been there.
<br />
<br />
I found the offending email and finally deleted it!! Thank you ever so much. I unnecessarily bought and paid an alternative email program that I wasn't too happy with, but was better than Outlook - I don't like Outlook. I'm an old Outlook Express user and was
 totally happy with that until Microsoft got rid of it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again - now I can go back to using my emails without all the problems.</p>

<h2>            How to update from Windows 8.1 Enterprise &#40;MSDN update from Windows 7 Italian&#41; to some Windows 10 &#40;even not Enterprise&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I updated, some years ago,&nbsp;a Windows 7 PC (used for development), Italian version,&nbsp;first to&nbsp;Windows 8 Enterprise (from MSDN), I suppose Italian iso too, and then to the Windows 8.1 (from MSDN).</p>
<p>Now I tried to upgrade, always from an MSDN iso, to Windows 10 but, running the setup, it is disabled the choice "keep personal files and apps", allowing only to choose the option "Keep personal files only".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all it is not clear to me if only the app will be delete in this case as written or, as I suppose, also all the desktop application (e.g. Visual Studio, Photoshop).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover I wonder how can I update to Windows 10 keeping both my personal files and apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is the need to use an Italian version of the iso (as it was for Windows 8 update, being the initial Windows 7 an Italian version (even though I have set as SO language English sice the beginning)? If so, I found in the MSDN only the
</p>
<p><em>Windows 10 (Multiple Editions) (x64) - DVD (English-United Kingdom)</em></p>
<p><em>Windows 10 N (Multiple Editions) (x64) - DVD (English)</em></p>
<p>and not an Italian one.</p>
<p>Should I use :</p>
<p><em>Windows 10 Language Interface Pack (x64) - DVD (Multiple Languages)</em> ???</p>
<p>or, because now it is a Windows 8.1 Enterprise,</p>
<p><em>Windows 10 Enterprise N (x64) - DVD (English)</em></p>
<p>even it was an update from Windows 7 Italia?</p>
<p>

            Hi Chaz, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It's possible that a driver reinstall would help, but first, try pressing the keyboard shortcut Windows Key+P. This should bring up external monitor display settings, and you can choose what type of display you'd like, whether mirroring or extended desktop.
<br />
<br />You can also try updating your tablet's drivers. Here's the link:

<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi Chaz.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I had the same problem with a Lenovo laptop and it was a dead HDMI port.  The way to test this is if it Monitor will connect to another PC, and then if another monitor will connect to the Lenovo.  
<br />
<br />It should be plug and play.  That said if there is too much disparity in the Screen Resolution for a tablet to a monitor it could not display.  So try different screen resolutions in Settings &gt; Display.  
<br />
<br />Also Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can contact HP Support as their Support to get it connected or find out why not, even replace it if it's past store warranty limit, is included for the first year.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            INF file not found error when installing a network printer</h2>
                    I have a laptop operating Windows 7 Professional . Out of the box I was able to add a network printer without difficulty. About 2 weeks ago I had to do I factory reinstallation since that time when I tried to add my network printer again I get "INF file
 not found error". It worked before perfectly . It states to contact the brother site to get the right file. I have done this wihout success. Since the problem started with the factory reinstall I suspect the problem has something to do with a file missing.
 I have another laptop same operating software laptop and memory that connects fine The only difference is that I had to reinstall the factory image on the one that doesn't work.. please advise

            I had talked to paid support yesterday and apparantly there is a problem with my INF file for my printer. The problem is present on thetwo computers that I had to reinstall the factory image about 2 weeks ago. The3se laptops are not directly attached to
 the printer (local) The printer is attached to a desktop that is a part of my work network. My acces to the printer is via an access point into a switch. The laptops are fully networked into the desktop that has the printer attached. The desktop is running
 Window XP Professoinal and the Laptops are running Windows 7 Professional. Both Computers belong to the same work group. The printer is a Brother MFC 8220. The error message I get when trying to add the printer wirelessly is the "INF file can not be found".
 I have tried to browse for it without success. The technician I had spoken to yesterday told me it was not there for whatever reason. She suggested and I have performed check disk /r which revealed no errors. I do have a laptop (same make model and setup)
 that is able to install the printer I want and print to the same. The only difference is that I did not have to reinstall teh factory image on this one. I might also state that when these laptops were new (out of the box) they were able to add (install) the
 printer without difficulty. The problem started with the reinstall of the operating system. Thank you..&nbsp; I tried the printer troubleshoot several times before I contacted you. I have been working on this for about 2 weeks,,

<p><strong><span>Hi sailnsam,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
1. What is the correct error code you are getting – 0x8007006 or 0x80070005?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. When exactly do you get this error code?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Which update are you trying to install?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4. Does the update you are trying to install apply to your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If there seems to be a possible virus you can run an online virus scan and then check. You may refer to the below
 link to perform the virus scan –<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 has lost all my settings and started to look as XP</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new laptop with Windows 7 (64bit). I am about to install software I need for work and personalize the settings. Everything worked until now, when the following happened.</p>
<p>- I installed some software (nothing special, e.g a legacy communication software (of trusted source) )</p>
<p>- I rebooted the computer</p>
<p>- All my taskbar and toolbar settings are lost (they are disappeared). The button (which is at the place of start button of XP) changed effectively to start button (it looks like the start button of XP). The translucent window headers changed to non translucent
 ones (as I am used to in XP). The taskbar/toolbar settings won't save any more (even if I save, they go back to a previous version)</p>
<p>How can I switch back to "Windows 7" and get back my settings? What could have caused this strange behavior?</p>

<p>I've done this before on my own to just see if I liked it better. I didn't so I went back to the Windows 7 Look. In your case there are few different scenarios that can cause this.</p>
<p>1. Your theme has changed without your consent.- You can fix this by <strong>right clicking</strong> on your<strong> desktop</strong> and going to<strong> personalize</strong> . Change your theme to one you have saved or using the default Windows 7 theme
 labeled<strong> "Windows 7"</strong> . From here you can simply add your pictures to customize your desktop backgrounds.</p>
<p>2. Your Visual Effect have been changed to <strong>"Adjust for Best Performance"</strong> .</p>
<p>Open the <strong>"Start" </strong>menu and <strong>right click</strong> on<strong> Computer</strong> . Go to<strong> Properties</strong> .</p>
<p>Near the top right of this window you should see <strong>"Advanced System Settings"</strong> , click it.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. Under <strong>Performance</strong> click<strong> Settings</strong> .</p>
<p>From here (depending on your graphics card) choose either <strong>"Let Windows choose whats best for my computer"</strong> or<strong> "Adjust for best Appearance</strong> ". Click<strong> OK</strong> .</p>
<p>3. Lastly your graphics card driver. &lt;- Unlikely</p>
<p>This is not as likely to have happened by just installing a program but, it is not unheard of. Windows 7 will revert to that older look if somehow your driver is damaged and windows is still trying to allow you to use your computer. If you uninstall or damage
 your driver (ex Installing a new graphics card) your computer may be using on-board graphics not giving you the ability to use some of Windows 7's nicer features such as Transparency and Aero Peek.</p>
<p>Again this is not as likely but if the other 2 suggestions above to not alleviate your issues try reinstalling your graphics card driver.</p>
<p>http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx -&gt; For ATI Radeon</p>
<p>http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us -&gt; For Nvidia</p>
<p>If you are unsure of what graphics card you have click your <strong>Start Menu</strong> go to the search box and type<strong> Device Manager</strong> press enter. Click the arrow next to<strong> Display Adapters</strong> .</p>
<p>A drop down should come up showing you your graphics card. Go to one of the websites above to update or roll back your drivers.</p>

<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged
 and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report
 at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally
 Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer
 was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important
 and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X randomly disconnects to a wired network</h2>
                    <p>Have the same setup as my previous Xbox One, but in the last couple of months my Xbox One X randomly disconnects from Xbox Live, loses its network connection and requires a power down to get back, and even that doesn’t always happen. Appears like the network
 card is faulty as nothing has changed and infact I swapped out the entire wired components inc new router...same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoying as its random, fine all day one day...next day 10 times!</p>
<p>I have no special config and reset pretty much everything.</p>

<p>Hello Xbox, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to reset the router and modem </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Xbox &gt;Settings</p>
<p>2. Network</p>
<p>3. Network settings</p>
<p>4. Go offline/ shut down console.</p>
<p>5. Turn off router and modem for 2 or 5mins (unplug power cable from devices)</p>
<p>6. Turn on devices and test all network connections.</p>
<p>(you can also test other ports on the router with a different Ethernet cable)</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Should that not work I do recommend <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Port forward</a></p>
<p>(Either sign into your router and set up these ports or contact your internet provider)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helps.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
