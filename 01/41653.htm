<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Unfortunately, have tried this link before coming to this page for help. I went till here:</p>
<p>
To run these networking commands in a command prompt window
</p><p>and first step worked</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh winsock reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li></ul>
<p>but none of the steps after this worked:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh int ip reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /release</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /renew</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /flushdns</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span></li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>it said was unsuccessful to complete reset.</span></p>

Hi,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Apologies, for my late response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Problem is still there. I have tried all the steps including uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling them. I think if I give you a brief background it may help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My computer is what you call an assembled one with majority parts from ASUS (motherboard, graphics card, wireless card etc.). I updated to Windows 10 a while back and it has been working fine. Only issue I had for last month or two was that it was not letting
 me install new apps or update existing especially Netflix one. I didn't pay attention to it. About six months ago, I updated my modem/router and had no problems.</p>
<p>
<span>Recently, I relocated and had to go with a different Internet provider as old one did not provide to new address. The new provider supply their own router/modem (Telstra). I set up the new connection through my Mobile as per steps
 provided along with the new router. I did not have my computer with me at the time. When I got my computer, I tried to connect it to the new router. The computer shows my router in the wireless list and connects to to but shows no internet. But if you use
 google chrome or microsoft edge they connect to internet even though the symbol at the bottom shows no connection. This, to me,&nbsp;</span><span>shows there is a connection and some software issue is telling windows that there is none. As
 I use MS Office 365 especially MS Outlook adn MS Word this is causing me issue as windows internal packages are not connecting to internet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
hope this helps you fix the problem</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for giving us a rundown, Bikram.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">We'd like to clarify some things about the information you provided thus far. To help us better isolate the possibilities as to why this issue remains, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><ul>
<li>Can you send us a screenshot of what your network icon looks like right now? It would also help to check the Network settings if there's an error message included aside from "Not connected". Otherwise, the screenshot will suffice.</li><li>Have you tried connecting your PC to the router with an Ethernet cable (LAN)? If not, we suggest that you do so and check the network icon status for any changes.</li><li>You mentioned that you set up your connection through "your mobile". Could you elaborate on that? Were there no instructions set for setting up connection through your computer?</li><li>To reiterate what Donna suggested previously, have you tried booting your device in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> to see if the issue is still prominent? You may refer to the link she provided for instructions.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have attached the screenshots for your reference. I have already tried the Safe Mode with Network that didn't work either. I have gone ahead and purchased a new PCI card. It should arrive next week, hopefully that will fix it.</p>

<p>Thanks for following us up Bikram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're also considering that this may have to do with how your router was set up. You did mention setting it up initially via mobile instead of your computer. As a hypothesis, it's possible that your computer is only able to connect to the internet and access
 browsers using your mobile as a hotspot, but not entirely able to utilize the full features of your internet connection. As such, you may need to contact your internet service provider for assistance in terms of setting it up properly in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the PCI card, that's another viewpoint to think about. In most cases, assembled PCs may encounter hardware incompatibility and are prone to certain functionality issues similar to this. In the event that the issue remains even with the new PCI card,
 it would be advisable to contact the device manufacturer to learn more about which hardware would work with your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance in the future.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have installed the new PCI Card it is (it's Asus AC68-1900) but the problem stays on. exactly same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way you could remote connect to my computer to my computer and try to fix the settings. I do not believe the computer is using the mobile as hotspot, this doesnt work that way, computer has to be connected to the mobile by a cable to use it
 as hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is now in weird teritorry for me as I have run out of ideas. Please help.</p>

<p>Based on the screenshot that you provided, there are multiple network listed. Do you know the name of your Wi-Fi network or the router that was provided to you by your Internet provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best to reach your Internet provider since your WiFi is working fine and for them to figure out if you are really connected to their network.</p>

<h2>            How do I take a MP3 file and record it to a tape recorder.</h2>
                    <p>I must be having a brain in-fart!! I cannot remember where the tape recording ends up! The line goes from my tape recorder to line in Jack. My next step is to go to a website to check my IQ! I am 72 and use the PC at least 5 hours a day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is to Filter the music file and then one again record it to a tape cassette. My aunt is 83 and does not want to do anything with the digital world!&nbsp; (**deleted personal information**)
</p>
<p>Lastly I had found about 20 songs recorded from my Church in Spring Valley N.Y. The are all MP3s!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can relieve me of my frustration! </p>

<p>Hi Joe - first, it's best not to put <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">too</span> much personal info up so I'd change your text in the Q (use the three dots to find the
<strong>edit</strong> control) and remove&nbsp;your aunt's&nbsp;age and street name... </p>
<p>About your recording - presumably you are using a program to copy the source tape... which one are you using? I do a lot of this stuff using the free 'Audacity' program so I understand what you want to do... watching for an update... Cheers, Ric.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Meant to mention</span> - a good source&nbsp;of
<strong>'How to</strong>...' tutorials for this sort of thing is '<strong>Youtube</strong>' - having it explained in a video says a lot more in a few minutes than loads of text!</p>

<p>
</p><p>It started happening after I did a quick scan on Avast and restarted the computer, I started to do a boot time scan and ended up stopping it after 3%. I did have 5 Trojans but I got rid of those.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cant verify myself under the PC Settings as it does nothing and I can't change my password to a pin or any other type of password. It gives me an error. Everything on my computer is up to date. I have Windows 8.1. Help ASAP would be nice. :)</p>

    <title>Chromebook faster than a PC...&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelitoguillermo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chromebook faster than a PC...&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm doing this thread to once &amp; for all find the ultimate answers to my PC issues. Before i bought my Lenovo Yoga 8 laptop i was thinking of buying a Google Chromebook. Specs might not be as high-end as a Windows PC but it loads a lot faster (having no such
 apps or enough background process to load in the background), apps load a lot faster, updates come automatically (and no need to download/intall like a PC), straighforward OS and no complicated hundreds of settings to tinker&nbsp; with unlike a PC.&nbsp; And besides
 a Chromebook is virus and malware-free forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also happen to come from a Macbook Air and i found my PC that slow. Downloading &amp; installing apps takes a lot longer, opening or closing an app or browser or tasks also takes longer. But in the course i have made some research to imprive the speed &amp; performanc
 of my Windows laptop mainly:</p>
<p>1. Turned off bluetooth</p>
<p>2. Set Windows Update to automatic</p>
<p>3. Updated Windows Defender </p>
<p>4. Defrafgging my gard drive monthly</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Choose Selective Startup (under msconfig) and made sure no apps are enabled under Startup, selected apps are running under Services, choose a higher number under Processors and maximum memory set to at least half of what my Lenovo is capable of (under
 Boot)</p>
<p>6. Set performance to High Performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else have i missed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i noticed when i look at Task Manager there are background processes that i do not understand and i'm not sure whether to disable them or not although it shows 0% affecting the RAM, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i don't get satisfied with this "comlicated" WIndows 8.1 OS i might as well sell it and get a Chromebook as i use most of their services anyway on my Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please advice. Thanks.</p>
<p>

</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb62f1d0-2f8b-438f-87c5-786d6d882bdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb62f1d0-2f8b-438f-87c5-786d6d882bdb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, in Photo Viewer, the image is obviously discolored, the Windows Explorer space yellow.&nbsp; The same thing happens when I open it in Windows Live Photo Gallery.&nbsp; The only MS program I don't have this problem with is Microsoft Paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my images coming up yellow, and how do I fix this problem?</p>

            <p>Hello, <br />
<br />
This issue may occur because an incorrect color profile is used for the monitor device in the Color Management setting. Might have been due to a updated driver that is conflicting with Windows Color Management System.
<br />
<br />
Here's how to correct it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Type in <strong>color</strong> into the search bar and click on the <em>green <strong>
Color Management</strong> link</em>.<br />
3. A dialog box will pop-up, under the <strong>Device</strong> tab, tick the box located under your monitor name that says "<strong>Use my settings for this device</strong>".
<br />
4. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button<br />
5. A list of color profiles will appear. Select <strong>sRGBIEC611966-2.1</strong> then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
6. Lastly, click on the "<strong>Set as Default Profile</strong>" button and then click the
<strong>Close</strong> button.<br />
<br />
Update us with the outcome.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<h2>            Convert a Windows 8pro product key to a Windows 10pro produkt key</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>I bought a new notebook some months ago. On that new notebook was Windows 8.1home installed. Soon after the release of Windows 10 i updated the installed Windows 8.1home to Windows 10home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before i bought the new computer i owned an older one. That one was installed with Windows 8.1pro. That Windows 8.1pro is a full licensed Windows 8.1pro with a CD box. Now i do not longer need the old PC with the Windows8.1pro installed. I want to use the
 Windows8.1pro product key to bring the Windows 10 home on my new PC to Windows 10pro
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without (!)</span> a new installation on my new PC. Just get a Windows 10pro key for my Windows 8.1pro key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Andre</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10&nbsp;is a free upgrade on the old Windows operating system, you would not get any prompt to enter Windows 10 product key however if you want to clean install Windows 10 on a new machine you can buy a license key for Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller right analog stick sensitivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> truthprojects  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller right analog stick sensitivity</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I have read through the forums and found no post relevant to a change in sensitivity. &nbsp;So basically what is happening is when you turn your character to the left (using the right stick) there is no problems. &nbsp;But sometimes when turning to the right
 (still using the right stick) the speed of the turn goes EXTREMELY slow as compared to turning to the left. &nbsp;I would say turning left is 100 percent speed, and turning right slows down to maybe 25 percent. &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating especially since I
 am very careful with my things. &nbsp;Never thrown or dropped it before and only maybe 6-8 months use on the controller. &nbsp;I've fixed the issue once within the last week (shortly after it happened, by turning it off and putting in fresh rechargeable batteries) but
 it later started happening again after changing batteries. &nbsp;This problem makes FPS games like Destiny, Cod AW or any other game that requires the right stick unplayable. &nbsp;I do not believe the controller is broke because the problem doesn't happen consistently.
 &nbsp;I have thought it may be the batteries but this problem persists even with new rechargeable ones. &nbsp;Another thing worth mentioning is that the slower turning only happens for half a second or so then it speeds up to normal speed. &nbsp;Doesn't sound game breaking
 but believe me, IT IS. &nbsp; I've only noticed this issue on Destiny, which again is only a recent issue. &nbsp;I used an original white xbox 360 controller for the entire lifespan of my xbox 360 which was years. &nbsp;I will be very shocked and disappointed if buying a
 new 60 dollar controller is the only fix for this problem. &nbsp;60 dollars for 6 months of play time on hardware is just ridiculous. &nbsp;I would really appreciate any help or suggestions anyone might have. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue with slow turning. I first noticed it on Destiny but it also happens while playing Halo. It definitely handicaps you while playing PvP.

<h2>            No Network Adapter</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, when I start my computer my internet won't work, so I run the diagnosis and it says I dont have a properly installed Network Adapter. So I go to Device Manager and it's not there. So I end up having to roll my computer back 2-3 days to get the driver
 back and it seems to work but it gets annoying.</p>
<p>I have windows 7 Home premium</p>
<p>Driver: Atheros AR8121/AR8113/AR8114 PCE-E Ethernet Controller. Version 1.0.0.22</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are Drivers for that Adapter at ASUStek under the Windows 7 32 or 64 bit - LAN<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&amp;model=P5KPL-CM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&amp;model=P5KPL-CM</a><br />
<br />
Have you disabled the on-board network adapter? If so why are you using an older one?<br />
<br />
If not then get the latest driver from ASUStek.<br />
<br />
Check with ASUS support and their forums.<br />

            <p>Some&nbsp;thoughts:</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Create a second admin account [for testing use - see paras below] &amp; a third as a spare.&nbsp; Any account's profile can get corrupted and if that is a sole admin account then you suddenly have serious problems.&nbsp; I would recommend this anyway but it seems particularly
 important now because all you know for sure is (a) that there is something wrong somewhere in your PC but you don't know what or where and (b) that you are now going to start experimenting with the system.&nbsp; Create the new accounts, create
<em>Password reset disks</em> for them &amp; do a test login to both of them.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Can you find some other installation file just to prove that the PC is capable of installing something?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Use&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;new admin accounts to retry the test installation at para 2 and then the proper&nbsp;
<span><span><em>Windows 7 USB DVD download</em> <em>tool</em> installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These tests can, between them, help you&nbsp;narrow down the problem to&nbsp;installation issues, user profile issues. or something specific to the DVD-USB tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em>If I knew anything about the Event log then I might be able to suggest where to look for more detailed diagnostic evidence.</em>&nbsp; But I don't and therefore&nbsp;can't.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have only used the DVD-USB tool once.&nbsp; It worked so I have not had to use it again.&nbsp; I suspect that everyone else who has used it has the same once-only experience of installing it.&nbsp; This problem therefore really does put you into uncharted
 territory.&nbsp; I've had a look around SevenForums and had a general Google search but have not been able to find anything useful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Best of luck with this,</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Candice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does sound frustrating. <span>There are several reasons that might make a PC go into recovery mode. Perhaps
</span><span>your PC encountered a hardware malfunction, an unexpected configuration change, or another security event. Requiring a recovery key helps ensure that only an authorized person can unlock your PC and restore access to your encrypted data.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Assuming
 that your device isn't connected to a domain, you may recover your Bitlocker Recovery Key<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/RecoveryKey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately, if you can’t find your key, and no other administrator on the PC can find a backup copy either, you’ll need to restore the PC to factory default settings. You may contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Poor outgoing video quality in Skype Android</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
After struggling too long to get a skype support contact, i am using this platform to raise my concern.<br />
I am using lenovo vibe K6 power<br />
Android version 6.0.1&nbsp;<br />
During video call the video that i am receiving is of pretty good quality and have nice streaming speed. However my video is really very poor and I feel horrible when i see myself in that video stream (i am not that horrible though). It must be getting degraded
 further when it will be reaching the other end. I am not having this issue with other apps like hangout, messenger, Google duo etc. I tried using the high quality video option provided in the settings however it is of no help. I have been using skype for a
 very long time now and don't want to migrate over some other app. Please provide me a solution so that i am able to have a nice video chat. And stop scaring people and myself by my video.

<p>No, The input stream from the front camera is of poor quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is some issue with the camera and Skype compatibility. I don't know where i can troubleshoot it. but all other video calling apps are working fine with the same internet connection.</p>

<p>The issue with Skype for Android video quality persists. I also get maximum 640x360 resolution with the Android app. Although I have a Full-HD Logitech camera connected to my Android mini PC. Very disappointing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft: When will you enable Full-HD quality for the Skype Android app again?</p>
<p>First you discontinue the highly valuable app for Smart TVs, now you degrade the quality of the Android app step by step, now being at 640x360.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, it didn't help !!! Please stop giving "generalized" support advice, but ADDRESS the problem - my camera is 1280 x 720p and the max. resolution I get outgoing (even on a broadband connection) is max. 640 x 360 which is only 25% !!!??? (of maximum) ...
 This is truely VERY disappointing!&nbsp; Stop these "auto-sizing" nonsense and make the resolution settings available explicit as it used to be!!!</p>

<p>the only way you gonna get any better then 360P is by running ver 7.x an both the Android and a PC, and on the PC you need to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting Silk_v3 back </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Reinstalling the latest version of Skype. (you don't really need to)<br />
2.&nbsp; Browsing to the Skype folder which is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone<br />
3.&nbsp; renaming RtmCodec.dlls&nbsp; (i.e. RtmCodecs.old)<br />
4.&nbsp; Relaunch Skype and place a video call.&nbsp; If you performed the rename while Skype was running, you would have to complete quit Skype and restart it for the changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>            compressing photos.</h2>
                    <p>I can't compress a single photo in the thirteen thousand I have. As a journalist I HAVE to be able to compress. Windows 10 is for crap for this, there is no feature which we had in Windows 7 and for the life of me I cannot find a single app that does this
 SIMPLY, KEY WORD SIMPLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the fact that I despise anything and everything that came after Windows 7 I am stuck with this when I bought a new computer. And I can't compress a single thing. That makes this photo program utterly and totally and undeniably USELESS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix? I have been searching for weeks and months and haven't found one. SIMPLE AND EASY THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys don't even have a category (below ) for this. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>First of all, your reply wasn't showing when I started drafting mine - so I wasn't contradicting you.</p>
<p><span>My friend wants to compress his photos to save space - personally I'd find a way to increase storage space but that's his choice.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'd have thought that 'compress/compression' are terms commonly used and understood by most users to mean "to save space". ('Zipping' is another.) We can compress a file, a folder or even a drive - or so
 I'm told. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>I will ask you the same question I asked the OP:&nbsp; What do you mean by "compress"?<br />
</p>

<p>Compress: same photo, sized for web&nbsp; use, or for sending in emails. Photos i take are WAY too big to send or to use. When I download photos from Deposit PHotos for some of my articles they are massive and no matter what I've tried (edit, crop, makes no effing
 difference) the photos are useless. Still too big or horribly distorted or as I tried with this Irfn r whatever it is, I repeatedly made the photo smaller, saved the new version, and when I put it on my article it was precisely the same size. Uttelry totally
 useless waste of time. all of it. When I opened up a few of these links they all way that Windows Photo manager no longer exists and it most certainly isn't available on Windows 10.

This is my entire point. I have been going in circles for about a week. I can't figure out this Irfan thing- the photo I want to work with is loaded on it and it is completeLy and utterly indecipherable.&nbsp; When you go to the Help menu it's also completely and
 utterly indecipherable. There is a series of what look like Chinese characters (and the average person is supposed to know what the hell this means? Please?) and the FAQs read like Latin to anyone wanting to ask the simplest most basic question:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0">
This is beyond ludicrous. I need a SIMPLE TOOL. Something that offers simple basic, instructions, IN ENGLISH Please, a help menu that is readable, a search bar to ask a question (which Ifram does not have), a tool that simply allows me to do ONE GODAMNED SIMPLE
 THING. There is no file that offers instructions to someone who doesn't understand complex terminology. I want one achingly simple solution to a problem a great many of us have:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Make photos small enough for web work, emails, and other applications. When I search applications I cant find this. What are offered are high end, complex products that work for pros. I don't need that. I can't speak that language. It's way over my pay grade.

<p style="margin-left: 0">
I appreciate the responses on here and I am following the links. The links DO NOT WORK. I keep being sent back to the same fundamental response: what you want IS NOT LONGER AVAILABLE.&nbsp; We cannot get access to Windows Photo Gallery or any of the programs these
 links discuss because some dimwit at MIcrosoft decided to take away a hugely useful, popular program.

<p>I will ask you the same question I asked the OP:&nbsp; What do you mean by "compress"?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, your reply wasn't showing when I started drafting mine - so I wasn't contradicting you.</p>
<p><span>My friend wants to compress his photos to save space - personally I'd find a way to increase storage space but that's his choice.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'd have thought that 'compress/compression' are terms commonly used and understood by most users to mean "to save space". ('Zipping' is another.) We can compress a file, a folder or even a drive - or so
 I'm told. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Around here, assuming that people who ask questions are using terminology correctly can result in confusion, so it's always best to ask for clarification.&nbsp; If the image files are .jpg, they're already compressed, so attempting to compress them further doesn't
 accomplish much.&nbsp; On the other hand, <em>resizing </em>a JPEG image can result in reduced file size.&nbsp; For example, I have a 16MP image (4608 x 3456) that's about 7.5MB.&nbsp; Reducing the size (the pixel count) to 1366 x 768 reduces the file size to 380KB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reducing
 the pixel count affects the quality of the image, but unless you're trying to print the picture in a large format it won't make much difference.&nbsp;

<h2>            Did the 360 have issues early on&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I didn't start playing on xbox live until Call of Duty 4. &nbsp;My experience with the 360 was near flawless over the course of several years. &nbsp;Games always loaded. &nbsp;Parties were simple and reliable. &nbsp; &nbsp;My controller and headset didn't
 randomly stop working mid game. &nbsp;I have had more issues with my xbox one in one year than I had with my 360 in seven years. &nbsp;Everyone I've talked to on my friends list has had the same issues and is wondering the same thing.</p>
<p>Will theses issues be ironed out with more time? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the 360 have similar issues early on in it's life cycle?</p>
<p>Why was the 360 more simple and reliable than the newer, more powerful gaming system?</p>
<p>This isn't an xbox one hate thread. &nbsp;I'm an xbox fan. &nbsp;I plan on playing xbox one for several years. &nbsp;I'm just wondering what I should expect going forward.</p>

<p>The 360 was perfect at the time of it's launch. Way better than the Xbox One. I can't remember experiencing any problems on the 360 when it first came out. the Xbox One is a different story. I think Microsoft rushed it out to the market too fast. Don't get
 me wrong. I love the Xbox One but I would have rather had a flawless Xbox One console launch like the 360 had. They are coming along with the updates though but these updates should have been with the console at launch but to me it feels like it was rushed
 just to beat the PS4.</p>

<p>Seriously Max... ??? &nbsp;Short memory I guess..the 360 was FAR from perfect.. what and how you know the 360 a year ago and even today was NOTHING like how it was 9 years ago...the current 460 dash is only about 4 years old...</p>
<p>&nbsp;it suffered from a large failure rate where a large % had to be returned.</p>
<p>the thing scratched just about every disc you out into it...</p>
<p>The machine was not slow, but was absolutely bare</p>
<p>This is the original dashoard</p>

<p>There is really no way to compare.</p>
<p>The 360 was far more simplistic at the timeof its release.</p>
<p>No party chat no apps. Little to nothing in the market place with little to no people buying from it anyway.</p>
<p>Much smaller and more simple games.</p>
<p>As compared to the immense amount of stuff the One does at launch.</p>
<p>Please note I am not defending this bugy broken machine but imo due to the different amount of task that process in each machine from then and now is impossible to compare.</p>
<p>I would also have liked to see a more flawless release but there is just too much going on in this console so knowing what I know now I would expect it to have as much issueas it does.</p>

<p>I guess I lucked out and missed the first two years of the 360. &nbsp;My white 360 lasted 5 years (over 100 days played online). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed the original dashboard and the newer dashboard on the 360. &nbsp;I can navigate the xbox one dashboard but it isn't as simple as the 360. &nbsp;I find myself digging around looking for things...especially in the settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue isn't really the dashboard though, it's mainly the party system issues. &nbsp;The party system is the most important feature to me for consoles.

<p>The 360's were plagued with bucket loads of problems and M would not even acknowledge them. It took the EU Courts to FORCE them to fix these problems, as in the US and other countries M was simply "too big to fail/jail."
</p>
<p>Many gamers including Kawboy... Simply gave up trying to have M fix his consoles RROD that he decided to sell it "as is" on Ebay for pennies on the dollar. And the console wasn't even a year old. - Here is where M goofed up. You keep sending in a console
 with RROD and keep getting back the same RROD that M swears they fixed and the more you listen to their excuses the closer you're getting to the end of the warranty period.
</p>
<p>For my part, it took me 5 or more years after the release of the 360 to buy one, and I would not have bought it at all if I hadn't followed the EU lawsuit.

<p>I never got the RRoD on any of the 3 360 consoles I owned. I also have any problems with discs being scratched. I guess I was one of the lucky ones. I didn't forget about the RRoD though. My first 2 console's I traded in. One for the PS3 at the time and
 the other one I traded in for the Xbox One. I bought a used 3rd console and it runs like a champ. I've never had any problems with any of the consoles I owned and right now I have a 360, Xbox One, and a PS4.</p>

    <title>Skype Account Locked - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Account Locked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the same skype account for well over 6 years now and have had no issues. I was using it last night to talk to clients and friends and signed out before going to sleep. I wake up and try to login and am greeted with the message "Your account has
 been locked for your security" and am given the option to fill in the original email that I used to create the account. Having been such a long length of time since I made the account and the fact I always use my username to login I have no clue what the original
 email is. I have used the Text Support to talk to CS who have been absolutely useless as far as giving me any answer's to why my account was locked or providing a solution to getting it unlocked. I filled in the form that I was directed to when I couldn't
 give the original email and one of the questions on this asks for the original email. Now how am I meant to answer this when the reason for me filling in the form is because I don't know the email! I setup a secondary email on the account that I have access
 to as well as a list of over 50 contacts that were on the account but apparently the only way to regain access is to know the original email which in my eyes is insane. Any help on this would be great as I run a business through that account and currently
 the best answer the support gave me was "Maybe its time to move on and make a new account".</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few reasons why a Skype account is getting restricted. We will restrict your account from using Skype's paid features if:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>We notice unusual activity, for example markedly different usage of your Skype Credit or subscription, that suggests someone other than you might have taken control of it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You are disputing a payment (also called a chargeback), since this indicates that there is a problem with either your payment method or your account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>There is a violation of Skype’s <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Terms of Use</a>. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Indeed, the protection of your data is one of our fundamental responsibilities. Answering our Account Verification Form will help us identify the cause as to why your account is
 suspended and lift the restriction accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have created this policy in order to help you protecting your personal information. That being said, I strongly recommend you to fill out the form once again. You may go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/partial.block.recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account

<p>Besser das es nicht geht. Stell dir vor man löscht aus versehen was anderes oder der Kumpel der nicht verlieren kann macht es schnell - wäre alles nicht so gut.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose on recent update my computer crashed "Stop Code: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED" blue screen. Finally got it to open and sadly had to do an entire system restore; losing all my files! Get it back up and today a new error: "UNMOUNTABLE
 BOOT VOLUME" and back to the beginning an entire system restore. What next! How do I fix this for good? Not that I did the system restore I cant go back to&nbsp;previous state (before update) What do I do before it crashes again?

            Hello! 
<br />
<br />Can you please post your .dmp files here? Then we can further analyze the issue. 
<br />
<br />Also, how often does this happen? Have you tried a system restore? 
<br />
<br />
<br />Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump
<br />
<br />Use OneDrive to upload collected files

<p>Evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for dmp extension files. I have looked for memory or minidump directories and found nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you another recommendation of where to find files of that sort to help describe this issue?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Probably your drive has an issue as far as the code say.

            Hi there!<br /><br />Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon. If is this your case, I suggest you try installing Classic Skype <a href="https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223c4e4e9e3e4ce/SkypeSetupFull.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223...</a>
