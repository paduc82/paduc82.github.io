    <title>Clear Browser History in Windows-10 Edge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clear Browser History in Windows-10 Edge</h2>
                    <p>It appears that the new Windows-10 Edge Browser is incapable of setting-up an automatic clearing of your browsing history when closing Edge Browser.</p>
<p>I am getting the feeling that the new Windows-10 program has been developed with one purpose in mind, to collect as much information about your personal&nbsp;preferences of how you use and what you purchase, write and say over the internet and&nbsp;on your computer.
 I say this because of all the "turn off" options (most of which, allow the programs to send information to other locations)&nbsp;that are available at the beginning of the installation process. And of-course by making it an added step to clear all browser history
 which many people will forget to do when closing the browser.</p>
<p>I personally hope what I am saying is not true.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have gone through all the processes I can find for Edge, including checking the box in the tools "clear history on exit" with no success. I have tried contacting support through the "chat" system, and after 71 minutes with no response, requested a call
 which was to be made to me in 103 minutes. 2 1/2 hours later my phone rings, I get a recorded message asking me "if I had requested support to press 1", after pressing one to confirm my request, I was on hold for 7 more minutes, and then got a recording that
 there is a "system error" and "thank you for calling Microsoft". </p>
<p>This not only happened once, but 3 times, and at this point I have no way to contact them. The phone number listed on their website does not ring through, and they have managed to stay away from dealing with the issues at hand by hiding behind a series of
 filters that are designed to frustrate the average user to the point of accepting less than what Windows 10 is promoted to be.

<p>Can I add my vote to getting this fixed asap. Edge rather blunted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me almost everything in Edge seems an improvement over Explorer, BUT the failure to include the "Delete History on Exit" leaves Edge with the same glaring security loophole as Chrome. Having Delete on Exit was a U.S.P. for Explorer. At least Explorer
 is still in Win10 and I for one will retain a short-cut to it for all occasions when I've no interest in making my searches available on Microsoft's (or Google's) servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please include the facility, with the same exception options for Favourites, at the next uplift to Edge to give it back its 'edge'</p>
<p>yours</p>

            <p>The roll out of Windows 10 was premature by MS in my opinion. They didn't&nbsp;have a plan for&nbsp;increased support staff, the phone numbers are over loaded, the&nbsp;contact by mail gets no response, and the glitches, which may be ironed out some day, require&nbsp;the consumer
 to be the test market for the product. </p>
<p>I don't have the time to go back and forth removing sensitive web searches, rebooting for freeze ups and constantly trying to get out of pop ups that demand a response.
</p>
<p>As of this writing I have returned to Windows 8.1, stabilized my operation system, and uninstalled Windows 10. I realize that eventually MS will do as they did with XP and not support this older version, but until that time I will keep using it.
</p>
<p>WORD OF CAUTION: YOU ONLY HAVE 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF INSTALLATION OF WINDOWS 10 TO USE THE AUTOMATIC RESTORATION THAT IS IMBEDDED WITH THE PROGRAM. AFTER THAT DATE YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IT ALL MANUALLY, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT GIVE YOU FULL DATA RESTORATION DEPENDING
 ON YOUR DILIGENCE TO ESTABLISHING RESTORE POINTS WHEN YOU HAD MS 8.1</p>

            <p>Your word of caution is exactly why I decide to put Windows 10 on a vhd. I have the option to play with W10 as long as I want and if I don't like&nbsp;W10 I can delete the vhd and continue with W7. So far W10 has been a fair OS in my opinion. Nothing about it
 impresses me at all. It also seems to be slower than W7. The setup is pretty easy as for getting around well it leaves a lot to be desired. As for the aesthetics it is really the design of 1st and 2nd graders. The updates take too long to download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to disable everything in W10 and one by one I enabled what I believe is useful to me. This took a few days because I had to research some of the features. When you go into Settings&gt;Privacy&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the explanations&nbsp;are too vague. Almost all of the
 apps need to access "and other account info." There is no need for my printer to access my camera. Anyway all these things can be controlled but opens up the mind to all sorts of questions WHY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I like W10, it will take some time to really appreciate its capabilities. I hope when the&nbsp;major update come it changes this grade school look.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with your opinions about the gross invasions of privacy built into Win-10.<br />
Remember - We <strong>do not <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">own</span></strong> even the Windows version that is installed on our computers. All we OWN is a license to US it.</p>
<p>I foresee the time when MS offers their OSs as a subscription [per month/year] much like they do with their Office 365 and like Adobe does with their Creative Cloud apps/suites.

            When they start charging an annual fee I'll migrate to Linnux and use Open Office. I use it already via a dual boot, but will be more than happy to get rid of MS completely.

            Whilst I agree with this post, and I am all ready an Open Office user as I have never needed all the bells and whistles contained in Microsoft Office, I actually do like Microsoft as a firm and am very happy to use their operating systems. Having used
 xp (good), Vista (okay) 7 (good) and now 10 (so far so good) I've never had a complaint. I actually like to think that my usage of Microsoft products helps Bill Gates to fulfill his charity work.

            <p>I would like to add one more comment to my previous one. The upgrades of MS operating systems over the years creates a totally different set of problems beyond that of whether or not the consumer like it. As Windows phases out older operating systems, it
 creates an expensive fix for the commercial user as well. I owned a graphics and printing business for many years. During that time, I had to upgrade systems to keep up with what was being sold as an operating system with new computers. The cost to additionally
 have a $200,000 piece of equipment&nbsp;driver upgrade was $1000's&nbsp;of dollars over the years.
</p>
<p>It would be a simple process if MS would create a partition automatically during the installation, that would default back to use of existing drivers for devices. Of course when I can get in touch with MS, they blame it on the manufacture of the device,
 while the manufacture is saying in many cases the information needed to create the drivers is slow to come from MS. (Was just told by Xerox that the driver for one of my pieces may be available next year)
</p>
<p>Either way, I would "guess-ta-mate" I have easily accumulated over $25k in extra costs to try to keep up. For a small business owner, that can kill you in time.</p>

            To me, Edge is MUCH more stable that IE.&nbsp; I couldn't go through my facebook pages without the videos going green-screen on IE, but have not had one playback error.&nbsp; So far, this has been a vast improvement over 8.1..&nbsp; I'm sure that things will come together
 as people leave feedback.

            <p>Perhaps you might consider the next best thing to the automatic clearing of your browsing history.&nbsp; I am mostly concerned with left over cookies.&nbsp; So, I, long ago, set up a short cut on my desktop which leads&nbsp;to the explorer folder where all the cookies
 seem to live.</p>
<p>In my case, the short cut is;</p>
<p>C:\Users\Paul\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache</p>
<p>
</p><p>Substitute&nbsp;your log in name where my name is in the above line. The create a desktop short cut with this new line as your reference location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I have logged out of the explorer, I open the folder by selecting the short cut.&nbsp; Select all the files and then delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it!&nbsp; You might like it!</p>

<h2>            Auto volume adjust based on mic input</h2>
                    Is there some kind of enhancement that will detect sound volume from my mic and adjust my volume accordingly so that I will always hear the same volume even if room noise increases?<br />
<br />
This will sound strange but I live right next to a railroad with trains passing by at least once every 15min. When I am watching movies I want the system to auto adjust the volume. Is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />
I have a Toshiba Laptop with a built in microphone.<br />

</p><p>The problem is if you are docked or plugged the Ethernet cable with a minidisplay adapter and disconnect the cable or undock, the user loses internet activity for several seconds so Skype disconnects of course. I did bind the order of network and made sure
 WIFI was first and that seemed to work on my surface pro 3 a little but when trying to do the same for a Surface user, still the switch disconnects and connects to the WIFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some setting to disable for switching so WIFI is connected while cabled in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea? I don't see much besides metric order or binding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Administrator Password accepted but nothing happens</h2>
                    I am logged in as a standard user, I enter control panel and the users account page.&nbsp; I click on "manage User accounts", I get a pop-up that says "Type an administrator password and then click yes".&nbsp; I enter my ADM PW and click click yes, the pop-up goes
 away but nothing happens.&nbsp; Anything I try that needs an ADM PW does the same thing.&nbsp; I need to open a new user account so I can&nbsp; fix my user profile and log into my main administrator user account.&nbsp; What to try next?&nbsp;

It is a scam, and is attempting to get access to your account (probably asked for your hotmail, live mail, or similar login and password to 'verify' the account, right...?)
<div>Hopefully you ignored it... if not, then change your account password(s) ASAP. &nbsp;And use strong passwords, and unique passwords (never use the same password on more than one sensitive account such as email, and anything financial!)<br />

<h2>            Intermittent WiFi issues after the Windows 10 May 2019 update</h2>
                    <div>Hello</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been running into wifi connectivity issues on my Windows 10 laptop, since around mid-May 2019. I believe some updates were installed then (automatically).</div>
<div>Every few seconds, the laptop loses connectivity to the internet.<br />
</div>
<div>Other devices on the same wifi network, work fine.<br />
</div>
<div>Following some threads on the internet about outdated drivers, i tried to update my WLAN driver (RealTek 8821AE WLAN Driver).<br />
</div>
<div>I have tried resetting my network. But none of this seems to fix the issue.<br />
</div>
<div>I tried uninstalling the updates, but they seem to get installed again and one Security update cannot be uninstalled.<br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Vikas<br />

            Hi Vik.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>Tried almost everything and still no luck.</p>
<p>Ipv6 was already enabled.</p>
<p>Uninstalled and reinstalled Realtek WLan n/w adapter drivers</p>
<p>Reset the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the Ethernet cable is something i could not try yet.</p>
<p>i had uninstalled May updates , but some security updates got downloaded and installed again.</p>
<p>Some updates i cannot uninstall (such as Security Update for Windows KB4497398).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the recovery options, if i do restore my machine back to a previous point, will i lose any data created after that point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, this issue started occurring mid-May; i haven't installed anything that time; so i believe it should be due to some updates that got installed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <a href="https://betanews.com/2019/05/28/windows-10-may-2019-update-wi-fi-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> does mention about this issue. But it is for Qualcomm and May update v.1903.</p>
<p>i dont have Qualcomm or 1903. let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            System Restore does not remove files, just any changes to Windows and apps.
<br />
<br />One other thing you could try is to manually upgrade to Version 1903 by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />If any problems follow these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>hi Greg</p>
<p>I upgraded to 1903 (See attached).</p>
<p>Still the problem occurs.</p>
<p>Although the disconnection is for a shorter duration than before.</p>
<p>Earlier the disconnection used to happen for 5-10 seconds. Now it is for 3-5 seconds.</p>

            Do you have the latest Wlan driver from the PC maker's Support downloads web page for your exact model?
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the Wlan driver in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />Try previous drivers from Device Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick.
<br />
<br />If not then trace the Hardware ID to do a search for a better driver for the Wlan:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>I noticed in the Windows Update Settings section, there was a pending restart after the 1903 installation. After i restarted, i did not face issues for about 30 min. Thereafter, the same problem started recurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i uninstalled my WLAN drivers and downloaded an older version of the driver from Lenovo's website. After installing the older version, weirdly, it shows me the same version that i had uninstalled; not the one i downloaded.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, i tried and the issue seems to be fixed for the most part. I did notice some latency on 2-3 occasions but they were short (~3 seconds each).</p>
<p>I have been testing on Citrix to connect to my work computer.<br />
Is there an easier way to test this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Vikas</p>

            Hi again Vikas -
<br />
<br />Not that I know of.
<br />
<br />If you want to test by removing the drivers then delete them from their location in the Device Manager Driver tab &gt; Details button.  
<br />
<br />Older versions are also available in Dev Mgr Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let me Pick.

            I just discovered the Bluetooth Drivers were causing ALL of our Wi-Fi issues in Windows 10 version 1903 (May 2019 update). I updated Bluetooth Drivers and ALL the Wi-Fi issues went away immediately. Thought I would share. :-)

            <p>Assuming you are on the latest version of Movie Maker (<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">15.4.3555.0308</a>), the Animations tab should have buttons to apply a certain transition to all clips.&nbsp; But there isn't a "randomize" feature.</p>
<p>There is an "Automated Pan &amp; Zoom" animation that will put a variety of P&amp;Z effects on your clips.&nbsp; There is also the AutoMovie feature on the Home tab that puts in a variety of transitons and effects, but otherwise you have to pick your own transitions
 and effects.</p>

<h2>            Problem installing an owned app from Windows Store</h2>
                    I am running Windows 8.1 on my PC and am trying to install an app from Windows Store - I keep getting the banner message<strong> "Something happened and your purchase can't be completed. Error Code: 0xc03f300d"</strong> I have valid payment options linked
 to my Microsoft Account, but when I access 'my account' directly from the Store it displays "<strong>before you purchase an app you must add a payment method to your account"</strong>. When I click on the
<strong>"Add</strong> <strong>Payment Method"</strong> button below nothing happens.

<p>Agree this only became a problem after an update to Windows.&nbsp; If your Surface Tablet is running 8 or 8.1, see my reply below.&nbsp; I am convinced Microsoft is trying to force upgrading to Windows 10 as almost all the help topics associated with this issue only
 address using 10.&nbsp; I tried using Windows 10 when it first came out but quickly switched back to 8.1.&nbsp; I have had no problems with my apps or accessing the store before this week.&nbsp; With so many experiencing the same difficulty, it must have been caused by a
 Microsoft update change.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the reply, but I have exhausted all the suggestions that have been provided for me, and that includes TomTom support.</p>
<p>As far as drivers are concerned, every effort to download drivers failed, because I was reluctant to purchase the driver check program.</p>
<p>As near as I can determine, Windows 7 does not recognize my USB connecton for my&nbsp;two TomToms which are XL (series 30) and One XL.</p>
<p>I have 3 computers, but all are loaded with Windows7.&nbsp; TomTom support said that Windows 7 worked with the later models, but did not tell me if it works with the older models.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>C. Greene</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

    <title>MS Paint acking up&#58; not enough memory or resources to complete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drenchediguana  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Paint acking up&#58; not enough memory or resources to complete operation</h2>
                    I drew this awesome Iguana in paint and wanted to color it. I decided to go for a black and white look and entered settings and chose black and white, giving me the greyscales instead of colors.<br />
I zoomed in to 300% zoom, selected white as color 1 and the third from the right in the second row as color 2. Then I selected the eraser tool and started coloring the white background on the Iguana by using the right mouse button.<br />
I tried this several times and each time after about 30-60 seconds ms paint would show me this message:
<br />
<blockquote>There is not enough memory or resources to complete operation.<br />
Close some programs, and then try again.</blockquote>
When this happened I checked the task manager as I couldn't comprehend something like that being the case. Apparently I was only using about 60% of my 2GB of memory, mspaint.exe using somewhere between 9.000-14.000 K according to the task manager.<br />
<br />
I tried opening a new mspaint and doing the same as descriped above again: 300% zoom, black and white, eraser, white as color 1, that other one as color 2, right click painting using eraser: after some time, same result.
<br />
<br />
What is going on?<br />
<br />
I'm using an Eeebox EB1012 with 2GB RAM, dual core Intel Atom 330, Win7 (naturally)<br />
<br />
EDIT: If this is not clear enough: ms paint wouldn't respond after the above mentioned message was shown and I had to End Process using the task manager.<br />

<div>Hi DrenchedIguana,</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
Let us try the following&nbsp;workaround and check if it helps us in resolving this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Important </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: <br />
How to back up and restore the registry in Windows: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a><br />
<br />
<div>Let us make sure all the instances of MS Paint are closed before performing the steps below:</div>
<div>1. Click Start, click Run, type regedit and click OK to start registry editor.</div>
<div>2. Navigate to this key<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Paint<br />
and delete the Paint Key.</div>
<div>3. Exit registry editor and Restart the computer.</div>
<div>4. Start Paint to see whether your problem has been solved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>If the issue still exists I would recommend you to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a New User Account </a>and check if the issue exists. If the issue is resolved in the new user account I would advise you to fix the corrupt user profile.</div>
