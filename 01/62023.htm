<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Fail</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to upgrade to the new anniversary edition, but get a message that says my LinkSys AE 1200/2500 802.11 wireless lan dongle is not compatible with this version of Windows. I have been using this wireless dongle with Windows 10 with no problem.
 My wife just upgraded to the anniversary edition using the exact same dongle, with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the upgrade failed, my computer is now running very slow and many programs no longer respond. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I'm looking at this error message right now via the Media Creation Tool and I'm wondering if I should proceed.&nbsp; It's been working with Windows 10 up to this point without issues.&nbsp; I had to manually install the AE1200 software after installing Windows 10
 initially but it worked once it was done.&nbsp; I now keep a local copy of the software incase I run into any problems and lose internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that this error message pops up because it is not a true modem or wifi card and therefore the OS may not recognize it after install?&nbsp; If this is the case, I'm also assuming that the AE1200 software should install and work as before once the
 Windows 10 update is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say its working for your wife, correct?&nbsp; So, the device should still work after the update - after reinstalling the AE1200 software.</p>

            <p>I just had the same issue over this weekend while trying to upgrade from windows 7 to windows 10...Even microsoft support was not able to find the root cause...Finally after a lot of trial and error i found that there is a driver AE2500 in the following
 location</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted this AE2500 file(driver), restarted the windows and tried to upgrade Windows again and now it went through without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this fixed your issue, so that it will help others who have a similar issue.<br />

            <p>Hello&nbsp;Gage Goge,</p><p><br /></p><p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:
  </p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the MyMissions page at <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a> .
  </p>
<p>-or-
  </p>
<p>2. For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star MyVIP level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as MyVIP payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders, in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP.
  </p>
<p>In September 2014 we changed to the MyVIP policy. As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued. Also, as mentioned in our pinned announcement at the top of the forums titled "<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HEY YOU! We've got your answer here.</a>" (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55</a>), we no longer award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals as of July 2014.
  </p>
<p>MyVIP had a recalibration for the last few years. At the end of the year, we place you in your MyVIP rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016. We did not recalibrate this year (December 2017). Since you are a zero star member, you do not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You can see a complete history of your Credit and deposit events from the MyStatement on the MyRewards page. You can then use the dates listed for your deposits to see their deposit as currency from your commerce page at (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/</a>), where they will be listed as a refund with a negative amount.

<p>Sorry to hear about the game crashing issue!</p>
<p>Twigleaf Twigs, I see that you have unlocked all of the achievements for Unmechanical: Extended, are you still experiencing this issue? If so please post back and let us know!</p>
<p>Icarusael, if you're still experiencing this issue, I would start by power cycling your console to see if the Extended episode loads afterwards. To power cycle, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press and hold the power button on the Xbox One console for 10 seconds, or until the unit is fully powered off.</span></li>
<li><span>Unplug the power supply from the back of the Xbox One console and let it sit for 5 minutes.</span></li>
<li><span>Plug the power back in and power on.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Again, please post back and let us know how it goes so we can help you guys get the issue sorted! :)</span></p>

<p>Hello. &nbsp;Sorry for the long delay. &nbsp; I think the issue may revolve around it being installed on my USB device . &nbsp;Perhaps, it didn't fully pass certification for running on a USB device, since it was just the extended cut version. &nbsp;Only the extra part would
 crash.</p>
<p>The way I fixed the issue, was to put the game on the internal drive. &nbsp;Once I did that, it made it past the cutscene fine, and I was able to complete the last 2 achievements. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I seriously doubt it was a corrupt installation, or a cache issue. &nbsp; When it was on my USB drive, I would notice it didn't want to transfer the extended level data properly ( It took extra time loading ), and I can only assume it was not handling the memory
 of the added content properly? &nbsp; &nbsp;Just speculation.</p>

    <title>Robocopy infinite recursion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmac150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Robocopy infinite recursion</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have been using Robocopy for years to backup my system. However, since I upgraded, Robocopy goes into a seemingly infinite loop, when backing up via the Documents and Settings Junction.</p>
<p>I have not changed the permissions on this folder, nor on the C:Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Application Data folder which is also involved.</p>
<p>If I show Operating System folders and try to open these folders, I get "Access Denied", as I would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the /XJ option in Robocopy, I will not be able to back up via junctions that I have set up to access data on a separate data drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>It has been more than 10 days since I installed the April update so Windows won't let me de-install.&nbsp; Is there any way around this so I can roll back until they fix it?</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help.</p>

                    <span>
<p>So I recently installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit onto my SSD. I intend to use my SSD for games and programs that require speed, and a 1tb HDD for storage of other stuff. So I went to move the My Documents folder to my storage drive, but accidentally made
 the storage drive the location for My Documents.</p>
<p>My Documents is no longer under my user folder or on the desktop, so i can't reset it that way. Is there some other way of putting it back to default?</p>

<p>You can use the registry to fix the association under the following path:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I recommend that you use System Restore instead because it will be a more complete restoration of the settings, and will not carry any risk of losing files or making failed registry changes. &nbsp;To use System Restore, just type 'restore' into your
 Start menu.</p>

<h2>            Backwards compatibility not working..</h2>
                    <p>just bought a brand new Xbox one s console yesterday, and none of my 360 games do anything when I insert them. &nbsp;I've tried gears of war 1-3, assassins creed 1-3, hall 3 and 4. &nbsp;Plus others that I've verified are on the list of being compatible. &nbsp;Not sure
 if anyone has had this issue, but it's like my console can't read the disc. &nbsp;It makes noises like it's trying to read it for a few seconds then goes silent. &nbsp;Any help or suggestions is appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

<p>First of all, make sure the console is connected online properly, as the 360 game discs are there "only" as a proof of purchase. The actual backwards compatible game has to be downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace by the console automatically, as soon
 as it detects the disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for the console to detect the disc, the security sector of the disc has to be readable. The actual data of the game can be scratched or otherwise unreadable, the only important thing for the Xbox One has to be the security sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please try the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eject your Xbox 360 game disc, and then hold the power button on the console for about 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the console has shut down, press the power button again to turn the console back on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the console starts, check that it shows a green boot screen with the Xbox One logo. If the green boot screen does not appear, hold the power button for 20 seconds again, and restart the console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the green boot screen shows, it can take some time for the console to start up. So take your Xbox 360 game disc to the kitchen in the mean time, and apply a small drop of mild dish washer soap to the silver side of the disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With wet fingers, "massage" the soap around the silver surface of the disc, until the whole silver side is covered in soap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From now on, hold the disc with your index finger in the center hole, and with your thumb on the edge of the disc only!</p>
<p>Rinse the disc under running water to get the soap off. Then shake the disc several times, and wipe the remaining water drops with a soft, lint-free cloth. If you have someone in the family wearing glasses, the cleaning cloth for such glasses would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with the clean disc, return to your console, make sure the console is connected online, and updated, and then insert the disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check that the game tile appears with a disc icon in the corner. The console should then start to download the game from the Xbox Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console does not detect the game disc, check if the console can read a movie DVD (not a BluRay disc). If the console continues to fail reading movie DVDs or all Xbox 360 game discs, but works with BluRay movies and Xbox One game discs, it might be
 that your console's disc drive is faulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that case you would have to sign up the console for repair at&nbsp;<a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://devicesupport.microsoft.com</a></p>

<h2>            Skype uses the wrong audio source</h2>
                    <p>I have my USB audio speakers selected as my main audio source on Skype and on my OS in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However no matter what I do, Skype reverts to my laptop speakers for no apparent reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of a call I can change the speaker settings and then put it back to my main USB one and then it works but despite them being the default it doesn't seem to work. This problem only applies to Skype and nothing else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember it being a problem with the standard Skype software. Is this a known issue with the Windows 10 Skype app?</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to further check this before we conclude that it is an issue with the app. Skype for Windows 10 uses the standard system settings of your device, as their is no native settings which we can configure in Skype for Windows
 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to do the following so we can isolate the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check for updates for your Skype application. The latest version of Skype for Windows 10 is v.11.19.805
</li><li>Make sure that your drivers are up-to-date. You may want to check <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15054/windows-7-automatically-get-recommended-drivers-updates-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> on
 how to automatically get updates for your hardware.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know what happens after updating your app and your drivers so we can investigate this further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I found out the cause of it - while my audio output was the default sound device in Windows and was also purposefully selected as the audio source in Skype, I saw it wasn't set as the default 'communications' device in Windows settings which nullified
 all other settings. I changed it and now it plays out of the speakers when testing on Skype when selecting default device (before default device played no sounds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bit confusing to have options which are ignored and overridden elsewhere but at least it looks like the problem is solved.</p>

<p>I tried default device changing (from USB speakers to headphones) in Sound on the control panel and no change - Skype still uses the USB device. When I disabled the USB device and set the headphones as default I had no sound at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to restart the PC as I am in&nbsp; Skype call. The old version of Skype had a nice option to select Audio devices - has this gone? I can't find it on the three dots.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Apps are unable to launch</h2>
                    My windows 10 apps like Mail, Skype, Photos, Movies &amp; TV, Groove music, Edge, Camera, Contact support etc. are unable to launch. They were perfectly working since i upgraded to windows 10. but from last 2 days they are not even launching. When i open my
 any of these apps it appears for a moment and disappears from the screen. I also didn't find it in a task manager after opening any of them.

<blockquote>To uninstall DVD-RAM Driver Software/BD Driver Software, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.Click on start, type device manager&nbsp; in search box.<br />
2. Goto device manager, select DVD/CD-rom drives,and double click. <br />
3. Right click on the driver, and uninstall.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
This does not solve the problem. The Windows 7 upgrade still stops because it sees "DVD-RAM Driver Software/BD Driver Software" installed, even though it is unlisted in both the programs list and device manager. I&nbsp; uninstalled Nero 7 Essentials and any other
 program that might have been associated with DVD-RAM and ran CCleaner on my registry. Researching the issue it seems to have been a problem for people for more than a year (for Vista, too) and no one has a solution aside from running a clean install instead
 of an upgrade, which I am not going to do.<br />
<br />
<strong>UPDATE: </strong>I spoke with a Microsoft Tech over the phone who helped me through Easy Assist. The problem was discovered in my 32-bit Program Files folder, a subfolder that was actually called "DVD-RAM" I can't believe I didn't find on my own. It
 was a leftover from when I used one of those DVD-RAM camcorders about three years ago. We just deleted the whole folder and the problem is gone!<br />

<p>Hi MHGEX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I failed to reproduce this issue in my lab. Please make sure you <strong>Send Update</strong>&nbsp;the entire series after changing Meeting Options. Meanwhile, you can try to re-enable the Skype meeting add-in in Outlook client&nbsp;via
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt;<strong> Add-ins </strong>&gt; <strong>
Go&nbsp;</strong>to check if it helps. If it doesn't work, you may need to recreate the Skype recurring meeting since the Meeting Options feature is only available in Outlook desktop client.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Show remote cursor during screen sharing</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">
I've used TeamViewer for years, now would like to switch fully to Skype for Business.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">
One of the key functionalities I use with Teamviewer is that I look at other people's screen and I can click on it to pin point them on where to look / focus on their screen.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">
I can't find this function in Skype for Business. Can anybody tell me if it is available?</p>

            Hi Perry,<br />
<br />
The answer is yes. In Skype for business online services, if you want to see other Skype for Business users’ screen and control it, you can use the Desktop Sharing and Give Control features to achieve it. For more information about the features, please see
 the following article.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-screen-in-Skype-for-Business-2d436dc9-d092-4ef1-83f1-dd9f7a7cd3fc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Share your screen in Skype for Business</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please Note: </strong>The features are available for the major Office 365 for Business subscriptions except Office 365 K1 plan. You can also check it via this article:

However, if you only recently changed your Microsoft Account region, it takes us up to 96 hours to receive and process new information, so if you only recently made this change, we have not yet received it. If you have recently migrated your Microsoft Account back to the UK&nbsp;region from the US, then you should receive a deposit with our end of month deposit. Since you are above the 5,000 Credit amount required to schedule an automatic deposit, our system will continue to force a deposit until it is successful, so you were automatically scheduled for the next available deposit when your previous one failed.</p>

<p>Hey there Techn9cian 816 this could be too do with your network address translation otherwise known as NAT, Sometimes the reason why you cannot connect to other people on Xbox live is because they have a Moderate to strict NAT Setting, have you checked all
 of your settings? On Xbox and your router configuration page? otherwise i suggest you open up some ports on your router these being &nbsp;</p>
<p>* TCP 80<br />
* UDP 88<br />
* UDP 3074<br />
* TCP 3074<br />
* UDP 53<br />
* TCP 53</p>
<p>Thats what the ports are.</p>
<p><span>In the address bar type in your routers IP address. It should be default at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1. When you're prompted for a password you have found it =P. If you haven't changed it the username and password should both be admin, and admin.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Step 3:</b><span>&nbsp;USING DMZ When you enter into your router config window, you need to find the Tab DMZ, it should be under applications and gaming if you are using Linksys. Once you find the DMZ tab, click enable and type in the last digits of your XBOX
 into the box below. Yes when you do this you are opening all the ports on your Xbox, which is insecure, but show me someone that has hacked into an xbox 360!</span><br />
<br />
<b>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE SETTINGS!</b><br />
<br />
<b>Step 4:</b><span>Using Port Forwarding After you have enabled DMZ, find the Port Forwarding tab, which should be under advanced routing. For the name type in XBL or whatever you want, and for port range put 87 to 89, choose UDP, then your XBOX last digits
 and enable. Then do 3073 to 3075 choose TCP, then your XBOX last digits and enable. Then again do 3073 to 3075 choose UDP, then your XBOX last digits, and enable.</span><br />
<br />
<b>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE SETTINGS</b><br />
<br />
<b>Step 5:</b><span>&nbsp;Using UPnP This is just in case. Go into UPnP forwarding and enter the same stuff you did for Step 4.</span><br />
<span>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE SETTINGS</span><br />
<br />
<b>Step 6:</b><span>&nbsp;Now logout of your router config. Unplug your router and modem from the power, then plug in the router 1st, wait 30 seconds. Then plug in the modem and wait at least 2 minutes. If you don't do these hard restarts it might not work!</span><br />
<br />
<b>Step 7:</b><span>&nbsp;Restart your Xbox and go to the system blade, choose network settings, then test connection. This may take a bit, but when it gets down to NAT type it should say OPEN. If not, sorry. You can just undo all the settings we changed, you can
 just uncheck enabled on the port forwarding. Or if you want to restore your router to the factory defaults just push the reset button on the back of it.</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span>Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked... ports can be blocked in your router,
<strong><em>modem</em></strong>, or <em><strong>at your ISP</strong></em>. Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs use, you can't see the effect of a port blockage
<em><strong>except on the Xbox</strong></em>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing a port blockage:</span></p>
<p><span>1) turn off the Xbox then</span></p>
<p><span>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</span></p>
<p><span>3) unplug power from the modem.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem (or gateway) power.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem (or gateway) which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a
 modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that light says it's ready, skip step 6.</span></p>

<p>Thanks I have tried opening the ports but my friend hasn't yet so hopefully that will resolve the issues.</p>
<p>But in response to taidara I am in Kansas. I have a netgear wndr3700v2 router. I have tried turning on and off UPnP to open NAT which it did, so my NAT is now open. When I test my connection to xbox live it doesn't come up with any errors. Just when I try
 to join specific parties a message pops up "can't connect to xbox live party" and I can't join games with those specific people either</p>

<p>Well, NAT may be improved, but there's still some degree of port blockage. If the port clearance process I recommended didn't fix it, then we need to confirm how many Xbox 360 consoles you have in the house before proceeding further.&nbsp;Once we know if there's
 only one, then setting up Port Forwarding as per &nbsp;<a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Netgear/WNDR3700/Xbox_Live_360.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Netgear/WNDR3700/Xbox_Live_360.htm</a>&nbsp;and disabling
 UPnP would be the next step.</p>

<p>This sometimes happens to me. What we did was turn off Xbox's, unplug the router u know the rest. &nbsp; After that we could connect. Also heard if your routers firmware is outdated this problem happens. Try updating &nbsp;your router's firmware at the manufacturers
 site. Check your xbox dashboard settings and make sure you have the privacy settings to allowed.</p>
<p>My were for some reason set to "not allow" public to view and voice chat. Or have someone else start a party and have them invite you. Thats what we mostly did.</p>

<p>Hey there, Techn9cian 816. If you are at college then that might be the source of the issue. You might want to contact your college's technical support to see if they're blocking any ports. Can you check into this for us? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You can't link an offline account with an already online account. If you wish to make an offline account an online account you'd need to login to your console with the offline account and push the middle button on your Xbox 360 controller and go to Join Xbox
 LIVE. You'll need to enter a Microsoft Account e-mail that does not have an e-mail associated with it. When that process is complete you'll end up with a randomly generated gamertag&nbsp;with all of the offline achievements transferred to an online account.<br />
<br />
You can then change that gamertag&nbsp;one time for free within the first 30 days of the account creation if you wish to do so. However, it's not possible to merge accounts at all which is what I believe you wish to do.<br />
<br />
<strong>Translation:<br />
<br />
</strong>Olá,<br />
<br />
Você não pode vincular uma conta off-line com uma conta já online. Se você deseja fazer uma conta off-line uma conta on-line você precisa fazer o login para o seu console com a conta off-line e apertar o botão do meio no seu controlador Xbox 360 e vá para Aderir
 Xbox LIVE. Você precisa inserir uma conta de e-mail Microsoft que não tem um e-mail associado a ela. Quando esse processo for concluído, você vai acabar com um gamertag gerado aleatoriamente com todas as conquistas off-line transferidos para uma conta online.<br />
<br />
Você pode então mudar essa gamertag uma vez de graça nos primeiros 30 dias da criação da conta, se desejar fazê-lo. No entanto, não é possível mesclar contas em tudo que é o que eu acredito que você deseja fazer.</p>
