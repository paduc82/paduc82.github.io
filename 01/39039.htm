<h2>            Windows 10 SSD&#47;HDD problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated my Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>During the installation process, I were forced to install the OS on the HDD, I´d prefer to use the SSD (Samsung 840), however it said something about it not being compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now wiped the SSD and tried to factory reset the Windows 10, and it just automatically installed the OS once again on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Loop</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday I upgraded my Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10, and everything was fine until a couple hours ago. I was playing Earthbound on a SNES emulator playing around with resolutions when my laptop suddenly turns off. I assumed it was because I forgot
 to plug in the charger, as I usually do that, but when I plugged it in and turned it back on, I was not greeted by the usual system resume screen, I was greeted by this:&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you upgraded less than 30 days ago you should be able to revert back. However<br />
what we don't know is if this is a hardware caused issue and what that will do to<br />
an attempted revision.<br />

    <title>Lost an important file after the automatic Windows 10 Anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cchow5313  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost an important file after the automatic Windows 10 Anniversary update &#40;version 1607&#41; overnight</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I've been using Windows 10 since November of 2015 on my 2 Dell Precision M6800 laptops. Both Machines received a download and of the latest Windows 10 Anniversary update (version 1607) (KB3176929) overnight. This morning, I have
 to restart the machines and waited for them to complete the installation. After that process was completed, I rebooted the machines, and discovered the following 2 major issues:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">1. My QuickBooks Company File (.qbw) has been completely wiped off my computer. Neither I or QuickBooks tech support was able to locate the file anywhere in my system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">2. The 2 machines were networking together prior to the update and since the update, I was no longer able to maintain the networking of the 2 machines. Even though the Network Discovery setting for both machines were set to "ON'
 and the 'Sharing' functions were turned on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I have since uninstalled the Windows 10 Anniversary update (version 1607) and rolled back both machines by way of the '<strong>Go back to an earlier build' process.&nbsp;</strong>Both machines are now back on Windows 10 to the previous
 version 1511. I was able to re-establish the networking of the 2 machines. However, the QuickBooks company file is still missing and nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">QuickBooks tech support thought may be the file got moved/placed to a Windows.old folder during the update, but we can't find the Windows.old folder anywhere, both after the update and after I rolled back the update to the previous
 Window 10 version. They suggested that I reached out to Microsoft tech support.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Unfortunately, after speaking with Microsoft on 3 different calls and with 3 different agents, they all basically told me they
<strong>'DO NOT’ </strong>support any third party program that’s installed on my machines and there is nothing they can do for me. (Even though the files was dumped during the latest Windows 10 update).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I ended up having to reload the Quickbooks.qbw file that I had backed up from a week ago. The down side is that I now have to renter a week’s worth of business data into Quickbooks (invoices, billing, labor hours etc..)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Has anyone experienced anything like I did as a result of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I have since turned off the ‘Windows Automatic Update’ function until I know this will not happen again in future update.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<h2>            Inspiron M531R 5535 with Realtek Audio and Windows 10.  Microphone does not recognize speech on skype or any application.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows 10 and I've my fair share of issues using it. The biggest problem for me is that my laptop microphone isn't recognizing my voice or any audio whatsoever. I recently contacted Dell and they said that they were working on drivers that
 would fix the problem and just recently I went to the Device Manager and manually selected the Realtek microphone device and clicked to update software online. It downloaded and installed the driver and I went to the Realtek audio control panel and there were
 no blanks in the tabs anymore and you could customize both the speaker and microphone. I checked Skype with both a headset and no headset but all I hear is a bunch of static. I can't revert back to Win 8.1 unfortunately and using skype on my computer is very
 essential for me to get things done. If anyone has the solution for this I'd be really grateful. It's very frustrating that it doesn't work and the tutorials I have searched for do not work as well.</p>

<h3> rich5578  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate stuck on 18&#37; epanding files.</h2>
                    I bought the full retail version of windows 7 ultimate to be delivered on the release day. I still have not managed to get it installed!<br />
<br />
I am trying to upgrade from vista home premium 64bit OEM to windows 7 ultimate 64bit. I have tried everything recommended, as in uninstalling software and removing unrecognisable hardware. I always get as far as the first re-boot followed by expanding files
 18% but never further. I really am loath to install from scratch and want to upgrade. Any ideas?

            Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.&nbsp;
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor
</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Disable all security software: anti-virus, firewall etc. Remember to enable afterwords.&nbsp;
<br />
3. Make sure your computer has the most recent BIOS and drivers. Updating the BIOS can be risky, only do this if nothing else works.&nbsp;
<br />
4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing.&nbsp; <br />
5. If using a video card and the computer has integrated video use that and remove the video card.&nbsp;
<br />
6. Unplug your computer from the internet, if you have wireless disable it.&nbsp; <br />
7. RAM (memory) - reduce the amount of RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful. Also if you just added new RAM make sure it's compatible.&nbsp;
<br />
8. If you have multiple hard drives remove all except the one you're installing Windows 7 on, then replace after Windows 7 is installed.&nbsp;
<br />
9. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.
<br />
10. If you clicked on "Upgrade" to start the install make sure you are taking a supported upgrade path. You can NOT do an in place upgrade: A) XP to Windows 7, B) changing bit type - 32 to 64 bit, C) changing languages, D) downgrading editions ex:Vista Ult.
 to 7 Pro, or E) Vista Home to 7 Pro. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
11. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. May take awhile, only do if nothing else worked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Choose your language, then click Next.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
12. Disable Startup Programs:&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            &#34;elementModuleHeaderText&#34; in Windows Update.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have windows 7 Professional with SP1 with 16GB ram and i7 CPU, and I'm using MS Security Essentials.<br />
When I go to Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Update<br />
<br />
I get this weird screen attached below.<br />
<br />
I spent hours online finding information in similar threads about this error but no success.<br />
<br />
I read in some threads it might have to do with MUI (multi language) so maybe it's a lead but I seriously don't know what to do.<br />
<br />
If anyone can please help I would appreciate it very much.<br />
<br />
Best.<br />
M<br />

<p>Thank you for the clarification. Optional Features are mostly intended for for business networks and servers. Other features can also be used by developers for making/developing apps or games which Graphics Tools and Windows Developer Tools can be used.
 So almost similar on my first reply, enabling these features will depend on how you need them, if you are trying to develop apps/programs, then this tools will definitely be a big help.</p>

<h2>            usb controller&#58; Unknown Device next to a yellow question mark</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mid last year had a system crashed, rebuilt and has been working fine since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only USB connections made since then was with my tablet to transfer images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the crash, it worked fine with connection to the Conon EOS Utility Desktop solution software to transfer images from the camera to the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since rebuilt have not used this function but tried it a few days back it does not recognize the Original Title:</p>
<p>usb controller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>connection. Moreover I tried to use a USB SD card reader but no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only two items that worked are the tablet and a regular USB stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a yellow question mark infront of the USB Controller in the Other Devices section. Tried to reinstall error not finding it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not able to use the original CD from Dell as all drivers are for SP1 and I am noe on SP3 version 5.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>No, BIOS is different from chipset.</p>

<p>The term <i>chipset</i> is commonly used to refer to a set of specialized chips on a computer's motherboard or an expansion card.</p>

            <p>You can run anything "as admin" by right-clicking it.&nbsp; For example, open your search box and type "power", then right-click PowerShell and choose "Run as admin".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS. This only works when right-clicking programs that can actually <em>run</em>. Things like files, Word Documents, etc, can't be "ran", only opened.&nbsp; But you can go to the program itself (like Word) and run it as admin.</p>

<h2>            &#37;WSERPROFILE&#37; folder keeps appearing on desktop and in &#92;user&#92;application data&#92;microsoft folder</h2>
                    <p>Using xp pro x32 sp3. I have a strange/unknown folder that keeps re-appearing even after deleting. it is a "%WSERPROFILE%" folder, with the % symbols around it. This folder appears on my desktop and in the \user\apps data folder. Won't let me delete unless
 I log in as another user. When I log back in as my user, the folder re-appears. Scan malware and anti-virus&nbsp;= clean.</p>
<p>Contents of folder are Microsoft and 2 sub-dirs: CryptnetUrlCache, and SystemCertificates
</p>
<p>ex:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\%WSERPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\%WSERPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\MetaData</p>
<p>each of these has 18 files in the form of : 1B9435E949F2B3D267BABDE0C8BC19A6 (content looks like url and certificate path) like this one:</p>
<p>h t t p : / / c r l . v e r i s i g n . c o m / p c a 3 - g 5 . c r l </p>
<p>I am not sure how this started or what is generating these directories and if they are even needed. Don't seem to be causing any negative effects on my pc, but I like to know where unknown folders are coming from. Anyone have seen this or have any idea what
 this is?</p>

            <div>Hi koolch,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Do you use Internet Explorer as the browser?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state to check the application causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall
 and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><span>Here’s&nbsp;an article you may refer to, for steps with reference to the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned here:</span></p>
<p><b><span>To configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;</span><span>Click <span>Start</span>, and then click <span>Run</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;</span><span>Type msconfig, and then click <span>OK</span>. The <span>
System Configuration Utility</span> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;</span><span>Click the <span>General</span> tab, click <span>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;</span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><span>This </span><span>Cryptnet is a system certificate.
</span><span>The CryptoAPI certificate no longer uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer cache (Wininet.dll). Instead, it maintains a separate disk cache at the following location: C:\Documents and Settings\user name\Application Data\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache.</span></p>
<p><span>Hence, I would suggest you to delete this certificate and check if that helps.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the advise, Divya.</p>
<p>I tried Method&nbsp;1 with no luck. After several hours spent on this iussue, I got frustrated that I could not determine the root cause. I did learn a few tricks which will help me in th future.</p>
<p>So, rather than keep trying to fix the reappearing folder issue, I luckily use acronis backup and found a backup that did not have this issue (was about 4 months ago). So far, the problem has not occurred. I will now be able to reinstall patches and softwares
 as I update my pc and will keep an eye out for what might have been causing this %WSERPROFILE% folder to show up on my pc. If it reappears and I know what caused it, I will most certainly post back here for anyone else.</p>
<p>Sorry, never made it to Method 2, so dont know if that would have helped.</p>

 thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or is there a way to block Windows 8.1 from installing? I could just go back to running W/8.</p>

<p><strong>We scanned photos from our printer into our Toshiba Laptop. &nbsp;The Import Dialogue Box comes up to ask us to continue importing. &nbsp;After clicking OK, the scanning continues. &nbsp;After the photo is imported, we want to close the dialogue box but it won't
 close. &nbsp;We can only minimize it. &nbsp;Then after we shutdown the computer will the dialogue box go away. &nbsp;Thoughts?</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using any third party application to import photos in windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to change import settings and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect the scanner to your computer by using a USB cable, and then turn on the scanner.<br />
</span><span>2.&nbsp;In the
<strong><span>AutoPlay</span></strong> dialog box that appears, click
<span><strong>Import pictures and videos using </strong></span><span><strong>Windows</strong></span>.<br />
</span><span>3.&nbsp;To change the settings that are used when importing pictures and videos, click
<strong><span>Import settings</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>Import Pictures and Videos</span></strong> dialog box.<br />
</span><span>4.&nbsp;Change one or more settings in the
<strong><span>Import Settings</span></strong> dialog box, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
</span><span>5.&nbsp;Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> to restart Import Pictures and Videos. Type a tag in the
<strong><span>Tag these pictures (optional)</span></strong> box, and then click
<strong><span>Import</span></strong> to import your pictures
<br />
and videos using the new settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the import box closes after importing pictures.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link:<br />
</span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-importing-pictures-and-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-importing-pictures-and-videos</a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, disable any security software and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:
</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus<br />
software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the
<br />
Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<br />
Power cycle the device and then check the account to see if they arrived on the account.
<br />
<br />
You may also want to contact Microsoft or more helpfully, epic games, about this issue since this more than likely requires either account access or knowledge of the payment models.

            Too add onto this post, I direct you to the epic games forums here where a community manager answered a question that may help you: <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/royale-with-cheese/314044-can-i-buy-v-bucks-on-the-windows-store-and-use-it-on-the-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battl...</a>
<br />
<br />He said "the Windows Store can only purchase V-Bucks on Xbox. However, if your account is linked, you should be able to sync what you purchased with your V-Bucks with PC (though some people are having platform account specific issues with Xbox)."
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to link my LinkedIn account to my Contacts/People hub. I've got the new 950 on Windows 10. I've downloaded LinkedIn and go to settings where it asks me to sync my contacts, I click that and it takes me to the account settings where (according
 to the below page) it should appear. However, nothing appears there and syncing via the app just takes you to the page where it's not possible to add LinkedIn.</p>

            If you have third party shell extensions installed, it could be the reason why. Use ShellEx by Nirsoft to find and remove the offending extension.

    <title>iPod nano 7 and Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveyboy_980  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPod nano 7 and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>The posts on here are pretty ancient, so is there anyone who can successfully sync a nano 7 with WMP?&nbsp; The only solution I see is to maintain two databases, one for WMP and one for iTunes, my library is some 50,000 songs now so that uses an awful lot of
 disc space.</p>
<p>I use WMP because it is easy to get songs plus sleeve info into Android, I use iTunes because the UI is superior and it syncs with my nano and&nbsp;shuffle.</p>

                    On my Samsung S4 (Android 5.0.1)I can no longer call familiar local numbers on Skype - "The number you were trying to call is invalid". Invited to Chat&nbsp; "with a person" I keep either encountering an error - "Please try again" - or I get directed back to
 Community. None of previous answers to this question have been at all helfpul.

</p><p>This normally happens if the local network carrier doesn't recognize a call from&nbsp;Skype users. In this case, I suggest you to set up a caller ID on your Skype account, just utilize this FAQ link for the complete steps:

Thanks, I tried that, but it looks as if I neglected to put in the country code for local calls! The old version put them in automatically. Anyway thanks for the answer - and I now have a caller ID!
