<h2>            Xbox one shutting off by itself and quick access menu popping up on its own</h2>
                    <p>for a while now whenever my Xbox one s is plugged into the internet it occasionally shuts off without warning. The quick access menu also pops up randomly and rapidly over and over. Is there anyone else with these problem and is there’s any way for me to fix this.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I am sorry to say but the problem is still occurring, I have made sure that my console can vent and I even tried plugging it right into a new outlet in case it was a problem with my power strip. I also still have the problem with the center button being pressed on my controller without input&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Games can&#39;t always fully handle keyboard and mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadaml  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games can&#39;t always fully handle keyboard and mouse</h2>
                    <p>For a long time now, I have an issue where the keyboard doesn't functions well. I tried different things, but most of the time restarting the PC (at times several times) did fixed it, however it seems to stuck in this faulty state now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Issue</strong></p>
<p>To better understand what is the issue, I made an XNA program to display what input is being registered, and found something really funky:</p>
<p>- Every input works as it should, but when I press a key, mouse buttons are no longer registered, until a certain point (that point is described in a later point)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;In case if this info helps reveal what is the issue the&nbsp;keys that get registered are: Escape, Tab, Caps lock, Both Shift, Both&nbsp;Control, Both alt, Windows key (the keyboard doesn't have a right windows key), Enter and Numpad enter, Backspace, Home, Pause,
 Numlock.</p>
<p>- When I press and hold down a key, and switch the application specifically with the Windows key, the key gets registered in that instance, and if I switch back by closing the start menu with the keyboard while the key is still held down, the application
 still registers that keyboard input, but the mouse buttons&nbsp;still doesn't function, and no other key in addition of the already functioning one gets registered. If I release the key, the key gets released, but the keyboard still functions the same way. (So
 the key&nbsp;ups get registered, but not the downs? I can't test this with XNA.)</p>
<p>- If I switch the application with the start menu, the XNA program fully regains the mouse, but the keyboard behaves the same way, and can mess the mouse once again.</p>
<p>** This makes me feel like if something gets stuck in the input queue.</p>
<p>- I have a drawing tablet which also can send modifier keys (alt, shift, ctrl) and those gets registered in the game but also messes up the mouse as if I'm pressing the keyboard.</p>
<p>- The gamepad is unaffected by this issue but in games like&nbsp;Stardew Valley it cannot control the mouse with the thumb sticks once a key was pressed. I assume the mouse position cannot be changed programmatically from that point on. (This may be a key thing
 IMHO.)</p>
<p>- Games utilizing any other means of input querying can still fully use the keyboard through those methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programming wise, sadly that's all I could do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Input behavior in some games (and library it is using, if I'm aware of it):</strong></p>
<p>- Undertale (XInput) - Menu works, can quit with the escape key, can't navigate in the&nbsp;Gamepad configuration, main character cannot be moved.</p>
<p>- Aquaria (SDL(1) - unsure what&nbsp;the library&nbsp;uses)&nbsp;- Pressing any&nbsp;key will causes mouse movement to drift with movement, like if that point got fixed, and mouse movement is captured relative to that point.</p>
<p>- Stardew Valley (XNA) -&nbsp;The keyboard isn't fully functional, and after a key press, neither can click with&nbsp;the mouse, or move the cursor with the thumb sticks.</p>
<p>- Dust: An elisian tail (XNA) - Exactly the same thing as I've noticed with my test program minus I don't see what keys are being pressed.</p>
<p>- XInput demo I've downloaded from an MS site I can't remember&nbsp;(XInput) - The only key it used worked, but it was polling it through the WinAPI, and did not utilized the mouse, so it was a useless test. (But the gamepad works! :P It was a&nbsp;Joystick demo after
 all.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What have I tried</strong></p>
<p>I have tried to:</p>
<p>- Restart my PC several times</p>
<p>- Uninstall and reinstall many programs that potentially could mess up the keyboard input</p>
<p>- Switching the USB port my keyboard is plugged in to</p>
<p>- Using different keyboards (as of writing this, I have not yet tried to use a bluetooth keyboard)</p>
<p>- Remove any hardware that can conflict with keyboard input (Drawing tablet, Gamepad, KVM switch)</p>
<p>- Update any possible driver I can think of</p>
<p>- Update my system</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turned my&nbsp;Windows system&nbsp;account to a local account, and unassigned my Microsoft account.&nbsp;(I was kind of desperate at this point, but I'm also part of the Insider program and thought that could make a difference).</p>
<p>- Disable/Quit BOINC manager during a game. (My PC can handle it and proved it while using Win7)</p>
<p>- Updating Java RE</p>
<p>- Disable and close Synergy (during this attempt, I've accidentally assigned Adobe Reader to *.BAK files. now it is assigned to a now non-existent once 0b in size "EMPTY.EXE" -- the best solution I find to remove the association.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While ConEmu is a great program IMHO, and worked well with games while using Windows 7, I am not sure it did not had an affect on my system. I did tried to remove it with no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NOT tried to reinstall my system as it is a great hassle for me to fully reinstall my PC with all the programs I have. Maybe I am doing something wrong but it takes years for me to fully reinstall and reconfigure my PC and this solution does not seem
 in the same weight as my issue&nbsp;and so&nbsp;it is not an appealing solution for me.&nbsp;So I want to use this method in the lastest of last resort, like "nothing works".</p>
<p>I also did not tried this with a different user account. I don't quite like the idea to recreate my user account in a different one so just I could fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my XNA test program over another Win10 PC, on which it was fully functional&nbsp;without the issues I've described above, so this meant for me that this issue is related to my setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume DirectX installation is may be corrupt but it is ironed in the system, so I cannot do anything with it. (Repair/Reinstall)</p>
<p>I can also imagine that there is some rights issue somewhere in my system. (under Windows,&nbsp;Program Files, ProgramData or Users&nbsp;folders.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I play with a gamepad, but there are some games that cannot be played with a gamepad.</p>
<p>One thing I could have tested is if I do not press any keyboard keys during any game (regardless of playing any game), and THEN I restart the PC, would it restore it to a functional state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While things keep popping in to my head what can I do with this, I do not have any idea for a solution on this matter. Can anybody help with me on this? Perhaps a bug hunting session with a Microsoft representative (if appropriate)?</p>
<p>Seeing the internet having many who had similar issues, I believe by tackling with this I could help fix this issue permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is:</p>
<p>- Win 10 (Upgraded from Win 7 -- had no issue during that time, and my PC <em>
was </em>blazing fast)</p>
<p>- Intel Core i7-4820K</p>
<p>- 16 GB ram</p>
<p>- GeForce GTX 780</p>
<p>- ~200+GB SSD &amp; 2TB HDD</p>
<p>- I mainly use a wireless Logitech keyboard-mouse duo mk720</p>
<p>- wired XBox 360 controller</p>
<p>- Wacom Intuos Pro</p>
<p>-&nbsp;I've set up my PC to use D:\Users and D:\ProgramData during Windows installation with audit mode, to make the SSD last longer by making Windows access it less. I only wanted to make windows boot faster, nothing else.&nbsp;Otherwise I should avoid using&nbsp;too
 often&nbsp;the My Documents folder and changing program&nbsp;configurations, which I do not like much. And I do not know what "Too Often" means.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already did the second method before I've reach out the community forum, so I take the liberty to skip that one.</p>
<p>Also I have noticed that you are linking the mk710 keyboard-mouse duo support page, not the mk720. I assume that is a typo and not actually asking me to install that? Although I believe the same software is offered for all their keyboard/mouse, so I do not
 believe it would be any different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However running the hardware trouble shooter, it keeps telling me that, to finish installing drivers and updates, restart your PC. I did that a few times with the trouble shooter, but it keeps telling me to do so. Skipping it won't give any other issues
 -- I do not know if that is a thing.</p>
<p>So it looks like if a driver or software stuck in an installing/updating state to a degree that the troubleshooter could recognize it, but it does not cause conflict installing other driver or software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled a software called ShrewSoft VPN Client that installed a network&nbsp;adapter along with the software the troubleshooter was complaining about, but it didn't changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for further help.</p>

            <p>I have removed the Logitech keyboard and mouse driver, and went ahead, and uninstalled the tablet driver as well.</p>
<p>The issue still remains both within and the end of the driver removal iterations. I even unplugged the tablet to increase the odds, but it didn't changed anything.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, I've just noticed that there is a setting for windows apps to select which partition to install them. I have changed that setting to D:\ and all of my store apps become defunct. and to fix this, I hoped that restarting would fix it, but
 it didn't. Now not even the start menu opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse, the SkypeHost.exe was constantly crashing and that invoked WerFault.exe making my Windows virtually unusable. In the end, I had disabled the Windows Error Reporting Service, which now restores my PC in a usable state, and a constant presence of a
 "SkypeHost.exe - Application Error" titled window reminds me that it is still not OK. The problem oddly resebles one that I had before except from the constantly crashing SkypeHost.exe, and the solution I ended up with was to add "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGE"
 group for one folder I can't recall (I believe it was actually a folder under %USERPROFILE% and not WindowsApps folder or anything in Windows) because the issue was actually an access denied error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although now I have diverged from the original problem creating a new one (or resurfaced an old one?) while I was hoping to do something about this in Safe Mode, I have noticed and I tried the atuo fix option (I do not recall the exact name of the option)
 and it was telling me something about a recent driver install, with error code 0xc0000225.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly believe I can track down the issue of the new problem I have (using procmon.exe), however, I find the above error possibly relevant, and helpfull (if it is really elevant).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Many application have issues accessing files/folders under the %LOCALAPPDATA%. Along that, some Windows store app fail to access their respective ActivationStore.dat file.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to fix that yet.</p>

            <p>I assume you have ran out of suggestions? Or possibly the other suggestions involves reinstalling Windows? Or perhaps gather information on the tough situation to solve? Would it make any difference, if I ask you to disregard the other issue I have?
<em>That driver installation leaves me with concerns.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am slowly accepting that reinstalling Windows might be inevitable, however due to lack of time and patience (but mostly time) I will probably have to bare with a wonky Windows until I get my self to actually do it, so if a solution is coming slowly, there
 is a good chance that it would find me before reinstalling my Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll mentally prepare for the worst possible solution in the meantime.</p>

            <p>After installing the KB3156421 update, the issue with the modern app went away. Except for Edge. I will look in to it why it isn't starting. Not sure if all other modern apps works now, but many does.</p>
<p>I hope <em>this</em> stays for the next startup. Reinstalling is posponded for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also hope the gaming issue would go away in a simmilar fashon, but as of now, it still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone have any idea, I'm open for it.</p>

            <p>I have ported my test program from XNA to use MonoGame, and lo and behold, the program using the MonoGame library worked. I started to match up the DLLs the two version uses, and noticed while the XNA version uses d3d9.dll and MonoGame uses the d3d11.dll.
 I can understand the difference, since XNA is not supported anymore (if I understood that correctly), but MonoGame is being actively developed and adapts the latest technology.</p>
<p>Otherwise I don't see any other obvious difference aside from XNA and MonoGame libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then, is it by chance possible that DX9 is wonky under Windows 10? I could understand that, since in Windows 10 have DX11 or 12 or something like that. But I would like to play my games, regardless of who considers what about the utilized technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have already have a question here, I would like to hear your response before I rush out to do something/anything addressing Win10&amp;DX9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.: My Windows 10 was upgraded from Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            How do I open and edit .xfdl files on windoes RT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was elated to think that I could use the surface RT with a CAC reader, but I noticed that there isn't much in the way of the Windows store that allows me to read and edit .xfdl files without pureEdge or lotus viewer, neither in the store.</p>

            I know this information is not exactly what you are looking for but the Army is moving away from Lotus forms and AprovIT software. The main thing you need to be looking for is if you can digitally sign documents in adobe reader. If RT allows you to do
 that then you will be good to go NLT FY2015 and probably sooner than that. I have already seen some of the forms being switches over on the Army Publishing Directorate site.

<p>Do you know if the RT version of adobe allows for a digital signature using a smart card? If so it will provide a 50% solution to the problem listed above. The person can use the PDF version of the document instead of XFDL. (The military is switching formats&nbsp;
 for all their forms this year.)</p>

<p>Hello Ninja!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I understand that the headset not being detected by your controller can be frustrating but, I will be happy to assist you with the issue. Just to clarify, have you tried to try the headsets on a different device,
 such as a phone or laptop to make sure it's not the headset with the issues? If the headset is working, I would suggest checking out this support article for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Chat Headset Troubleshooting</a>. If you still have any further questions or concerns please feel free to reply back letting us know. Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>There could be a lot of reasons causing that issue. You will want too troubleshoot the issue. For example
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the stero adapter with the headset or just pluging right into the controller 3.5mm jack? If your using the adapter is possable its faluty</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the headset on a other controller if it works then its likley the other controller auido port isnt working
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the headset on a other device such has a PC or phone if the headset to test the headset
</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<span>Method 1: Conduct basic checks on your controller and headset</span>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
Once you find the microphone can’t work on your Xbox One, the first thing you need to do is to do some basic troubleshooting.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>1)</span>&nbsp;Check if your headset is properly connected to your controller and your controller to your console. If you are not sure, try reconnecting
 your headset to your controller (plug the headset connector firmly to the port on your controller) and reconnect or resync your controller to your console.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>2)</span>&nbsp;Make sure your headset is not muted. Check the mute button on your headset control or the audio settings on your Xbox One. You may also
 need to adjust the audio settings to increase the microphone volume (this can enable your voice to be clearer and louder).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>3)</span>&nbsp;Check your devices and cables carefully and see if there is anything wrong you can see from outside. Also, you can test with another headset
 or controller, or even a different console to verify where the problem is located. If you find any hardware issue, you may need to&nbsp;<span>get
 your controller repaired or replaced</span>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<span>Method 2: Check your Xbox profile settings</span>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
Your microphone on Xbox One may be muted because your profile settings limit your voice communication. You can check your profile settings and see if the microphone on your account is being controlled.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<em>(If you are using a child account, you should sign in its parent account before you can take the steps below.)</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>1)</span>&nbsp;Press the&nbsp;<span>Xbox button</span>&nbsp;on
 your controller.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>2)</span>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>All
 Settings</span>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>3)</span>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<span>Account</span>&nbsp;and
 then&nbsp;<span>Privacy &amp; online safety</span>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>4)</span>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<span>View details &amp;
 customize</span>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>5)</span>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<span>Communicate with
 voice and text</span>&nbsp;and then select who you want to talk to (usually&nbsp;<span>your friends</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>everybody</span>).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>6)</span>&nbsp;Check to see if you can chat with your friends using the microphone.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<span>Method 3: Restart your Xbox One console completely</span>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
Your Xbox One mic not working problem may result from issues on your Xbox One console. Those issues can be fixed by a complete reboot of your console. You can restart your Xbox One console and see if this can resolve your problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>1)</span>&nbsp;Press the&nbsp;<span>Xbox button</span>&nbsp;on
 the front of your Xbox One console until it shuts down completely (this will take about 10 seconds).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>2)</span>&nbsp;Unplug the power cable from your console and leave it for about 10 seconds. This will reset the power supply of your Xbox One.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>3)</span>&nbsp;Plug the power cable to your console. Then press the Xbox button on the front of your console to power it on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
<span>4)</span>&nbsp;Check your mic and see if it works now.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<span>Method 4: Repair or replace your device</span>
<p style="color: rgba(52, 52, 52, 1)">
If you have found hardware issues, or the methods above can’t help you, you need to get your devices (your Xbox One headset, console or controller) repaired or replaced. If your devices are still under warranty, you can contact Microsoft support or the vendors
 of your devices and ask them for help.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the description, I understand that you would like to know about the Product Key for your PC running Windows 7. I will certainly help you with the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like you to know that the PC that you had before was Windows 8.1, and, the product key for Windows 8.1 can’t be used in Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Referring to your question about entering a Product Key for Windows 7, I would like you to check if Windows is already activated?</div>
<div><br />
If yes, you don’t need any product key. To check please refer to the link mentioned below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-can-i-tell-if-windows-7-is-activated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-can-i-tell-if-windows-7-is-activated</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If Windows is not activated, you would need the product key by contacting the party to whom you bought this PC.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<div><br />
Sincerely, <br />
Ankit Rajput</div>

                    <p>Recently got Windows 10, and now I can't open jpg files. I get the message "class not registered."</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Tried to change my default app for jpg files, but the only options I get are TWINUI (which is the problem) and Paint, which I don't want. Windows Photo Viewer or Microsoft Photos do not appear to be an option. Microsoft Photos says it's installed, but
 doesn't come up when I click on it. Windows Photo Viewer does not appear to be an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I try to find Microsoft Photo (thinking I will uninstall and re-install), but it doesn't show up in the list of installed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Run some sort of app troubleshooter with unhelpfully comes up with the result "Windows store cache may be corrupted - not fixed."</p>

</p><p>All I want is to be able to open a jpg file. How do I get rid of TWINUI and get my hands on an app that works?</p>

            Is there an easier way to change my default to Windows Photo Viewer rather than this TWINUI which I can clearly not put into good use? Thanks!

No I am not going to create another account so I can test. I'm a simple home user NOT a programmer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sign in for every move I make. I don't want to research this. I don't want to test. I simply want to change the default program. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. FIX IT!</p>

            First I need to know if you're concerned about keeping your albums intact. &nbsp;Your folders (where the pictures reside) are safe but the procedures to fix this may destroy both Photos' automatically created albums plus any that you've made.

<p>I agree with you, Microsoft have lost the plot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple things like changing default apps, fonts in mail etc. are made impossibly difficult or you can't!</p>
<p>And when people complain it's their fault, their PC or the way they have set it all up.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I love Windows and have been using it since 3.1.</p>
<p>In fact probably before that&nbsp; - yes I used DOS and CPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is great and it works very well, until you try and do something "different".</p>
<p>The reason I loved Windows was that you could do that and not be stuck with how Apple want you to do things.</p>
<p>Why give me an option to change my default Apps and then ignore what I have clicked on?</p>
<p>I've just installed IrfanView as the default photo viewer was taking ages to open (I had fixed it 3 times already).</p>
<p>The amount of hastle I had to just change the default viewer was ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention slow updates (that often fail), unknown data collection, support for old hardware drivers ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm sure it's all MY fault Mr. Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Some laptop keyboards do have hotkeys to disable them and there may even be something<br />
in the BIOS. Can you use an external keyboard just to make sure that works.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, on-line documentation, and their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
If all the repair shop suggested was to blow air into it they could not have been a very<br />
good shop. Where they perhaps leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox store?<br />
If so, or even if not, find a real computer shop.<br />
<br />
Can you use the keyboard as it starts to boot? Repeatedly tap F8 - Safe Mode <br />
If that works the keyboard is probably locked by something.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - keyboard - Right Click - UNINSTALL - when it clears -<br />
REBOOT <br />
<br />
Control Panel - keyboard - check settings there.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

 went on to play the game, At that time another error poped up saying that I need to install Java plug in, So didn't really know what that was but as I continued it took me to the site where I have downloaded Java before. I started to download then I cnacels
 so I could uninsatll the one I had already. So reinsatalled and got the same error again saying the I need to download Java plug in. I wnent back to the add n screen and added that Java added on that I had disabled. Restarted and tryed again still didnt work,
 so I did a recovery for early today. That did'nt work either. So could someone please help me. Thank You

            Can you just give him your log in credentials? If you need to keep the email associated with the account then I'm not aware of a way to transfer an Xbox account to another person. Some one else might come along and share their ideas.&nbsp;

            There is no way to transfer an Xbox account to some one as it is connected to your Live account. If you make your Xbox the home Xbox and set up family on that Xbox you can share all the games on there. Then your son could start his own Xbox adult account
 just for him and he can still play the games on your Xbox. You can even share Xbox Live with one other account.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. If I'm understanding you correctly, you'd like your child to know have permanent usage of the Xbox Live account that has been yours previously. There is no way at this time to transfer that information into
 a new account; however, if you'd like to simply change the email alias used for log in to free up your own, as well as manage the billing information, then there should be no problem in doing so. Just be sure that the email that you wish to use as the new
 email for log in has <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>not</em></span> been logged into a console or xbox.com or is associated with a Microsoft account already.</p>

<p>My FH2 is repeatedly freezing and returning me to the dashboard at the exact same spot, during the cut-scene after entering the first car meet. I've tried power-cycling the console as well as re-installing the game (never had any issues with other games
 on the console). I've seen a few people on other forums complaining about this issue as well.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue here.</p>
<p>It is extremely disappointing that nobody can offer a solution to a game breaking bug like this.</p>
<p>There seems to be no fix for this and I don't know what to do with my copy of the game now that it is pretty much unplayable for me now.</p>
<p>This sucks..</p>

            First, check the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Download</a>&nbsp;site for a direct download on the update that is giving you trouble. Manually download your update from the following link then&nbsp;right-click&nbsp;the
 downloaded file and&nbsp;<i>Run as Administrator</i>.&nbsp;Acknowledge&nbsp;the UAC warning and provide credentials if asked. This will grant you&nbsp;<i>elevated privileges</i>&nbsp;that may be necessary to perform system reconfiguration.

<div>If you still cannot install the update, the next recommended steps are to reset the Windows Update components and/or attempt an update from the downloaded file after performing a Clean Boot or booting into Safe Mode. A clean boot or Safe Mode environment
 is important to ensure that there are no other programs that may be locking files or otherwise&nbsp;interfering&nbsp;with the upgrade process. As this is directly related to Outlook, it is strongly advised that you do not have Outlook 2013 open.

 mode,should I restore the Reg settings first.from my back-up? This has been a problem now for months. Is it worth the trouble

How have you determined that the computer's no longer infected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is&nbsp;KB2909921, KB2916036, KB2909212 (if IE8 is installed) or, if IE10 or IE11 is installed, KB2909210 and/or KB291239 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about KB2913602, KB2893294, KB2892074 and/or KB2887069?</p>

<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with bootable diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Were all of the versions of WIndows 10 working well on that older PC?
<br />
<br />If so I would do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

            I asked if you'd had any problems with all previous versions of Windows 10?  
<br />
<br />The reason I ask is that Vista PC's are often too old to run Windows 10, and each new version makes more older hardware obsolete.

    <title>Too many ads on a game on the free game site - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Too many ads on a game on the free game site</h2>
                    <p>Why are there so many ads on the crescent solitaire.&nbsp; You watch the first ad then the cards load up, then another ad covers the board for another 14 secs (you lose points while it plays) then you finally get to the game only to have an ad in the bottom corner
 about more games.&nbsp; You have to click on that ad to x it out.&nbsp; I can see the one ad but how many do you need to watch?&nbsp; You also have the banner ads below the game so four ads on one game seem like a lot.&nbsp; Then I also have played some games where I can not
 end the ad unless I answer a question such as do I want to go to college etc.&nbsp; I don't want to be forced to answer a question I don't think it is right.</p>

<h2>            XBox One SmartGlass on Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have called today with XBox Support, but they can't help me. My Problem is, I can't play One Games on the PC with SmartGlass. I have download it on the Market but the Version Number is 2.2.1504.21038 .<br />
1. Why is in the Store XBox One SmartGlass and XBox One SmartGlass BETA !!???<br />
2. On the Support Page the newest Version is 8.8.15003.00000 but I don't get this one. I have check for Updates in the Store - nothing - I have deinstall and new install this App but the same Problem 2.2.1504.21038<br />
3. How can I get the Version 8.8.....</p>
<p>XBox One Support tell me they can't help. Microsoft Windows 10 Support tell me they can't help me....<br />
I think the better Way is sale the XBox One an go to Sony ;-)<br />
<br />
Hope you can help me. Sorry for the bad English.<br />
<br />
CU Walter</p>

<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>To stream your Xbox One to your Windows 10 PC, you'll need to use the "Xbox" app - not "Xbox Smartglass" or "Xbox Smartglass BETA". &nbsp;Try searching the store for just "Xbox".</p>
