    <title>Emails coming in a day late - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails coming in a day late</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past 3 days, my incoming emails have come in a day late.&nbsp; On Wednesday, the ones I had already received that day suddenly disappeared, leaving only the "Today" heading at the top.&nbsp; My previously received emails remained untouched.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on Thursday,
 the remaining Wednesday emails came in but Thursday's emails did not.&nbsp;Again, the "Today" heading had nothing beneath it.&nbsp; &nbsp;On Friday, all Thursday emails came in but nothing that had been sent on Friday. &nbsp;Today, Saturday, Friday emails came in but none from
 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to send out email.&nbsp; My service provider, RCN, has said that the problem is with Outlook Express, since the emails coming into my RCN gmail account are coming in on time. (Outlook Express emails, I think, come through my gmail account.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to know how to allow the emails that are supposed to come into Outlook Express &nbsp;on the day they are sent to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The problem can not be with Outlook Express, since you are *not* running Outlook Express. Outlook Express is a component of Windows XP and it can not run in Windows 7. So please clarify what e-mail program you are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Despite what they told you, I suspect that the problem is with RCN. And if you told them you were running Windows 7, and they told you the problem is with Outlook Express, they clearly don't know what they are talking about, and that doubles my suspicion
 of them.</p>

<p>No, have never gotten another reply.&nbsp; Email from Outlook is still coming in all at once a day late.&nbsp; RCN gmail comes in on time.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            There&#39;s 2</h2>
                    I was checking out which picture would look better as my profile pic on my Microsoft account (when getting set up for Skype use and such). I have 2 profile pics. I am using W8. When I go to the picture I want deleted, I attempted right clicking, nothing.
 I have tried finding a simplistic answer (since upgrades and newer versions of things are supposed to be making things "easier") and no luck. I am recuperating from back surgery and achieved two things depleting memory, focus, and concentration cells so I
 am hoping there is a simplistic, realistic, and "easy" way to remove one of these two pictures. I have attempted finding the option to remove one in my account settings, but no luck there either.&nbsp;

<p>
THIS NEEDS to be made AND kept so much simpler! There are hundreds of innocent consumers out there across the USA falling victim to dry rotted tires being sold to them as "new" that come apart and lead to accidents. Some of us have injuries sustained like gaining
 fibromyalgia and sleep apnea from the overactive nerves and redesigning of necks from whiplash type injuries stemming from the body trauma...and that's not counting back surgeries and such done from these incidents. I thought "upgrades" were supposed to make
 apps, games, and things EASIER. I'll just leave my additional one on there until I have the strength, energy, time, and patience for taking these steps. *SMH*</p>

            <span>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;Your link was for W8 and I have a W7 system. &nbsp;Regardless tried to use F12 to get to Safe
 mode but W10 evidently has bypassed the entrance to the core program. &nbsp;Have attempted several times. &nbsp;W10 just keeps on activating. &nbsp;More suggestions? &nbsp; Glad I attempted the upgrade on a spare pc before going live on my primary &nbsp;pc. &nbsp;The most frustrating factor
 is the choice of logging in using my Microsoft &nbsp;account the software not recognizing my password yet go ahywhere else and it does! Not happy.</span>

</p><p>Thanks but I had W7 on that pc prior to the W10 upgrade, not W8. &nbsp;Tried F12 to get into safe mode but W10 does not react to that. &nbsp;Just ignores it. &nbsp;Was able to get to the Asus boot software but that doesn't help either.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Photos can&#39;t share right now. Try again later.</h2>
                    For the last few days I have been trying to upload photos from my laptop to OneDrive. OneDrive does not see the photos in my picture library so I have to go through the Photos app. Every time I try to share them I get the message: Photos can't share right
 now. Try again later. I am getting extremely frustrated and nothing is fixing whatever the issue is. Any advice?

<p>My brother has had his console for about a month now and it has started freezing after having to install an update. When i get to the xbox home page it will only last for about 30 seconds before the whole console freezes, and last night I made some progress
 and was able to get in game for about 5 minutes. I really would like to know what is going on so that I can enjoy my xbox live membership.</p>

<p>Issues with your Xbox 360 console can often be resolved by removing temporary files and data from the system cache.</p>
<p>The cache stores such items as game updates, system update installation packages, and gamer pictures of your friends.</p>
<p>Clearing the cache temporarily removes: Previously downloaded game updates. You will be prompted to download these updates again the next time you try to play the games.</p>
<p>http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache</p>
<p>And you can try and download your xbox live id again</p>

<p>Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems with your Xbox 360 console. Try powering off and completely unplugging the console from power, as well as the A/V or HDMI cable and any other cables. After the console is unplugged, remove the Hard
 Drive (instructions at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a>). Once the hard drive is removed, plug in only the power cord and the A/V or HDMI cable the console, and power it on. If it doesn't freeze, try clearing the system cache (instructions at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a>). Once the cache is cleared, power off the console again, reinstall the hard drive and all other cables, and turn it back on.</p>
<p>If the console freezes even after the hard drive and all non-necessary cables (everything except Power and A/V or HDMI) are removed, your console may need to be repaired. Information and instructions on console repair can be found at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../repair-process</a>. In-warranty repairs are free, and out-of-warranty repairs are $99 plus tax if submitted online, or $119 plus tax if submitted over the phone.</p>
<p>If the console doesn't freeze when the hard drive and all non-necessary cables are removed, but freezes when everything is reinstalled after clearing the system cache, it may be an issue with the hard drive or a peripheral (such as a USB device or a Kinect
 unit) connected to the console. I hope this helps to find a solution to the issue!</p>

<p>I have tried doing what you suggested Steadfast but it keeps doing it. We don't have a hard drive eitheit r so that wasn't the problem. Every time that I start up the xbox it asks for an update, and if we do the update we have to install it 2 or 3 times
 before it will advance and even then I only stay on the dashboard for 10 to 15 seconds. And if I deny it then it will freeze when it tries to load up the dashboard.</p>

<p>Hi VizionTrickz,</p>
<p>Since you are having issues before you can even get to the dashboard can I suggest you clear the update by following these steps:</p>
<p>1. With the Xbox off, on your xbox press and hold down the Sync button&nbsp;&nbsp;(the one used to sync wireless controllers)</p>
<p>2. While holding down the sync button turn on the xbox on by using the power button on the console</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Once you reach the dashboard you can release the sync button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will go through the update process again hopefully more successfully than previous attempts.&nbsp; This is a last ditch effort but it is worth trying before you go through the repair process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it works out for you.</p>

    <title>Stuck on Getting Status - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuck on Getting Status</h2>
                    <p>So this started yesterday. Before hand everything had been working just fine. Yesterday, I tried to sign in via Chrome, it loaded up some old conversations but was stuck on 'waiting for status'&nbsp; But today when I sign in, none of my contacts load and I just
 have 'waiting for status' under my name. What I've already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Restarted computer &amp; cleared cache/cookies</li><li>Tried in another browser (FF &amp; IE)</li><li>Tried on my phone app (works)</li></ul>
<p>I'm not able to download the program on this computer unfortunately. It's getting frustrating to be honest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi im Connor <strong>[mod removed]&nbsp;</strong>and I arrived back from my vacation yesterday. I unfortunantly made the mistake of leaving my xbox at my cousins house for him to play while I wasn't using it. He thought it would be a good idea to boost my credits
 for me which isnt right and i feel bad for that but also i feel bad that i am being punished for his actions. I was wondering if you could help me lift this ban so that i can resume my gameplay</p>

<p>It's not a good idea to post your full name in a public forum.</p>
<p>If it's a ban from only Halo, then you would need to talk to Bungie about that. As far as Xbox is concerned though, your account is your responsibility at all times.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from the information that you've provided, your concern can be about a fatal error that occurred during the installation which may be caused by the following reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows Installer is attempting to install an application package that is already installed on your&nbsp;PC.</li><li>The folder that you're trying to install the Windows Installer package is encrypted.</li><li>The drive that contains the folder that you're trying to install the Windows Installer package to is accessed as a substitute drive.</li><li>The SYSTEM account does not have <strong>Full</strong> <strong>Control</strong> permissions on the folder that you are trying to install the Windows Installer package to. You notice the error message because the Windows Installer service uses the SYSTEM
 account to install software.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to resolve your concern, we suggest that you perform the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span><strong>Check if the installation package is already installed on the PC. If so, uninstall and reinstall the app.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Check from your <strong>Programs</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Features</strong> if the installation package is already installed on your computer. If yes, you may need to uninstall it first by following the steps below:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong><strong>Menu</strong>, type <strong>Control </strong>
<strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Control</strong><strong> Panel</strong>, click <strong>Uninstall </strong>
<strong>a program</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, find the application package of the said driver. Select the package, right-click, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer to complete the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Check if the downloaded file is not encrypted and doesn't have a blocked access reason.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the file and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, ensure that the attribute of the file is not on
<strong>Read-only</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Attributes</strong> section that says <strong>Security</strong>, tick the
<strong>Unblock</strong> checkbox.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the changes.

</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Ensure that your installation package is saved on the Desktop.</strong></p>
<p>Move the installation package from the download folder to your <strong>Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: </strong><span><strong>Grant Full Control permissions to the SYSTEM account.</strong></span></p>
To grant Full Control permissions to the SYSTEM account, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>File</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong> (or Windows Explorer), right-click the drive that you want to install the Windows Installer package to (this time, select the driver letter where your operating system is installed, i.e.
<strong>Drive C:</strong>), and then click &nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;tab. Verify that the&nbsp;<strong>Group or user names</strong>&nbsp;box contains the SYSTEM user account.&nbsp;If the SYSTEM user account doesn't appear in the box, follow these steps to add the SYSTEM account:
<ol>
<li>Click <span><strong>Edit</strong></span>. If prompted, approve the User Account Control.</li><li>Click <span><strong>Add</strong></span>. The <strong>Select Users or Groups</strong>&nbsp;dialog box appears.</li><li>In the <strong><span>Enter the object names to select</span></strong> field, type
<strong>SYSTEM</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<span><strong>Check names</strong>.</span></li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
</li><li>To change permissions, click&nbsp;<span><strong>Edit</strong></span>. If prompted, approve the User Account Control.</li><li>Select the <span><strong>SYSTEM</strong> </span>user account, and verify in the
<strong>Permissions</strong> section that <span><strong>Full</strong> <strong>Control</strong></span> is set to
<span><strong>Allow</strong></span>. If not, select the <span><strong>Allow</strong></span> check box.</li><li>Close the <span><strong>Permissions</strong> </span>dialog and return to the <span>
<strong>Properties</strong></span> dialog. Click <span><strong>Advanced</strong></span>.</li><li>Select <span><strong>Change</strong> <strong>permissions</strong></span>. If prompted, approve the User Account Control.</li><li>In the <span><strong>Permissions</strong></span> tab, select the <span><strong>SYSTEM</strong></span> entry and click
<span><strong>Edit</strong>. </span></li><li>Click the <span><strong>Applies</strong> to</span> drop-down and select <span>
This folder, sub-folder and files</span>.&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the operating system to apply the permissions that you have selected to all child folders.</li><li>Restart your computer and run the Windows Installer package.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the scenarios that you mentioned apply in this case. I had uninstalled the previous Intel Management Engine Interface drivers before installing the new software/drivers and also had no problems installing older versions of those drivers. I have come
 to the conclusion that the software installation for the driver package on the ASUS website might be at fault, however the detection of my OS version as 6.2 is disconcerting because 6.2 is Windows 8, and my OS is clearly Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Wireless hotspot problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arunbahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless hotspot problem</h2>
                    <div>So, for some time i had connectify for making a hostop but it kept crashing and so on, so im using seventh gate right now, its lighter performace wise. My setup is a pc and a wifi usb adapter netgear wna3100. Driver for the usb wifi adapter is updated
 to the latest version, and so are all others.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that after every reboot/waking from sleep/hibernate state, the option gets unchecked. Ill explain in the pictures.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First i have to go here&nbsp;</div>
<div>http://shrani.si/f/3P/WO/1zypCaeF/1.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then here, i have to have this checked, for seventhgate to be able to make the hotstpot.</div>
<div>http://shrani.si/f/1E/3w/30CJP70T/2.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If i do not do that and i try to make the hotstop, seventhgate puts out this error.</div>
<div>http://shrani.si/f/1B/13k/8cu3XC8/3.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Final samation, a workoaraound to get windows to remember this being checked after a reboot would be very helpful, and maybe an alternative solution to making a hotstop, just not connectify, maybe some other software that is known to work, i forgot to
 mention i need it for my android phone , which doesnt support adhoc(tried patching my android but the patch is outdated)</div>

<div><b><span>Warning: </span></b><span><br />
Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're
 done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

<h2>            Add a Bluetooth or other device does not work.</h2>
                    <p>Have just done a clean install and this issue persists so that&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">will not</span></strong> fix it.<br />
<br />
Trying to connect a controller to my PC over Bluetooth and my PC picks it up just fine, asks me to go to "Bluetooth and other devices" like it used to, no problem so far. (Bluetooth itself is fine, it picks up devices and I've reinstalled it many times to make
 sure) The "Add Bluetooth and other device" button labelled with a "+" will click in but not actually open the add device menu making it impossible for me to add the controller or infarct ANY non-wired device to my PC.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>1jimbo1,</strong></p>
<p>1. When exactly are you receiving this error message?<br />
2. Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may try booting in safe mode and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Refer the below link for more details on starting your computer in safe mode:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue doesn't recur in safe mode then, try performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</p>
<p><strong>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></p>
<p>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above KB article to narrow down the exact source.</p>
<p>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow the steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may also refer the following link and perform the online scan on your computer to check whether your computer is been infected by any virus or not.</p>

</p><p>I have went through various articles on MS forum and tried to fix by formatting. I have done sfc/scannow and all that various articles said, but this keeps repeating to the point of being very annoying</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please analyzing this memory.dmp and let me know what is the problem</p>
