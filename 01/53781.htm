    <title>Unable to perform upgrade to Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to perform upgrade to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Since Win 10 was released and my Samsung RV411 got a notice that I can download and install Win 10, I had been trying and trying yet failed each and every time. The failure can be at any stage but most of the time is during reboot where the Win logo shows
 and it just got stuck there, even for a few days. Even contacted Win online tech who tried to "rectify" my problem with no apparent solution. Finally they suggested that I try to do a clean install yet no go, just got stuck at the Win logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trolling the net for a while, finally found out that laptops running on Broadcom chip
<strong>WILL HAVE</strong> this problem and there's no solution to it at all except to replace the Wi-Fi chip. Since Samsung is no more in laptop business, meaning that they will not release a driver to solve this problem, after all, it's no more their problem.
 Thus I failed to see why Microsoft can offer an upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 yet they didn't release a patch for those who own these laptops be able to upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right at this moment am still trying to do another upgrade though I know it'll fail but then am not going to give up
<strong>YET</strong>, not yet. Maybe until the free upgrade is over then probably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyone have any solution apart from physically removing the Wi-Fi chip?(Getting old, eyesight is bad that is why I didn't do it! And where I'm located, not easy to source the part)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact
 the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturer’s website. It is the manufacturers
 who needs to deliver the updated drivers regularly.</span></p>

            <p>Dear Krishna</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please <strong>READ</strong> my comments properly as I've stated earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the upgrade way, even with 2 engineers from Redmond on the phone with me, no go. Tried the clean install or whatever is called, no go too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung already <strong>closed</strong> their laptop division so they <strong>
DO NOT</strong> care, as for Broadcom, I can't comment much as they too are very silent on this matter. So if Microsoft wants to provide us to
<strong>UPGRADE</strong>(had done this over 30 times since Win 10 launched, not inclusive of at least 10 clean installs) to a
<strong>BETTER</strong> Windows, then at least Microsoft try helping us to solve the problem(The 2 engineers tried their best over 2 working days but failed) or give better suggestions then contacting manufacturers etc coz it's always done much earlier until
 users have no way to turn to, that is when we come to places like this for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, Windows offered me to upgrade to Windows 10 from my Windows 7, it didn't say it WON'T work with a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip that's why I tried the upgrade, even the 2 engineers didn't know it won't work. Maybe you don't troll the web for this "fault" but
 I did since late September 2015 and to-date, neither Samsung nor Broadcom responded to this, so what gives? Who am I suppose to turn to? Came here hoping that you guys can give us the users a proper guide on what to do, not expecting standard answer/instructions
 all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we the users(Think I represent quite a number) are easy to use, trouble free computers! I have over 30 years in hardware and troubleshooting experience so I do know what I'm talking about and this now have become a real unpleasant experience again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>av</p>
<p>
</p><p>N.B. The Lenovo E440 that I'm typing the reply to you was just updated with "manually downloaded" windows updates and guess what? Start button doesn't work after that! I need to run powershell to "getapp" to get the laptop to work so stop replying in standard
 replies and come out with a genuine answer! Anyway, this is a different matter altogether.</p>

            <p><strong>FINALLY</strong> I solved this "mystery" and it's all <strong>CAUSED</strong> by a hardware problem, i.e. Broadcom Wi-Fi chip and I'm sure this might help someone out there with similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said earlier, after multiple times of <strong>UPGRADE</strong> and<strong> CLEAN INSTAL</strong><strong>L</strong> didn't work, checking the net that the Wi-Fi chip might be the culprit,&nbsp; I decided to "bisect" the Samsung RV411 laptop and swapped
 the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip(PCI-E Mini) with an older Intel chip(Full length which can hardly fit due to it's length), Win 7 was able to recognize the chip and I did the upgrade to Win 10 without any problem. It took some time but all worked. Win 10 can boot up
 and whatever data inside was intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For <strong>TESTING</strong>/<strong>DIAGNOSTING</strong> purpose, I decided to swap back to the Broadcom chip, Win 10 won't even boot up. In goes the Intel chip, it works. Tried this a few times just to confirm and the end result is Broadcom chip with Samsung
 supplied Win 7 driver <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work for Win 10. Since Samsung does not update their drivers anymore, the only way out is to swap the Wi-Fi chip to Intel(or maybe Atheros? Don't have that chip so can't really confirm!) If you think your laptop
 is valuable enough to do so. All ends well I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for giving standard reply here, please think out of the box at times. Don't follow set rules. It led us to nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much and hope my comments help others in the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Any video player seems to has a blue filter when playing saved video files, dvd&#39;s, but not you tube or live webcam. </h2>
                    
<p><span>Every time I play a video that is saved in a file on my computer, (eg from my camera, webcam, saved from an online file) and I play it in windows

I have tried re-installing the dell video driver for my computer but that did not help the situation. I am wondering if there is anything that I need to install from windows to fix this??

            Since you have already re-installed drivers, the only thing to check here is with the video adapter card. You can also try to play those videos on other computer and check.<br />

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me. In this article, we take a look at installing the latest Windows 10 build in it."><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How

            <p>Maybe its because you have a 32 bit version of Windows 7 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do, you can't install a 64 bit version in a Virtual Machine on top of a 32 bit host.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm if you have a 32 bit version of Windows 7 installed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Under System, look at the <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In will indicate if you are running a 32 or 64 bit operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution to your problem will be to get the 32 bit Windows 7 Ultimate instead.</p>

            <p><strong>Enable Virtualization</strong></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; – Restart the computer and enter BIOS setup (usually F2, F10 or F12 key on your keyboard, you need to do this before the computer loads the Windows operating system. This might vary according to brand, so consult your computers manual for instructions how
 to load the BIOS.

<p><strong>On my Computer, I had to hit the F10 key, select my language, select Security &gt; System Security and enable the following:
<br />
* Virtualization Technology (VTx) <br />
* Virtualization Technology Directed I/O (VTd)</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Search virtualization setting in BIOS and enable the setting. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Save BIOS settings (usually F10). <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Power off the computer, wait for a few seconds and start the computer. </p>

            <p>Hey there Crystal Gamurr,</p><p><br /></p><p>To elaborate fully on Smwutches and Internet Expert's replies.&nbsp;The Enforcement teams don't use the forums at all and they only communicate through a <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Case Review</a>. Not all suspensions are reviewable though, as an example, 24 Hour communications suspensions and Console Suspensions are not reviewable. However, you can find more information in these cases through the communication sent by the teams to the email address associated with your Xbox Live Gamertag. Remember that all suspensions are only enforced when a breach of the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Services Agreement</a>&nbsp;has happened.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>One of the common myths is that people who report another user for no reason will see that person suspended. This is not the case and in fact is subject to action as well for false reports which you can find more information about Enforcement Myths&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>If you believe the suspension was in error and&nbsp;if you're eligible, you can submit a case review using the steps <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>, however sometimes you're asked to complete a short questionnaire before you can submit a case review. All of the questions refer to the <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a>, which you should review prior to filing the review.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>If you fail on the questionnaire during the Case Review, don't worry as you'll be given another chance in 24 hours.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

    <title>Homegroup sharing messing up folder permissions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prashant kamani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup sharing messing up folder permissions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It looks like when sharing your libraries in your homegroup messes up the security permissions of the folders that make up those libraries. For instance, by default, the documents library is not shared. If you attempt to share it, it would go ahead and REMOVE
 all permissions for the My DOCUMENTS folder and add Read/Exec permissions for "HomeUsers". I am unsure what permissions are removed and what are left behind - I have seen different behavior for different libraries.</p>
<p>This is a royal pain. For instance, if the built-in Music app, Photos app or Videos app don't find anything in your libraries, this is a very likely reason. In this case, sharing these libraries to the homegroup removed permissions for Administrators and
 SYSTEM. When I added these permissions back manually for each folder that comprised these libraries, these apps found the media within these libraries. In my case, I have a lot of folders across different locations within these libraries (all local disks,
 not network or removable), so adding these permissions back was a laborious process.</p>
<p>Seems like a significant bug; hopefully it can be addressed soon.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can change most all Permissions at once by selecting the Higher up folder or the Root of the drive...C:\ for instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing USERS for instance, will change Permissions for everything in that folder.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions for protected Windows files that you may have to do individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to change OWNERSHIP to your USER NAME, and then ADD your USER NAME to the list...both lists actually. You will need to go to ADVANCED to change ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I have noticed, most SHARED files are allowed to EVERYONE when you use the SHARING process.</p>

            <p>Hi Nirmal/Slance310. Thanks for your response. The problem is not about how to set permissions for all folders. I am a CS engineer myself and know how to do that :) No, I can't just go up to the lowest common parent and change the permissions there for all
 folders, since I would need to enable inheritance for all subfolders to inherit from this folder's permissions, and that is not what I want to do (there would be other subfolders that are not part of any libraries, and their permissions would be modified too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is specifically about Homegroup messing up permissions of shared folders.
<strong>Instead of just ADDING RX permissions for the security group HomeUsers, it REPLACES existing permissions with RX permissions for HomeUsers.</strong> I have renamed the topic back to reflect this issue. It is very easy to
<strong>repro</strong>:</p>
<p>1. From start screen, type HomeGroup, and choose HomeGroup from search results in Settings.</p>
<p>2. If Documents is shared (by default, it isn't), unshare it.</p>
<p>3. Check permissions of your Documents folder. Note that it inherits from the parent as expected and has Full Control for Admins, System and yourself.</p>
<p>4. Go to HomeGroup again and share Documents. Wait a minute for permissions to propagate.</p>
<p>5. Check permissions of your Documents folder. <strong>Note that&nbsp;ALL existing permissions are gone, and the only permission left is RX permissions for the group HomeUsers.&nbsp;
</strong><strong>You can see pictures of Before/After/Expected permissions here: </strong>
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/TrtYKu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://sdrv.ms/TrtYKu</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically the issue is that when a folder is shared with the HomeGroup, the system needs to grant the security group HomeUsers RX permissions to the folder. If the folder is inheriting permissions from the parent, the only way these new&nbsp;permissions can be
 granted is by disabling inheritance. <strong>However, when the system disables inheritance from the parent, instead of COPYING existing permissions from the parent, it REMOVES existing permissions.</strong> This causes the permissions to be messed up, resulting
 in all sorts of issues. To name two - I can't modify anything in Documents folder, and built-in Music and Video apps not seeing any media in your library.</p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same issue on top of which once I turned on home group the apps on the Start page that don't run on desktop have stopped functioning and just hang - returning me to the Start page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't access games, Outlook, weather etc from Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I have to turn off Homegroup?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will I have to go through all my folders and deal with them one by one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was working reasonable well for weeks until Homegroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Win8 operates properly for weeks with no issues and action center empty and the only change is Homegroup doesn't this indicate Homegroup is incompatible with windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MS experts seem to throw people off to a series of standard fixes (turn off AV, reboot in safe etc)which from responses don't seem to have had much impact on the basic problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past week I was checking out some all-in touch screens to add to the home network but this issue really makes me question the utility of windows 8.&nbsp; I'm beginning to think some of the win 7 on clearance would make much sense and relegate this pc to
 something mundane.&nbsp; Lucky my laptop is XP.</p>

            I am also having this same problem. If I go in and change the permissions manually so my DLNA TV can play movies they are just reset when I restart the computer. I have tried everything systematically. This is most assuredly caused by enabling homegroup.

<h2>            OneDriveSetup.exe launching cmd.exe window to run icacls.exe - why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Microsoft Surface 5 with Windows 10.&nbsp; For months I've been experiencing an issue where a cmd.exe window will flash on my screen for less than a second, then disappear.&nbsp; It wasn't until today that I accidentally clicked in the window, and because
 I have QuickEdit enabled for cmd.exe it paused the window without closing allowing me to take a closer look.&nbsp; Firing up Process Explorer I find that the window is launched by OneDriveSetup.exe to execute icacls.exe to modify permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, this is the command that OneDriveSetup.exe is calling on my system periodically (several times a day), sanitized with XXXs for what may be personal info:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">ICACLS&nbsp; "C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive" /grant:r "*S-1-5-80-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX:(R)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SID above resolves to "NT SERVICE\wscsvc".&nbsp; The command is executing under my user account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDriveSetup.exe is being called as:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">"C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\Update\OneDriveSetup.exe" /update /restart&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no call to OneDriveSetup.exe showing anywhere with autoruns.exe.&nbsp; Does anyone have any idea why this keeps popping up?</p>

            Yes, I have OneDrive installed and running and it works as expected.&nbsp; This has been going on for... maybe a year?&nbsp; The cmd.exe box appears on my screen and then disappears in a fraction of a second.&nbsp; It's only by dumb luck that I was able to "catch" it

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Startup program issue may possibly cause this issue. Can you tell us what troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? Additionally, we want to know which Windows build and version are you using. Including a screenshot of the error would be helpful as well.</p>

<p>The troubleshooting steps I have performed appear in the original post.&nbsp; I cannot screenshot the issue as it happens too fast - the cmd.exe window appears and disappears in less than a second (again, explained in the original post), and it was only by luck
 that I caught it that once.&nbsp; When I did catch it it was simply a blank cmd.exe window with no text.&nbsp; I was able to pull the details in the OP with procexp.exe.</p>

 so I suspect it must be being called by OneDrive itself somehow.</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">I've got a Windows 10 laptop that was automatically upgraded from Windows 8.1. It was working fine for a few months. Suddenly it
 just hangs on boot. It gets to the blue screen with the spinning white dots.&nbsp;</span><br />

            <p>Hi Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>The laptop info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenovo Y510P</li><li>AV is eset-NOD32</li><li>Windows 10 build 10586.</li></ul>
<p>I tried method 2 which also disables the AV on startup, but this had no effect on the problem.</p>
<p>I still see the spinning dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode I can see all the regular users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What now?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I get the same issue, especially when using multiple search terms. MS is shooting itself on the foot by having this obvious flaw in its spanking new web browser. Very disappointed with Edge so far. Sad to say, but back to Chrome browser.<br />

<h2>            Certain windowed applications overlap the taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Best way to describe the issue is to just show you. This game (Uncharted Waters Online) is the main issue, but I've also seen it happen to another game I play in window mode too (Shellshock Live). Notice how the main window overlaps the taskbar, slightly
 obstructing the view of the pinned icons? This wouldn't be anything more than a minor annoyance, but it is somehow causing that second program to not function correctly (the small window to the right that displays a map). Normally I would just contact game
 support but this is a Windows 10 issue, not specific to any one app. (Changing ingame window resolution display sizes doesn't work, already tried that.) Does anyone know how to get, in this case, the UWO main window to stay behind the taskbar at the bottom
 like it's supposed to/always had (until recently for some reason)?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14acf58b-37d1-4290-a559-2d0c49131160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14acf58b-37d1-4290-a559-2d0c49131160" /></a></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that the windowed applications started overlapping the task bar occurred recently. May we know if you have made any significant changes to your device prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does this behavior happen when you are focused to the windowed application or is the task bar still behind the window when you click it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to check, is the resolution for your display is set in the <strong>Recommended</strong> settings? Kindly go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Display</strong>, then click
<strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>display settings</strong>. Check if the settings is set to the
<strong>Recommended </strong>settings.</p>

<p>Whether or not I made any significant changes is kind of a tough question to answer. I actually took a little break from UWO for awhile and when I started back up, I noticed the issue. I know there was a Windows update between that period of time, but that
 may or may not be the issue, of course. I hope the below screenshot will answer your two other questions.</p>

<h2>            How to Disable Autoplay in Edge</h2>
                    <p>I've gone into Edge, Settings, Advanced Settings, Use Adobe Flash Player, set to Off. Doesn't stop auto play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some have said this is the way the webpage was set to work, playing when open. I find this hard to believe any website designer would be so arrogant to think the viewer would want every video on a page to play at once. Then again.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi it is not a problem. Either they do not play until clicked on or there is an add on which stops auto play until clicked on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been all over the web, some posters said to do a registry hack, other said didn't work for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a simple way to stop what most people have said is a willfully built in MS design flaw to Edge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 with an i7, Acer desktop, 12GB of Ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Al,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge behaves like other browsers. If the web page wants to play the video automatically, it will do so. However, there are plug-ins (e.g. Click-to-Play plug-ins) and add-ons available online that can prevent auto-playing videos for different internet browsers,
 but none that is supported by Edge. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your feedback is really important to us. Please feel free to send one by clicking this

                    <p>As of today, 6-April-2017, Civilization Revolution CAN'T&nbsp;be purchased/downloaded directly to the XboxOne **unless you had already purchased/downloaded it&nbsp;for the Xbox360**. &nbsp;This is despite it being added to the&nbsp;official&nbsp;backwards compatibility list.</p><p><br /></p><p>I spent ~4 hours with Xbox support to confirm this. &nbsp;They say that if I want to play the game now on my XboxOne, I&nbsp;need to find an Xbox360 console and login with my account, purchase/download Civilization Revolution on it&nbsp;so that it's "tied" to my Microsoft account, and then I can download it&nbsp;again to my XboxOne. &nbsp; When I&nbsp;asked Xbox Support how a game could be considered&nbsp;"backwards compatible" if you still need the old console anyhow, they agreed -&nbsp;it's not! &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Xbox Support tells me the&nbsp;game was recently added to the backwards compatibility list, so "maybe" it'll get fixed&nbsp;sometime soon. &nbsp;</p>

 </p></blockquote> <p /><p>Hi Misses Quinzel, I'm currently located in Mexico, with my gamertag region-locked to the US. &nbsp;In the past, I've&nbsp;been able to purchase full games, DLC, etc -&nbsp;either from my console or from the Microsoft website - in this manner without a problem. &nbsp;In fact, while on the phone with&nbsp;Xbox Support, I&nbsp;built a new Microsoft Account and&nbsp;new Gamertag based in the US, and&nbsp;was still unable to purchase Civilization Revolution&nbsp;via the Microsoft website after trying two different credit cards that I pre-checked with my bank.&nbsp; I kept receiving the same "There was an error, please try again" message, with no error code. &nbsp;I'm forced to conclude this is indeed solely-related to this being a&nbsp;backwards-compatible game that wasn't launched properly, as Xbox Support told me. &nbsp;Assistance appreciated!</p>

                    As soon as I try to sign in, this error message pops up. This started on 8/31. I've tested my wired network, and I get a red X on the network stage of the test. I've reset router, modem etc, cleared the cache, and have restored factory defaults under "configure

<p>Appreciate if you can post up the make and model of your router and your modem as well.<br /><br />Try use a different Ethernet cable if the one you use has become defect.<br /><br />Do you have the option where you could try a wireless set up, to see if you can connect properly.<br /><br />Post back and let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi taidara! Thanks for the quick reply. I'm using a Netgear Range Max router (wpn824) and the modem is made by Arris that is from my cable company. I forgot to say in my original post that I did try a different ethernet cable that I know works, but still
 no success. Also I'm hardwired via Linksys Powerline, which works through the electrical outlets. I've used this setup for years with no problems. I would consider re-examining it, but it seems that others have also started having this exact error code all
 within the last week or so. I don't have a wireless adapter so I can't test it's wireless connection.</p>

            <p>Hey there flaflaflohi!<br /><br />Thanks for all the information you've given us! This definitely seems like a bit of an odd issue.<br /><br /><strong>Just to confirm, here's a few questions for you:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This exact setup has worked for years without issue?</li>
<li>Has anything at all changed with your setup around the time that your console became unable to connect to your network?</li>
<li>Do any other devices have issues connecting to your network at all?</li>
<li>Do you know anyone (friend/family member) with an Xbox 360 console that they could try on your network to see if the issue is specific to your console?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<p>What is the model number of your Arris modem?<br /><br />Do you have the option to connect the Xbox directly to the Arris modem?<br /><br />Have you tried to reset the Powerline adapter's and pair them back up?<br /><br />Keep us posted!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Um, yeah. Total user error on this one. Somehow the powerline's connection got severed. And I thought just unplugging and replugging it in would "reset" it. But there is a hard-to-see button on the base that you have to hit in order to pair them back up.
 Thought it was something more, since I saw others having this problem in the same couple days. Thanks for your quick replies. Great that there's a place with such effective feedback.</p>

<h2>            Email Messages Disappear in Inbox after being clicked on</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from 7, and I am having difficulty with Windows Live Mail 2012 that I didn't have previously before upgrading my OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, Windows Live Mail 2012 reports that new emails have been received, and they initially show up in the Inbox as it is supposed to do. However, if one tries to view the email and clicks on it, it suddenly disappears and cannot be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried adjusting view, though I'm unsure on how to do this. I've also contacted my ISP (this is not a Windows Live account, I believe it's an IMAP server) and they have tried to help me but have been unsuccessful. They also say that it's nothing on their
 end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and reinstalling as well, and it doesn't work. Also, the messages don't appear in the actual web client either, so I'm guessing that it has something to do with Windows Live Mail as the messages are being forwarded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, I hope this is enough information to go on.</p>

            <br />
1. I uninstalled just Windows Live Mail 2012, and I reinstalled it through the latest Microsoft Essentials package.<br />
2. The emails do not appear in the client provided by my ISP (the web client). I am referring to the email given to me by my ISP (Accesscomm here in Saskatchewan, Canada).<br />
This is just another way I can access my email, through the internet:<br />
<br />
https://mail.myaccess.ca/<br />
<br />
Emails appear in the email that is supposed to be connected to the server of my ISP, and Windows Live Mail says "X new messages" in the bottom right corner, but then when I click on the actual emails to try to see them they disappear from both the web client
 (provided by my ISP, as mentioned above) and from Windows Live Mail. The emails disappear immediately once they are clicked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. This is not a hotmail account, etc. I'm talking about the email given to me by my ISP, Access Communications.<br />
<br />
4. Since this is related to connecting my ISP email to Windows Live Mail, am I correct in assuming this is not applicable?<br />
<br />
More info: It turns out I can retain only one email at a time (only once new emails appear) IF I don't click on the email but instead click on a tab on the left. Other emails that were once there though then disappear and I can only retain the latest email
 (ie. if three new emails appear, and I click on "Inbox" on the left under the email account's header, the first or latest email is retained, whereas the other two disappear in the same way as I have described).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

                    I am running on a Windows 10 Asus laptop and a couple days ago, when i tried to open a file in my downloads folder, a message came up onto my screen saying "Provisioning Failure, Installation of a provisioning package failed. Please work with the package
 owner to diagnose the problem. Reported error code 0x80070057. It wasnt just on that one file i tried to open, when i tested my other downloads the same message popped up on my screen and those files worked before.
