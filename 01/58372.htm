<p>Champions Online seems like a much better MMO. It's free, has super heros and your 360 controller will work with it. BOI seems like a typical japanese/korean mmo with a cash shop.</p>

    <title>Will my Windows 10 upgrade give me a reusable key code&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wihber9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will my Windows 10 upgrade give me a reusable key code&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am on a Windows 7 Ultimate machine that was built back in 2009.&nbsp; Between then and now, the only hardware changes have been added ram.&nbsp; Due to the aging HDD, I expect to have to get a replacement soon, and possibly a new computer all together in the coming
 years.&nbsp; My windows 7 disc was purchased through a local university and it has a key code on it.&nbsp; If my understanding is correct, I can have this copy of 7 installed on one machine at a time using that key.&nbsp; So, I could wipe this machine or replace the HDD
 and use that same disc and key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to take my free upgrade to windows 10 right now, would I be given any sort of key that would allow me to reinstall 10 if my HDD fails/gets replaced or if I need to do a full wipe?&nbsp; It looks like 10 is going to be great, and I don't want to screw
 up my free upgrade by grabbing it in the final days of my hard drive.</p>

            <p>The free Windows 10 is registered by hardware and not by owner. So you can reinstall Win 10 as many times as you like on the same computer but you might have to reactivate if you make a major change like installing a new motherboard. Since Windows is registered
 to your hardware, it does not offer a product key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you register now and your hard drive fails, you shouldn't have to re-activate based on how Microsoft handled previous operating systems. Of course, this could change at any time. The free upgrade is available for a year so you're not pressured to make
 a decision right away.</p>

<p>When you say "but you might have to reactivate if you make a major change" do you mean I'll have to purchase another copy of Windows?&nbsp; Or do you mean just contacting Microsoft and getting it hooked up to the new hardware?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Has Apparently Locked Me Out Of My Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petelindsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Has Apparently Locked Me Out Of My Computer</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; have a new Gateway computer and wrote down the 3 passwords used in a Windows update installation. Now Microsoft has locked me out of my computer and asks that I reset the password at [https://account.live.com/password/reset]. I reset the password twice,
 but it never worked on the computer. Now I don't even get the "reset" screen. Instead it just says "You can't sign in to your PC right now". It appears that I have been hacked somehow, although I have not used the PC computer for 2 months, and the above website
 appears to be legitimate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it is Microsoft that was hacked and shut down my computer, or somehow changed MY passwords. One "help file" I found assumes you can access your computer to change passwords, but is useless if your password does not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is in my HOME, not a business, and I don't usually use it on the internet for e-mail&nbsp; or financial transactions or shopping because of the many hacking issues. I was running NAV and also let Microsoft "update my computer" when it was (often)
 required. Apparently MS downloaded some security updates or something and re-booted which requires my password. But now it seems that I may have either been hacked, or that Microsoft has somehow taken over my computer without my permission. I "think" I had
 just updated to WIndows 8 from WIndows 7, and installed some programs that I now need to use, but I can't access my OWN computer. I have heard that MS is "automatically" updating now to Windows 10 for "free", and I have received e-mails that "I can update
 now", but I can't imagine that Microsoft would do this automatically without permission and change my password in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP! </p>

<p>I have looked into it and this is what i found.</p>
<p>80153003</p>
<p>Error code 80153003 occurs when you‚Äôre using Xbox Live</p>
<p>Problem</p>
<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to download or purchase content from Xbox Live:</p>
<p>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Status Code: 80153003</p>
<p>This may mean that the download or purchase failed.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>Solution 1: Delete old data and clear your cache</p>
<p>First, try to update your Xbox Live information by clearing your cache. You may have an older version of the item you‚Äôre trying to download or purchase on your console. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
<p>Delete the Marketplace System Data. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage, and then select your primary storage device.</p>
<p>Select System Items.</p>
<p>Select Content Cache, and then select Delete.</p>
<p>Clear your console cache. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select. The cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>Restart your Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>Retry your purchase or download from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If you continue to receive this error message, there may be a problem with the offer on Xbox Live and you need to contact Xbox Support.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Delete the content and download it again</p>
<p>Delete any active downloads from the active downloads screen, delete any partially downloaded content, and then try to download the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Go to Games &amp; Apps.</p>
<p>Select Active Downloads, then select Cancel All.</p>
<p>Now that the active downloads are cancelled, delete any partially downloaded content. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller, then go to Settings.</p>
<p>Select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage, then select your storage device.</p>
<p>Press X on your controller for Deletion Suggestions.</p>
<p>Scroll through the suggestions and delete any content that has a yellow exclamation point. The exclamation point indicates content that is incomplete or corrupted.</p>
<p>Now that the partially downloaded content has been deleted, try downloading the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>Go to the Settings hub and select Account.</p>
<p>Select Download History.</p>
<p>Select the item you were having problems downloading.</p>
<p>Select Download Again.</p>
<p>If the content still doesn‚Äôt download completely, try the next solution.</p>
<p>Solution 3: Make sure you‚Äôre connected to Xbox Live</p>
<p>Test your connection to Xbox Live to make sure that a faulty connection is not the problem. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller (Xbox button in the center of your controller).</p>
<p>Go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network Settings.</p>
<p>Select your wireless network or Wired Network if you are prompted to do so.</p>
<p>Select Test Xbox Live Connection.</p>
<p>Select Yes if you are prompted to update your console software.</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre successfully connected to Xbox Live, your screen will look like this:</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre connected to Xbox Live and still can‚Äôt download the content, try the next solution.</p>
<p>Solution 4: Request a repair</p>
<p>If the previous solutions don't resolve the problem, go to the Online Service Center and click Start Request to request a repair.</p>

<p>None of the above has helped with trying to enter new card details. The error code 80153003 is still appearing after i have entered my updated details.
</p>
<p>Also the big glitch whilst trying to gain access to my account on xbox live hasn't been addressed?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Please try to add a new payment method by visiting the Microsoft Commerce site instead and see if that works. You should be able to reach that site by clicking this link
<strong><a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
The glitch you're experiencing is because you have an invalid/expired payment method on file in conjunction with automatic renewal. You should be able to resolve the problem by adding a new payment method and switching your subscription to it and then remove
 the old invalid/expired payment method. If you're having some sort of trouble doing so, you can
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a></strong> and speak with a billing agent, and they should be able to do that for you as well.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update tries to install non-existant printer driver and repeatably fails</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update wants to install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Samsung ‚Äì printers samsung universal printer driver 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update fails every time it tries to install this software. No error message is displayed as to the cause of the failure. Windows Update just wants you to Retry to download and install the update. Feels like there is a bug in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Samsung.com web site. There is NO version 3 of the Samsung universal printer driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current installed printer driver is the Samsung Universal Printer driver version 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer is a Samsung ml-2510 monochrome laser printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to stop Windows Update from trying this non-existant printer driver</p>

<h3> maciosek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete user account</h2>
                    I made a new user account and found out it had internet, and went on here to find the problem, finding that I had to make a new account. Now I can't delete the account that didn't have internet. I found that if I typed in "netplwiz" into the search box,
 I would have complete control over every account. Thing is, is that when I try to delete it, it said it could not be removed. Please help me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You won't be able to delete an account if either:</p>
<p>a) The account is currently logged on. Hit ctrl+shift+escape to open Task Manager and forcibly log them off from the Users tab first.</p>
<p>or b) if the account you are trying to remove is of a higher level than the one you are currently logged into. ie: You can't delete an administrator account from a standard user account.</p>
<p>For (a), it may help to simply reboot to offload any piece of that user account remaining in resident memory. For (b), you can always restart in Safe mode and log into the default Administrator account where you will be able to remove any user account.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Safe mode is accessed by hitting F8 at the initial system startup and selecting it from the boot menu, or by running msconfig from the start/run box and checking it on the boot tab, then restarting the system.</p>
<p>In this mode, minimal parts of the system are loaded to minimize interference. It will often allow you to perform functions that are blocked in normal mode.</p>

                    I have a computer that has the Windows Vista Home Basic sticker (key) on it. The HD has been re-partitioned and reformatted. I don't have the Windows Vista CD. Is there a way to get an .iso file so I can install a legal operating system? The owner states
 that it did not come with a Vista CD, the software was pre-installed and now has been deleted due to re-partition and reformatting. I don't think it should be necessary to purchase an OS twice!

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer has been installed with a so called OEM system. It means that your system has been pre-installed with the computer at buildtime.</p>
<p>You can get new media by looking at the following ms kb :</p>

    <title>How do I revert to default font settings in Windows 10, Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonrenner  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I revert to default font settings in Windows 10, Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I modified the font on my Windows 10, Surface Pro 4, system using the following registry file.<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</em><br />
<br />
<em>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts]</em><br />
<br />
<em>"Segoe UI (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<em>"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)"=""</em><br />
<br />
<em>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]</em><br />
<br />
<em>"Segoe UI"="Agency FB"<br />
<br />
</em>This registry file worked and made the desired changes, but now, a little while later, I'm trying to reset my font to its original state.&nbsp; I ran the registry file below, which should delete the only registry I created in the above file, and rebooted my
 system, but the font did not return to normal... I checked the registry after running my file and the registry I originally created is in fact deleted, but no change.&nbsp; Also, most annoyingly, the login pin pad now shows rectangles instead of numbers and the
 clock shows a rectangle instead of a colon.&nbsp; Any ideas what the problem could be?&nbsp; One other piece of information<br />
<br />
I saw somebody asked a similar question on these boards and the response was to use the Control Panel "<em>Restore default font settings"</em> but this did not work for him or myself.<em><br />
</em>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I solved the problem.&nbsp; I got the registry file for changing the registry from online and didn't read it very closely the first time around; I was mistaken in thinking the only thing I changed was the \FontSubstitutes registry, I also changed the \Fonts registry
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve the problem, navigate to...<br />
C:\Windows\Fonts<br />
...or wherever you store your fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find what should be the default .ttf files for the fonts that were changed.&nbsp; In this case...<br />
<em>Segoe UI</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Bold</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Bold Italic</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Italic</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Light</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Semibold</em><br />
<em>Segoe UI Symbol</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open registry by typing "Regedit" into the start menu search and pressing enter.&nbsp; Navigate to fonts registry...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>... and scroll to each of the above mentioned fonts.&nbsp; Change the data for each text type so that it is the same as the .ttf file associated with it.&nbsp; For example, Segoe UI Symbol should have its data changed to seguisym.ttf.&nbsp; Do this for each of the fonts,
 Segoe UI is the default font for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Transfer</h2>
                    So all my friends have their old worlds and some of their old skins that they previously purchased on their 360 on their xbox one. My worlds, skins, mass up packs, and textures have not transferred over and will not. I have tried everything and am beginning
 to get annoyed. I refuse to re-buy everything. Am I missing something?

<p>It‚Äôs not possible to transfer a world directly from Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition to the new version of Minecraft for Xbox One. To do this, you will need to first transfer the world to Xbox One Edition and then to the new version of Minecraft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You‚Äôll need to ensure you have the latest update for Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition by starting the game while connected to Xbox Live. The most recent update contains a feature that allows you to upload one saved world at a time to a save transfer slot. You
 can then use the Xbox 360 save download feature on Minecraft: Xbox One Edition to download that world. You‚Äôll need to make sure you download that save to your Xbox One before you can upload a new save using your Xbox 360. You can do this as often as you like,
 but you can only transfer one saved world at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You‚Äôll need to ensure you have the latest update to Minecraft by starting the game while connected to Xbox Live. Choose ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù and navigate down to the bottom, here you will find a button called ‚ÄúSync Old Worlds‚Äù. Select this button and choose the world
 you would like to transfer. You can do this as often as you like, but you can only transfer one world at a time.

    <title>Problem downloading apps from app store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem downloading apps from app store</h2>
                    <p>I never use the app store as I generally just buy the programs from the publishers website however wanted a mobi or epub reader and one that seems fairly highly rated is Freda. If you go to their website they refer you to the app store however when I click
 on GET the screen flashes and it simply comes back to the same page in the app store but nothing happens as far as downloading or installing the app. I tried in numerous times with the same result. I tried a couple of other apps as well to see if it was just
 that app but it isn't, it does the same for the other few apps I tried as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone has a better reader they can suggest I would appreciate it and if not then a fix so I can download Freda from the app store would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack SP1 on my computer.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm own a Toshiba Satellite laptop and need to install .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack SP1 in order to use a program on my computer for picture editing. I can download it perfectly fine but every time I try to install it, I get an error stating that something
 cause the setup to fail and it uninstalls everything.</p>
<p>This is all Greek to me, but hopefully it makes some sense to you. Here is the error log:</p>

<p>I'm not completely computer illiterate, but I'm not advanced either. I really appreciate any help, but if you know how to fix this
<strong><em>please</em> give me the step-by-step "For Dummies" version </strong>so to speak. I would be very grateful for any help! Thank you!!!</p>

<p>[Sorry, forum Alerts haven't been working.]</p>
<p>First run the Fix It in this KB article &amp; see if the update will install after doing so:</p>
<p>How to fix MSI software update registration corruption issues<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187</a></p>
<p>If no joy, see...</p>
<p>When installing updates using Windows update or Microsoft Update you may receive Error 0x643 or 0x80070643 (ignore the error, if necessary)&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a></p>
<p>Then proceed per the following:</p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>Step #1 =&gt; Before doing anything else, write down what .NET Framework versions are currently installed:</p>
<p>How to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed and whether service packs have been applied<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/kb00318785.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/kb00318785.aspx</a></p>
<p>Step #2 =&gt; Now see Resolution Method 2 in this related KB article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a></p>
<p>After running the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool (<em>not</em> the Windows Installer Cleanup utility), reinstall all .NET Framework versions (but only the ones you wrote down in #1 above) manually using the download links on the page then run Windows Update
 manually to install security updates for same.</p>
<p>NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1) using the tool, reinstalling .NET Framework 3.5 will also install .Net Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1), reinstall your .NET Framework versions in the following order:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. .Net Framework 3.5, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. .Net Framework 1.1, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1</strong></p>

    <title>Transferring System Image Backup to a hybrid SSD&#47;HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roy_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring System Image Backup to a hybrid SSD&#47;HDD</h2>
                    <p>Assuming one has a system image of the boot drive, created using the Win 7 native tool, what happens if I install a hybrid SSD/HDD and install the image on it? Will this process negate the advantage of having the SSD?</p>
<p>More generally, is installing the system image on a newly installed (non-SSD) standard 7200 rpm HDD a straightforward procedure, assuming that the new drive has a larger capacity than the previous boot drive? Or are we talking about potentially awful fiddling
 about with boot sectors etc?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Based on the query, I would like to provide you with the information that yes you can transfer from HDD to SSD. You need to follow some simple instructions which are mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Boot your computer on your current disk
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Use Windows disk management to verify that the active partition is on the system disk (right click on the computer icon on your desktop, choose manage, storage, and disk management).
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the menu of the Windows disk management, choose view, top, list disks. Note whether your current disk is an MBR or a GPT disk.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Print a screen shot of the disk management console for future reference
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Uninstall any program you don't want on the SSD (e.g. games). You need to make sure that the spaced used on the partitions you are going to backup will be of a much lower total size than the available space
 on your SSD minus 10% (see below about the 10%) </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do a full backup of your current disk. Include all partitions, even the hidden ones (no need to use the sector by sector setting). At restore time, we can leave some user-created content partitions out to fit
 the SSD if required. If space is a concern, you can exclude some file types (e.g. videos, pictures, movies, etc.).
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Put your SSD at the same spot at your current disk. Remove your current disk from the computer for the time being.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Boot your computer on the Acronis recovery CD
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Acronis tools, choose add new disk. Initialize your disk as GPT if your OLD disk was GPT, as MBR if it was MBR.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restore each partition at a time in the same order they were laid out (use your screen shot). This will allow to control resizing and offset to align the disk
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Leave a 1MB space before the first partition (maybe system reserved?)
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mark the correct partition active (maybe system reserved?). If your disk was GPT, this doesn't apply.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Leave the drive letter change option alone
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do not resize any partition except the C:\system partition or any partition you created and want on the SSD
</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Make sure that each partition has a size that is a whole number of MB (doesn't matter for the last partition)
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ideally for the last partition, you could leave about 10% of your SSD unallocated. This is optional to maintain SSD performance. Hence the 10% mentioned above. Note that most users just use all the SSD space
 they can. No big deal if you do the same. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No need to reboot in between partition restores

            <p>What can I say? One one hand thank you for posting the details above (assuming you didn't simply copy and paste it - which I'm pretty sure you did): on the other, they refer to a different question to that which I asked.</p>
<p>1) I mentioned <strong><em>HYBRID </em>SSD/HDD</strong>: you simply ignored this.</p>
<p>2) I stated<strong> Win 7 derived</strong> <strong>system image</strong>: your reply blithely mentions Acronis. "<span><em>Boot your computer on the Acronis recovery CD</em>".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't really be surprised about this. It happens all the time. But it's depressing.</p>
<p>A word of advice: <strong>before answering a question it usually pays to first READ the question.</strong></p>
<p>In this case I don't believe you did. But this is an internet forum...</p>

<p>For some unclear reasons, the accounts &nbsp;of my mum and I got mixed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her address mum@herprovider was the recovery email address for my account, attached to the kid@myprovider address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She had some connection issues, and our accounts got mixed up. When she tries to log in to skype with her address, she ends up in my profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her address mum@herprovider is not my recovery address anymore, there are no visible connection between our accounts/addresses, but the problem remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you help us please?</p>

</p><p><span><span>To isolate the case, kindly sign in to Skype using your mom‚Äôs email address and other device and check if you will get the same issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>But just a heads up, based on your post, it seems that your account was already merged on your mom‚Äôs email address.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no option to unlink/merge the said accounts, it will now become a single sign in for Skype and Microsoft. For more information you can check this link:

<p>Thanks for your quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it's not related to q particular device, her password is not recognised anymore, and the password recovery tool sends code to my own email address, so she can't change it no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the thing is, what will happen to my mum's profile? What if someone looks her up and, say, want to send her a message? Is it possible to block/remove her account since she can't connect anymore?</p>

<h3> labo104  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Tries to log into non-existent user during startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. I have a slight nuisance problem: I would like for the computer to start up, with no password or log in screen required. I completely understand going into netplwiz and unchecking the box "users must enter a password on startup." I have also looked
 at every possible thread I could find to allow this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue: On Windows start up, it tries to log into a user named "Aaron." It will then give an "incorrect password error." I then have to select "SEV" and type in the password to log in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to delete this user named "Aaron" but I can find no way to do so. The only thing I can think of is that "SEV" has "Aaron" as part of the Microsoft family. In the users menu, "Aaron" is disabled from logging in (enabling Aaron to log in doesnt
 help - it just adds a third user to the sign-in list). <strong>The only user I would like there to be on the computer is "SEV," and I would like it to log in without prompting for a password.</strong></p>
<p>Relevant screenshots attached.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77dfbbae-f26a-4590-b398-cdd50aef561b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77dfbbae-f26a-4590-b398-cdd50aef561b" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dea096d0-14ab-4490-a318-90dec6ae3ff2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dea096d0-14ab-4490-a318-90dec6ae3ff2" /></a></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open action center or settings in Windows 10. Everything else works.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am experiencing some weird, persistent issues. It seems I am unable to open the settings from Start&gt;Settings, or right-click-on-task-bar or Win+I. I can press the icons, but nothing happens - at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue occurs with the action center. It says "4 new events", but I can't left click or right click open it. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another weird issue is that my sound disappears after 20-40 minutes. This happens when watching YouTube or Netflix. Audio fault search does not return any issues. When I try to listen to local music via Foobar, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Unrecoverable playback error: Unknown error code (0x8889000A)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this appeared suddenly a couple of weeks ago, and I see no reason for it. Restarts don't help. Driver reinstalls seem not to matter. Defender and Malwarebytes Antimalware find nothing in repeated, full scans. I can open the control panel, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Dell XPS M1530, a pretty old machine, but it kept breaking for years and is on its fourth HDD, second motherboard, extended RAM etc. Lots of new stuff that used to work well until recently. No changes, Windows 10 is fully updated on a "pro" license
 originally purchased when Windows 8 was new. I have harsh privacy settings, but all is stock and non-modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>can't open settings</li><li>can't open action center</li><li>sound disappears but only after a while of use</li><li>everything updated and check with regular assistance software</li></ul>
<p>

            I may have made a mistake of running Tech Utilities and now have the same issue. &nbsp;It happened 4 days ago too, but uninstalled and reinstalled the cumulative windows &nbsp;update and that fixed the issue. &nbsp;Today, just ran Tech Utilities and have the same issue.

            <p>What kind of tech utilities? Is there a Windows 10 app named that way? Didn't find it via Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have probably had a look at most of the available settings in the OS, but I am not aware of a specific cause for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is weird though is that a Windows update ran yesterday evening and fixed all these issues. Right after I finally tried to get an answer to what's happening, haha...</p>

                    I just received a call from my dad and he decided to install Fedora on his pc with windows. Instead of reading how to do it correctly....his compiter will not boot into windows. When it comes up to the boot screen you can chose windows but it wont boot.
 Fedora works just fine. Is there a fix for this because he would like to save his data.&nbsp;

<p>Now that's really easy: Connect a USB disk to the PC, then copy his data to this disk while under Fedora.</p>

            While i can do that, but he has no sense of how to keep files organized so that would be a choir. I was hoping for a way to get windows running again. I was even wondering if i could use windows to go to get into it and make it easier for me.....my laptop
 is identical to his so it shouldnt be hard to do windows to go. Ive never done it so i really dont know.

<p>Windows to go is only available on Enterprise builds which is a version specific to corporate licenses</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to boot from Windows 10 media and repair the boot code but unlikely. Linux install can make the disk unusable for Windows unless fully cleaned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the install it would have required configuring the GRUB boot loader to protect the Windows installation and include it into the boot menu. I don't know if this can be done after the install (this is a Windows forum after all) so you would need to
 look at Linux forums for how to configure GRUB.</p>

            I totaly agree with you about storing file on two seperate places i purposely set up my computer so that all of my personal and important files are on a hard drive that does nothing but store files and its mirrored and backed up to an external hard drive.
 Too many people take that stuff for granted.&nbsp;

<p>Your dad can download, create a bootable copy, perform a custom install over the Windows 10 partition or perform a startup repair. The custom install will archive the existing install then you can recover files from Windows.old.</p>

<p>Is there a fix for this because <strong>he would like to save his data</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While i can do that, but he has no sense of how to keep files organized so that would be a choir. I was hoping for a way to get windows running again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your initial question was actually how to save the data!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping his files organized would be no chore at all if he copies the whole folder structure to the external disk while under Fedora.</p>

            Well im having good luck fixing the dual boot problem. No matter what i tried windows 10 would throw an error. I downloaded win 10 enterprise and installed it on the partitions that fedora was on. This made it way easier to find the files i needed to save
 and i was able to recover office product key. When i get done transferring files i will be doing a fresh install.&nbsp;

<p>Could be from players inviting your gamertag specifically. You can just reject the game and/or block the player if you're not wanting to play AJ anymore. Some people search the forums or top 50 for people to invite.

<p>It's extremely annoying getting random requests as most of them are using solvers to get the achievements. One I've just recently denied started with a six letter word beginning with J that is not in common usage and completely ignored placement.</p>
<p>Is there any way of turning off invites? If not it might be worth coding it into the next update.</p>

<p>It was in the last update (1.3). Go to AlphaJax - Help &amp; Options. You can turn off Random game invites and Skill match game invites.</p>
