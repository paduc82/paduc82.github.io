<br />
<br />You can also check the HP Support Downloads webpage for your exact model or serial number (from sticker on PC) to manually check for newer drivers including this one.  
<br />
<br />I do trust newer driver Updates from HP or Windows Update to help keep your system running well as mistakes are one in a million or less.

            Was it an odd looking screen after the computer was wakened from sleep mode? 
<br />
<br />I had a similar occurrence this morning on a computer that has never had Windows 8 on it. I suspect malware. I ignored it, it seems to have gone away. I'm hoping the Defender will identify it and delete it.

 unfortunately it will not let me download since I need to have the most up to date software. I have not made any changes and just want to get this resolved...any advice would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!

    <title>Loud fans - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt on surface pro 3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loud fans</h2>
                    Sometimes the fans start running really loud, definitely not stealthy, and the surface gets pretty hot. Most recently it happened when I was using 2 modern windows apps IE and Evernote side by side.&nbsp; This seems weird since it's not like I am running photoshop
 or something intense in the desktop mode. I noticed it really eat my battery also. I tried restarting, and then the issue arose again. Anyone else experiencing this also?

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the loud fans and overheating of the device on the Surface Community. I appreciate it! That sure is concerning that your Surface Pro 3 is behaving that way. I'll try my best to help get these issues resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have all Windows updates? There are multiple updates you will need to install for the Surface Pro 3 in order for it to work properly.<br />
You mention that you were using 3 apps side by side at the same time when this issue occurred. Have you tried using other apps and see if you get the same results?<br />
What is your battery mode set as? (Control Panel &gt; Power Options) Do you hear the fan still running loudly and feel the device getting hot even if you change the power/battery plan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know!</p>

            Despite what MS claims the fans do get loud when the system is tasked. Odds are one of your apps was eating the CPU. Even metro apps eat resources. All of the internal goodies are in the upper right if the tablet and that's where the heat is generated.
 Even with metro IE, certain websites will cause warmth such as ESPN, but they have sooo much crud&nbsp;on that site. Heck, I've had the USB port create significant heat at times.

            <p>Go back and watch the release event. Panay says you won't see, hear or feel the fan. Of course that's a bold claim assuming one is using it just as a tablet.&nbsp; While I can't see the fan, I can definitely feel and hear it when the system is tasked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or go read any of the dozens of reviews. Many bring the topic up.</p>

            <p>I have an I7 512gb with a lot number/date of 1428. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;a problem with fan noise when using Skype. &nbsp;As soon as the fan starts spinning no one on the call can hear me. &nbsp;They describe the noise they hear as loud static. &nbsp;I have tried with the cover attached,
 cover completely off, and in the new dock. &nbsp;All have the same problem although it seems a bit worse when in the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Skype quite a bit and this situation is completely unacceptable. &nbsp;I don't know if I have a defective unit or it is a design flaw. &nbsp;I thought I would give a Microsoft device a try but unless I get a definitive answer soon I will return the Surface and
 go back to Apple products.</p>

            <p>I have the the same issue on the Metro Skype app, the desktop Skype program, and Google Hangouts (in Chrome and IE). &nbsp;It usually takes a minute or two before the fan starts spinning loudly if the video conferencing software is the only program running. &nbsp;If
 I try running several programs with the video conf software then the fan starts almost immediately. &nbsp;In addition 30 minutes on Skype used about 50% of the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fan also runs very loudly when playing any video intensive game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a second SP3 I7 512gb this week from the local Microsoft store to see if had the same problem and it does. &nbsp;It is going back. &nbsp;The first one went with my son to college but I'm guessing it won't be usable for him with the heat problems and loud fan
 noise. &nbsp;I will probably have to send that one back as well and get him a MacBook. &nbsp;It is very unfortunate since he really wanted a Windows laptop/tablet.</p>

            <p>I am on my 3rd I7 512GB, and they all have this issue.&nbsp; It is random but worse and more constant on the docking station.&nbsp; Often times it gets very hot and loud&nbsp;after just a short time of normal use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's amazing is that everyone at the support number and the store to whom I have talked about this issue acts&nbsp;surprised and told me&nbsp;they have never heard/seen this issue elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent a lot of time dealing with issues with Surface Pro 3, and I hope MSFT can address this issue and others as I still like the device over Mac.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having some difficulty installing Direct X on my computer. I've updated my display/graphic drivers with no luck. The reason I am attempting to reinstall install Direct X is because I continue to get an error saying d3dx9_33.dll in my System32 folder
 contains an error (error status 0xc000012F). I'm running a 64 bit machine. The directx&nbsp;install will not complete.</p>

<h2>            Delete and Cut missing from File Explorer Context Menu</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My first post here. I searched here but could not find an answer, maybe someone can shed some light on this. I am trying to help an elderly
 friend who has run into a problem that neither of us can solve. I consider myself pretty savvy on computers, but this one has me stumped.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">He called and said he could no longer delete unwanted files. I stepped though the normal steps of finding the file, right clicking on it, move
 down context menu, and then select Delete. However, here lies the problem. He has no Delete to select, nor does he have a Cut to select. I even had him try to select the file and use the "Red X" at the top menu bar, however, when he selects a file, the top
 menu bar switches from the Home to the File tab. When he selects the Home tab, the files he selected gets de-selected.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope I made this clearer than mud...sure could use some options to try.</span><br />

<h2>            System Event Notification Service - Failed to connect to a Windows Service. Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service</h2>
                    I am unable to connect to my wireless network using my Sony laptop, (Vista home premium). This follows an infection in my desktop PC by a trojan which did not prevent but slowed down internet browsing. I have reinstalled windows vista on the pc and it
 is working ok nwo bur my laptop still gives me this message. "Failed to connect to a Windows Service. Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents limited users from logging on to the system. As an administrative
 user, you can review the System Event Log for details about why the service didn't respond." I am the administrator on my pc and laptop. I have tried changing user to no avail. I am using Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1. Intel Core 2Duo T7250 2GHz. 2GB RAM.
 32 bit. Sony Vaio FZ31M. If you can give me instruction on how to rectify the problem it would be appreciated. Thank you, Tony

<h2>            WINDOWS VISTA TASKBAR</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Everyone<br />
I'm new to this so I hope I'm doing this correctly!<br />
I purchased a computer and windows vista at first the task bar at the bottom showed a thumbnail of any documents which I was working on which I thought was fantastic!<br />
This has now decided not to work. I have consulted my 'Windows Vista for Dummies' and got as far as right clicking the task bar then selecting properties then the Taskbar tab - this shows the taskbar appearance there is no&nbsp;option to check the box next to 'Show
 window previews (thumbnails) it is grey in color and can not be checked. I then went back and looked further in the book and noticed that there is a side note that reads&nbsp;(this option remains unavailable unless your PC packs powerful grafics) I am confused
 as it did work before. Where have I gone wrong. Please can you help? Kind&nbsp;regards Elaine&nbsp;</p>

            Right, there is your problem: Windows Aero is not enabled.
<div><br />
<div>To enable windows Aero:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go to Start</div>
<div>Go to Control Pannel</div>
<div>Go to Appearance and Personalisation or Personalise in the classic view.</div>
<div>Click on Personalsation</div>
<div>Click on Window Color and Appearance</div>
<div>Click on Classic appearance properties.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the new window called Appearance Settings:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Choose the color scheme Windows Aero</div>
<div>Click on Apply</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once it is enabled, you should get your thumbnails back! Let me know how it goes.</div>

<h2>            Star Wars Republic Commando, Game automatically crashes after selecting &#34;New Game&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought this game yesterday and for some reason it isn't working for my laptop. After I start the game, and I make my profile, when I hit "New Game" it goes to the loading screen, then the screen blacks out to the desktop with the application already
 shut down. Can anyone help me to fix this problem?</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit (6.1, Build 7600)</p>
<p>RAM: 8192 MB RAM</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i7 Q760</p>
<p>DirectX Version: DirectX 11, but when I was installing the game, it told me I had an older version of DirectX so I installed it hoping I could play with that installed.</p>
<p>Video Card: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5730</p>

 BT Infinity and stream videos and TV without any issues, so am pretty sure it is not down to my internet connection. Any idas?</p>

</p><p>Make sure that choose the device you would like to use as the prioritized device on your Skype. Skype will normally pick the OS prioritized device as the default speaker, but you can manually change this on Skype. You can try to use eco /sound test service
 to make a test call to check I the are set up or working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this FAQ for more details&nbsp;about call quality: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12097</a></p>

            <p>The driver has to come from microsoft as it has customizations, obtaining it from intel will download a generic version. Not a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that manually forcing the installation of the plain Intel drivers from the Intel website works and I used that as a workaround for some time. But, then I tried to install the Anniversary Update and it failed, see this thread:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfbook-surfupdate/anniversary-update-fails-restoring-your-previous/55aaef02-84ee-4379-9bdc-312c491af7a9">

<p>
</p><p>I have now correlated the failed Anniversary Update to this issue Error 0x800705b3 in Windows Update for the graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your SB is undocked, not using any external screen.</li><li>Uninstall the Intel Display Adapter completely, select "remove drivers"</li><li>Your SB will now be using the Nvidia GPU or a generic driver (NOTE! I have an SB with an additional GPU. Not sure what happens if you do this on a device that does not have 2 GPU. I think it will switch to a generic driver and still work, i.e. you will
 see your screen....but I'm not certain. Try this at your own risk.)</li><li>Open command prompt in admin mode</li><li>do <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>pnputil -e</strong></span> to get a list of all installed drivers</li><li>look for "Intel Display Adapter" drivers and note the "oem###.inf" names of all of those</li><li>do <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>pnputil -f -d oem###.inf</strong></span> for each of those "oem###.inf" names to force removal of all of the drivers, including old ones,&nbsp;for the Intel Display Adapters from the windows/system32/driverstore
 (yes, all of them)</li><li>reboot</li><li>now, do Windows Update as usual and enjoy it finding and properly installing the latest MS approved Intel Drivers for your graphics card</li><li>Now, the update to Anniversary Update will also be successful.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at loss why this is necessary, but I'm just happy my SB now works OK and all drivers are updating as expected. Hope it works for you too.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too was able to fix the problem, not being able to install the Anniversary Update was my trigger to sort it out as well!</p>
<p>Slightly different approach.</p>
<p>I removed the display driver using the Device Manager - a bit worrying as I didn't know what would happen. As with Helheimr my SP4 switched to a generic driver.</p>
<p>I used the intel driver update utility&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html</p>
<p>It ran, identified the driver and downloaded the correct driver.</p>
<p>I had to run it twice, it failed the first time. Second time it worked fine.</p>
<p>However, the Anniversary Update would fail, no reason given, it would just re-load the previous installation. I tried the same update on my older Pro2 and a S3 and had the same issue, so it was not connected to the display driver.</p>
<p>I created an ISO copy onto a USB, worked on all 3 surfaces.&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>Everything fine now</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Screen Flickering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frustratedpoodle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screen Flickering</h2>
                    Hey guys, I know this isn't a new issue, but has anyone figured out a solution to the screen flickering with the Surface pro 4? It has served me perfectly for 3 years until the past 2 weeks. Initially I thought it was associated with overheating, but I've
 found that the screen flickers even when cool. It usually starts near the end of the day and it seems to be workload dependent. I don't know what I can do to resolve this issue, and the Microsoft online virtual assistant sucks ass. If there is no solution,
 what can I do without a warranty? Thank you in advance!&nbsp;

            There are several flavors of screen flickering/shaking being reported. Customers who exchange their SP4's report that the exchanged refurbs start flickering as well. There is one flavor that MAY have a work around but it may not work for your case.
<br />   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/part-of-top-of-display-is-echod-onto-the-bottom-of/edc25f08-737a-4e8f-955f-8ffe106ffc26?messageId=2215bcf6-a032-4806-9bfa-adebae732df3">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/for...</a> - take a look at Hal's fix and see if this works for you. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft really doesn't have a solution for this (I don't work for Microsoft) - but if the fix to show seconds works, recommend you don't even consider an exchange (which is what Microsoft recommends to folks that call support) unless the issue returns. If you don't have Microsoft Complete, your one year warranty is most likely up and it will cost you $$ to exchange.
<br />
<br />There have been over 1000 people complaining about flickering issues. The trade press has picked it up again last month. If you do a search, you will see what the press is saying. Here is the search to run: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=surface+pro+4+flickering&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US%3AIE-Address&amp;biw=1329&amp;bih=655&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A12%2F1%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F6%2F2018&amp;tbm=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?q=surface+pro+4+f...</a>   
<br />
<br />Microsoft outsourced agents are telling customers to reimage and jump through all kinds of hoops. No one has reported that reimaging resolves the issue. If you are in the US, you can try going to a physical retail Microsoft Store and asking to see the manager to see if they will swap you out, even out of warranty at no charge, or better, swap you for a newer Surface Pro 2017 (for an upcharge).
<br />
<br />I know this isn't good news. I've been trying to get Microsoft to say more than "we are aware of the issue" for over 6 months without success. It's obviously an issue that Microsoft doesn't want to really talk about (I don't work for Microsoft). 
<br />
<br />PLEASE don't shoot the messenger. If this explains the issue, please DO mark as Answer.

    <title>REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTION WINDOW TINY&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTION WINDOW TINY&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Musical9 asked this question last year: </p>
<p>On my remote machine, the desktop icons, icon titles, taskbar and jump lists are puny, very difficult to read the small font size.</p>
<p>I've tried all of the various display/sizing options in my&nbsp;Surface's&nbsp;control panel, and also the display setting tab&nbsp;in Remote Desktop Connection,&nbsp;and have not found any comnbination that works well on the remote and Surface Pro 3. (Also, the sizing options
 are not so convenient anyway since a sign out is generally needed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything on that people recommended, but I can't figure out where the "server properties" window is. Anyone? Also, the machine I'm trying to access remotely is running Windows 7 (it's a virtual computing lab at my school). I am running Windows 8.
 No matter what I do, the display box for the remote machine I'm looking at is tiny, about 1/4 of the SP3 screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>What do you mean by scrambled keyboard? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean it is broken? If so, try to borrow a USB keyboard from a friend to see if it will work or if there is some other issue with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do you mean the keys you press are not what they should be? If so, than what is the model of the laptop? Will see if can find a manual for it to see what function key it has.

            <p>Thank you for replying, yes the whole keyboard does not correspond to any keys that they are</p>
<p>suppose to.</p>
<p>It is a laptop IBM a very good one, XP Pavilion which I would like to update to W7 or 8</p>
<p>Any idea what to do, IBM does not have technical support for previous model, so Microsoft Community</p>
<p>is my last hope.</p>
<p>Thank you again&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Try a USB keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works, than your keyboard might have a loose wire or needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you good with taking apart and put things back together? If yes, than check a video for your specific model of XP Pavilion and determine if it is easy to get to the wire to see if it is loose. If it is not loose, than you need to buy another keyboard
 and replace unless you can live with a USB keyboard.</p>

<h2>            uninstalling Webroot</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 8.1. and I'm having a real problem uninstalling Webroot. When I go to the control panel and hit uninstall Webroot isn't listed. It was installed by the people I bought the computer from. I've tried appwiz.cpl but guess I'm not smart enough
 to get that to work for me. I'd certainly appreciate a good direction on this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Ken</p>

<p>Hola Kakaroto :P</p>
<p>¿Has intentado algunas cosas en especial? Si no lo has hecho intenta eliminar la caché de la consola y reiniciarla desconectando todo e inclusive expulsa el disco duro, cuando la hayas desconectado deja reposarla durante 1 minuto y después procedes a conectar
 todo.</p>
<p>Para ver como se elimina la caché ve a este enlace; <a href="https://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-360/console/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>Para ver como se expulsa/remueve el disco duro ve a;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a></p>
<p>Si los pasos no te ayudan intenta moverla de lugar a uno más ventilado.</p>
<p>Saludos!</p>

    <title>Why does my left click stop working sometimes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my left click stop working sometimes&#63;</h2>
                    I have a HP ProBook 430 G2 and sometimes when I'm browsing through the internet the left click stops working for a minute but the right click works just fine. It usually happens when move the mouse to the scrolling bar and start scrolling and when I try
 to right click to stop the bar from following my mouse it won't let me and if I move the mouse up and down the scrolling bar follows it until I right click to stop it. It usually only happens when I am scrolling and I either I have to put the laptop to sleep
 or keep pressing the right button until it finally works. It is very annoying to deal with but I don't know why it happens sometimes.
