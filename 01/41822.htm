<h2>            where can i find mspaint if i accidentally uninstalled it&#63;</h2>
                    I defragmented my computer and cleaned the hard drive. I accidentally uninstalled it and was wondering if there is a free download to get it back.

            Maybe you only deleted the shortcut to Paint.<br />
<br />
Try going to...Start / Run...and type or copy/paste...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mspaint.exe<br />
Then press...Enter. <br />
<br />
If Paint does not launch...see the following article:<br />

<blockquote>I have Windows XP SP2 installed on my computer. I want to buy Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit to install it on the same computer.
<p>First question: Can I do it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your computer can run 64bit - yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom Clean Install Steps </strong><br />
<br />
Times to use: <br />
<strong>Moving from XP to Windows 7,</strong> or other unsupported in place upgrade paths (ex: Vista Home to 7 Pro)
<br />
<strong>Moving from a 32 bit Windows system to a 64 bit system,</strong> or changing languages
<br />
Don't want to do an in place upgrade, or you want a fresh/clean install <br />
<br />
You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an external storage before doing so. You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows
 7. Here are the steps: <br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external storage device. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool you can use to copy your files (but
 not programs) from your PC, and then transfer them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy the files you want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. Depending on what you have installed you might
 be able to download some programs from the Internet. <br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."
<strong>Note: 32 to 64 bit requires you to restart and boot from the DVD. </strong>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then you're done - enjoy Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Second one: It's better to use XP Virtual Mode?</blockquote>
<p>You'll need to be more specific - what are you asking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate you can download and install Windows XP Mode. XP Mode is a Virtual installation of XP that runs at 32 bit inside Windows 7. It's similar to a normal installation of XP with a few exceptions: only uses a single
 CPU core, only has access to USB and serial ports, DVD access is read only, limited to 16-bit graphics (3D games don't play well).
<br />
<br />
<br />
XP Mode main page: <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
If your computer does not support virtualization there is an update that will allow XP Mode to run without virtualization. You can check if your PC hardware doesn't support virtualization and needs the update by downloading and running this tool:
<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=163321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=163321</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need to enable hardware virtualization on your computer: <br />
1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS settings. <br />
2. Look for the virtualization setting in BIOS and enable it. <br />
3. Save the BIOS settings and then restart your computer. <br />
<br />

    <title>How do I fix the &#39;runaway cursor&#39; syndrome, I have been - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gypsydn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix the &#39;runaway cursor&#39; syndrome, I have been reporting for over a year and a half&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This has got to be the most annoying bug of any I have ever experienced. The cursor just takes off anytime, for no apparent reason or cause, opening windows and apps as it goes by any icon. I get no replies on the Feedback Hub, and so far none on the forums
 except to direct me to previous fixes that may have worked on WinXP, Vista, WIn7, 8, 8.1, and maybe 10. As this little oddity happens whether or not I am using the computer, or am even sitting in front of it, I do not see how it can be related to the mouse
 or even the touch screen, as it happens without any manual operation of any input device. I cannot isolate a trigger, as it is so random, the only thing I have found that is consistent, is it heads right for the Start button, and if I do not touch the mouse
 or the screen, or in any other way move the cursor manually, it just remains on the start button, no more problem (I just cannot use the computer). Oddly, it is so random that it may not start for an hour, and then continue for 15 minutes and disappear again
 for a half hour or so, before going into its strobing of windows all over my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My System:</p>
<p>HP TouchSmart 610-1050f, All-in-one Desktop PC</p>
<p>OS: Win 10 Pro, WIP* version 1607, build 14965 &nbsp;*(Windows Insider Preview)</p>
<p>Storage: 3TB on 7 drives (C Drive has .5TB Free)</p>
<p>Memory: 16GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixes attempted to date, gleaned from general knowledge, wikis, Windows forum sites, MS and 3rd Party, The MS Answers and Windows Insider forums, YouTube, on board troubleshooters, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disabled Cortana in registry (as 'she' had control over most devices on the machine)- No help</p>
<p>2. Control Panel- Mouse and Keyboard- Disabled all 'extra' cursor operations, that in any way operated the cursor- No Help</p>
<p>3. Disabled the Touch screen in Device Mgr (but it still works??) No Help</p>
<p>4. Ran Troubleshooters for anything remotely involved with input, including all "Hardware and Devices"</p>
<p>5. Did 'Clean boot' config, with only MS services running- No Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of suggestions, hoping I would find more recent ones where someone with &nbsp;similar config, has/had a similar issue, and FIXED it! Is that YOU? Chime in please!!</p>

            Hi Christine,
<br />
<br />You are probably better to use the Skype Classic application, if there is a conflict with your Webcam . . .
<br />
<br />Skype classic is the bottom option on this page:

    <title>Lost my Minecraft save. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roflitswill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost my Minecraft save.</h2>
                    
<p>That is to say, after the update the save file is of a completely different world and I have no idea why. At first the world wouldn't load at all, so I thought to myself that the update probably was messed up in some way so I simply deleted it and redownloaded
 it. That fixed the part where it wouldn't load, <strong>but now it's an entirely different seed.</strong></p>
<p>And I know what you're probably thinking "deleting and redownloading the save probably deleted it", and normally I'd agree with you.</p>
<p>Except all of my other worlds are fine and they were all made within the same week of my main seed.</p>
<p>So the TU completely ruined a save of mine and if there's any way to get it back at all, I'm open to any suggestions.</p>

<p>I have had this problem before with another game. I called Xbox support and if you have a live account they can retrieve it for you. I on the other hand when I had a similar problem I wasn't a live member at the time so I couldn't get it back.

<p>When updates with new biomes or new things that generate in the world are added, there are normally some problems with the seeds, because they change. They added swamp and jungle biomes in previous updates, so sometimes you have problems with swampy, snowy
 biomes and jungle biomes to spawn where they shouldn't, if this happend to you there is probably no way of getting the old map back, because the seed is different than it was...</p>

<h2>            Pointer &#40;Mouse&#41; Profiles</h2>
                    <p>I have a significant tremor in my hands.&nbsp; I can use a mouse pretty well, but touchpads and some trackballs can be hard to use.&nbsp; At work I have been assigned a laptop.&nbsp; When I am away from my desk's docking station, I have to dial down the pointer travel
 speed to make the touchpad useable.&nbsp; Then when I get back to the mouse at my desk, I have to dial the pointer speed up again.&nbsp; I can't carry a mouse with me around the building because space for a mouse can be limited at meetings and when sitting with colleagues
 at their desks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I configure a "profile" for each pointer device on Windows 10?&nbsp; Ideally, I'd like Windows to ID the device moving to pointer, and automatically apply the correct profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If pointer profiles are not an existing Windows 10 feature, how can I make a feature request for pointer profiles as an adaptive technology?</p>

            Hi Trent, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I don't believe there is an option to configure your trackpad sensitivity separately to your mouse, unless your laptop manufacturer provides tools to accomplish this.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to make a feature request directly to Microsoft, you can press the keyboard shortcut Windows Kkey+F to open Feedback Hub, where you can send your feedback to Microsoft.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

            <p><strong>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to install a driver for it - probably from Dell.</p>
<p>Problem is apparently you and nobody else will know what that device is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to device manager and look for the item with a yellow or red traffic sign.&nbsp; You already know that I assume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expand it out and double click it, or right click and select properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Go to the tab that says Details and look in the drop down box for the&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardware ID and post it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or search the web and you will see what it is.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While your in that..&nbsp; look and see if you can see a manufacture name or description of something that makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably need to visit Dell support pages for the driver download on that hardware item.</p>

<p>OS=Vista, VS2005</p>
<p>Last week when the Windows Vista update sat forever updating 3 of 12.&nbsp; I seached for a solution to that problem and was led to an MS page that had a button to click that would fix the problem.&nbsp; Well it did fix that problem,&nbsp; but than I started to get the&nbsp;"The
 Application Data Folder for Visual Studio could not be created" &nbsp;notice randomly with a VS2005&nbsp;soultion I was working on.&nbsp; The message details indicate a problem in VS2010 which&nbsp;I have never installed&nbsp;and, there is a folder: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
 Studio 10.0&nbsp; and I notice it was created the day I installed SQL 2012 Express, so I'll assume SQL2012 installed and&nbsp;uses some bits of VS2010.</p>
<p>I have been searching over 2 hours for a solution and when I found this page thought it was the end.&nbsp;Anyone recall what the fix was?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Can someone please tell whether I can Remote desktop (I have downloaded app) from my WinRT to my Win7 Home Premium? I think I can do other way around but I need to check that as well.<br />

            No you cant, I also have Win 7 home premium and it must be Win 7 Pro or higher or Win XP pro to do remote desktop a real bummer.

The Teamviewer app and computer desk top version is an alternative which is supposed to work with most versions of Windows. I am using it on my RT to log into my home desktop (Windows 7 Professional) and use software on my home desk top that is not available
 for RT. Check it out, it my be an alternative that will work with your Windows 7 home premium

                    <p>Original title: My Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical 1.1A USB and PS/2 Compatible 5V 100mA&nbsp; Cuts in and Out
</p>
<p>Hi there guys my Microsoft WHeel Mouse Optical 1.1A USB and PS/2 Compatible 5V 100mA mouse KEEPS CUTTING IN AND OUT! It is very annoying and just recently started happening. I have owned this mouse for almost a year now. it is not wireless but I just really
 need help. I have tried all the tech forums and searching bing but just haven't found the answer! so I decided to try the microsoft website. I have to disconnect and reconnect the mouse sometimes just to get it to work . It works for 3 seconds to 5 minutes.
 It is just annoying..... Mostly it lasts 7 seconds so I was wondering if you have a solution complex or simple.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Perform a Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<b><br />

<p><span>Note:
<span>&nbsp;</span>After the troubleshooting, place the computer to boot in normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2: </span></b><span>If that does not help,
</span><span>I would suggest you to download the latest drivers for the keyboard from the Microsoft website and then install on the system and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Uninstall the drivers from that are present

<h2>            Out of Stock EVERYWHERE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I pre-ordered my Xbox One and they said me that I will get it before christmas, but now they said me that it's very slow, so maybe in January, so what I try to do is to find one in my city (and after cancel my pre-order), but it's out of stock in all store...
 What should I do?</p>

<p>thx</p>

    <title>guest key removal bug&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heavensxxreaper  say:</h3>
<h2>            guest key removal bug&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a guest key on so obviously i&nbsp;can't add a new account. when I&nbsp;go to remove it, (I&nbsp;don't remember the guest key), I&nbsp;enter a incorrect key 3 times to bring up the option to enter my&nbsp;password to remove the guest key, as the Xbox support states. The thing is, it doesn't remove it. It just goes back to the "System&gt;signed-out content restrictions" page looking and acting as if nothing happened.&nbsp;Has anyone dealt with this issue before and found a solution,&nbsp;if&nbsp;so it would be greatly appreciated to learn such information</p><p><br /></p><p>don't know if this has anything to do with it but I&nbsp;also have the option for the internet blocked except for allowed websites.</p>

<h2>            Cannot validate Windows 7 - getting error 0xC8000247</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
<br />
I recently had my computer serviced, and the operating system upgraded to Windows 7. The Tech's who installed everything verified the windows upgrade, and it states that it has been activated. However, I am still getting a message box that states "this computer
 is not running genuine Windows." It gives me an option to "resolve online now." When I do, it downloads a program and asks me to run the program. When I do, it tries to install and gives me the following error message: "Update Installation failed. Error Information:
 0xC8000247."<br />
<br />
I have searched the forums and tried some of the more frequently recommended remedies - I updated the Intel drivers for the system at the Intel site. I've restarted multiple times since with no change. I tried to install the "Intel Rapid Storage Technology
 Driver" and received an error message that I do not meet the minimum requirements to install the program.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated!!<br />

<span>To properly analyze and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the diagnostic report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop
 - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )</span></p>
<p>
<span>Once downloaded, run the tool.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Continue button, after a short time, the Continue button will change to a Copy button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your post. (please do not edit the report.)</span></p>

            <p>(Jumping the gun - sorry George!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may well find that refreshing the IRST drivers will solve the problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may simply be caused by a bad set of Intel Rapid Storage Technology drivers -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing the Intel Rapid Storage Drivers </p>
<p>try downloading and installing them from here - <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;ProdId=2101&amp;DwnldID=21730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(you want the iata_enu.exe download)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once complete, please reboot twice, then post another MGADiag report.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer Problem&#58; transferred folders are empty&#33;</h2>
                    I helped a friend upgrade from Vista to 7.I have never used Windows Easy Transfer, but it seemed easy enough. When we finished transferring the data, we loaded Windows 7. When we tried to bring back data from the external data, we found many folders, but
 all of them empty. He lost all of his pictures, work data, videos, and music. Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model number of the Flash drive you are using?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Is the issue confine only with Car Radio?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if the flash drive works on a computer. If it does not detect there also and if you are getting the same error message you can try the below steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Code 19 denotes that Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: The below steps applies to Windows7 Computer</span></p>
<b><span>
<p><br />
</p></span></b><span>You may use the<strong> hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong><span><strong>.</strong> Check if it lists and helps fix issues</span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the device works on the computer, you can back up the data from flash drive and format the same. Then check if it works.</span></p>
<strong><span>Disclaimer</span><span>:</span></strong><span> </span><span>Converting a hard disk partition or volume from NTFS to FAT32 requires that you reformat the partition, which deletes any data on it. Be sure to back up any data you want to keep before
 you begin.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Plantronics 925 Headset doesnt install properly - Bluetooth Peripheral Device with a Yellow Bang</h2>
                    I was having an issue with the MOC R2 client locking up when I used my bluetooth headset so i uninstalled the headset and the MOC R2 client.&nbsp; I reinstalled the MOC R2 client and discovered the Plantronics 925 bluetooth headset.&nbsp; The Plantronics 925 shows
 up in printers and devices.&nbsp; In device manage I see "Hands free audio" under sound, video and game controllers but now I see two "Bluetooth Peripheral Devices" under Other Devices and they have yellow bangs next to them.&nbsp; It appears that the driver was either
 uninstalled or was corrupted.&nbsp; These are drivers from Windows 7 and not from Plantronics - how do I get them back? &nbsp;I am still getting a lockup of my system using MOC and I suspect that these drivers are the issue.&nbsp; Any thoughts from anyone?

<p>Persistence pays off! &nbsp;Your suggestions didn't specifically contain the answer but your methodology allowed me to see the issue. &nbsp;The problem was never the headset although adding a bluetooth device certainly caused the issue to manifest itself. &nbsp;The problem
 was with a recent Lenovo update of the Bluetooth software from Broadcom. &nbsp;I uninstalled the software when I noticed that the install date in control panel was just a few days ago. &nbsp;I deleted the C:\program files\thinkpad\bluetooth folder, rebooted and allowed
 Windows 7 to install the generic drivers. &nbsp;I found the Broadcom software in C:\drivers\TPBtooth and ran setup.exe. &nbsp;Another reboot - no more yellow bangs in device manager so I added the Plantronics headset again and still no bangs. &nbsp;The MOC client defaults
 to the Bluetooth headset now and Windows media playback comes through the BT headset once again.</p>
<p>Thanks to all that hung with me on this one - everyone have a great long weekend!</p>

<h3> brandonkoerber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x8007045D - Windows 10 clean install</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to reinstall Windows 10 (via USB) on a laptop with a fresh 750 gig HDD. I get to the partition selection, format the drive, and click 'next'. Installation starts, but after a few minutes (during the 'getting files ready to install' phase), the
 whole process stops, and I get a popup saying 'Windows could not install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code 0x8007045D'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive partition I'm trying to install to is #4, with an available space of almost 690 gigs. This happens every single time, even when I allow the installer to format the HDD from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;I say reinstall because I previously had 10 on this machine, upgraded from 8.1. 10 decided to BSOD on me (code 0xc000021A), and I wound up simply wiping the HDD after a factory reset failed to reinstall the old OS (the machine came with 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, the USB was created using the Microsoft tool for the purpose, and contains both the 32 and 64-bit versions of 10. I know all the files are there, because the same USB can be used to upgrade my other computer from 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing this, and how can I fix it?</p>

            <p>The tool you linked is the one I used. My rig is 64 bit, so I'll try installing with just that on the USB later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: got the stick reformatted with just the 64 bit files. Deleted existing partitions and let the installer do its thing to create new ones. Partition 4 is named Primary, 698.1 gigs free out of 698.1 total space. Warning is saying 'Windows cannot be installed
 to this disk. The disk may fail soon. If other hard disks are available, install Windows to another location.', but I can still click the Next button and proceed with the install - is that warning a glitch? I'm pretty sure the HDD is good, my rig was working
 fine four days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: went ahead with the install, been stuck at 7% in the 'getting files ready for installation' part for the past half hour or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried both command line and 'manual' cleaning of the HDD (the error first started when I tried installing 10 over whatever was already on the HDD), same results as in the original post every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for the previous install of 10 being active, I don't see why it wouldn't be. My laptop came with 8, I upgraded to 8.1 a month or so after it came out, and then to 10 about 40 days ago, give or take.</p>

            <p>That's a good sign. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the HD make on a laptop, reboot into BIOS setup, look for hard drive listing under Storage or HD or Boot Priority order.&nbsp; It may give a serial or model number you can google to find the brand, unless it's WD or Western Digital, or SST for Seagate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What should determine which bit-version you use is whether you have more than 3gb RAM which will see some wasted if you don't use 64 bit.&nbsp; You'd want stronger than an Atom processor, too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did you get the ISO and how is it written to stick exactly.&nbsp; I would use the Media Creation Tool to do it all from.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create Windows 10 Installation Media</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also said you deleted all partitions to get it cleanest, but that they partition you're installing upon is #4.&nbsp; Does this mean there are other hard drives plugged in at the same time?&nbsp; If so I would unplug them as they can interfere.&nbsp; The partition you're
 installing upon should be 0 or 1 if you've deleted all other partitions during the booted install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
This of course is all premised on your having confirmed the Upgrade was Activated because if not then any reinstall will not activate.&nbsp;

            <p>I got the ISO from the MCT. I run the 64 bit tool, it asks if I want to upgrade the machine I'm using or create installation media for a different one. I select 'create installation media' or whatever it says, then let it run. Takes about 20 kinutes or so
 from start to finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The partition I'm trying to install to is #4 &nbsp;on Drive 0, with partitions 1, 2 and 3 created as part of the install attempts. I'll see if I can get a picture of it real quick, in case that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just realized something. I made the stick with my moms computer and Microsoft account, but her machine is still running 8.1. Could that be a problem? Also, is it at all possible for me to get into my account and see if my old W10 upgrade activated, or

            <p>Alright, I'll try the 8.1 install shortly. Only have the one 16 gig stick (SanDisk, USB 3.0) &nbsp;to work with, so this'll be fun...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also. How long should it take for a clean install via USB? I left 10 trying to install for four hours, and while it didnt fail outright it seemingly got stuck around 11% in the 'getting files ready' phase. Should I just leave it alone when that happens?</p>
