<p>Hi,</p>

<p>i am trying to buy a game for $99 on xbox.com and im in uk. I googled $99 and it translates to approx £61. I thought this was a good deal.</p>
<p>So then I go ahead purchasing the game. But when i go to complete the transaction it says $99 and tax. How much is the tax?</p>

<p>Any resident living within the European Union who purchases something from a country outside of the EU would be paying Value Added Tax as well as Customs/Excise Duty based on their specific region. Unfortunately, the only way to know that would be to look
 up your area's VAT and Customs Duty charge before making your purchase. If the item you're purchasing is a digital store item rather than a physical disc, I don't know if Customs applies (since that usually only applies to physical items that need to be searched/verified.)
 I do think, though, that some areas area beginning to charge Customs Duties on digital downloads as well.</p>
<p>Not having purchased something that way, I can't say how it gets charged to you, but if it goes like it does here in the States, the cost of the taxes are calculated based on your location and added to the purchase price of your item. So, if you look up
 what the tax rates are in your area for those things, then add them to the $99, that should give you a close ballpark of what you would pay total.</p>

<h2>            media player can&#39;t find videos after renaming</h2>
                    media player was recognizing and playing all videos (mostly taken with photo camera and flip) but after the files were renamed it cannot find the files to play.&nbsp; When I play them directly from the folders (my pics/videos) it plays it fine with media player
 but I want them nicely organized.&nbsp; When I try to add the folders in media player "no compatible files available" notice pops up.&nbsp;

<br />
<span>Thank you for your reply.</span><br />
<br />
<span>To help review the issue, were the files manually renamed or was the media information updated in Windows Media Player? What folder are the renamed videos located in? Please also relay the exact error message that you receive when you try to play the
 video files. </span><br />

 to uninstall the things I installed and all I can find on my hard drive except from those are system programs and files which I'm not meant to delete. I need 8GB to update but I've got like 4GB left. Is there anything I can do about this</p>

            Hi Farhan,<br />
<br />
<br />
There could be a number of reasons as to why a disk drive may run out of space. Windows Update can also consume drive space, applications installed, and a lot more. If your PC is running low on storage, then you can refer to the steps provided in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12425/windows-10-free-up-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to free up drive space in Windows 10.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Pro clean installation fails during expanding files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro clean installation fails during expanding files</h2>
                    I recently built a new computer after my old one died. I installed Windows 7 Pro, which I had on the old system. Everything worked fine for about a month. Then I started getting various errors, some suggesting a memory error. I ran memtest several times
 using the most exhaustive settings and no problems were found. Upon further inspection, I discovered a critical system update had been applied just before the problems started. I decided to roll back the change. That didn't fix the problem. I tried to do a
 system repair. That didn't work. It only had basic apps like IE11 and Skype. I had also installed the utilities for the motherboard and video card.&nbsp;So, I decided to do a clean install.&nbsp;Every time, it fails during expanding files.The error message is, "<b>Windows
 cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x80070570.</b>" It gets up to around 30% each time. I was trying to install to a Kingston
 V300 SSD (120GB). I also tried another SATA II HDD (750GB) with the same problems. I downloaded a new ISO and tried to install from that. Again, it failed at the same point.&nbsp;I've noticed that each time it creates a System Reserved partition that is 100MB and
 is nearly full. At one point I had a message indicating it needed around 8000 MB of free space. (I think it was while trying to manually expand the files per a tip I found online). I've found several suggestions for similar problems but the suggested solutions
 didn't help. I'm sure it will be a simple fix but I'm running out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>If Memtest86 fails then you need to enter the BIOS and adjust the RAM timing.&nbsp; Memtest86+ displays the timing so use the displayed value and compare to the actual specs for your memory.&nbsp; Also you may need to&nbsp;increase the RAM voltage (in the BIOS) up a small
 amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Intel's EIST function, leave it enabled for now. Then enable it after you successfully install Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=============================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the set of test utilities I use on each new system I build.</p>
<p><br />
Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite&nbsp; and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p><br />
Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p><br />
First run Memtest86+:&nbsp; <br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (<strong>at least 3 full passes</strong>), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p>Hard drive Testing:<br />
If you don't know your drives make and model, Try "Speccy",<br />
it provides System/computer Information in detail:<br />
OS, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Graphics, Hard Drive, Optical Drive, Audio, Peripherals, Network.<br />
Note: RAM option will show number of slots, DRAM Timing,<br />
The speed (Frequency) your memory is running at. The rated frequency for your memory.<br />

<p><br />
Test your drive - Create a Bootable CD:<br />
Anywhere from 5 to 25%, (depending on the manufacture and model) of new hard drives are defective.<br />
Note: Hard drive reliability has gone way down in the last 18 months.</p>
<p><br />
Test your drive using the drive manufacture's utility. <br />

    <title>replacement battery doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markofhesterfinancialsolutions  say:</h3>
<h2>            replacement battery doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I bought a replacement battery that is supposed to be compatable with my HP Pavilion zd8000. It won't charge. I think the laptop isn't recognizing the battery's existance at all. This is a new battery to this laptop. I don't believe it's refurbished but
 it might be. I got it on ebay. My laptop runs very hot and I use a tray under it with 3 small fans. I understand it's typical for this laptop to run very hot and I think that might have been part of the problem with the other battery going bad.<br />
<br />
on the new battery it says it replaces HSTNN-UB02,HSTNN-DB02, 346970-001 Li-ion 14.8 volts 4400mAh.
<br />
<br />
please help if you can.

<p>I am running Windows 10 Pro on my desktop and if I leave the computer on and it is not used for a couple of hours, I keep getting a blue Windows recovery screen that states that windows did not appear to load correctly. &nbsp;If I hit the restart button, the
 computer will restart and run without issue. &nbsp;I don't have any issues starting up the PC and this issue only happens if the computer is idle. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

 and state that windows did not appear to load correctly. &nbsp;If I go into the advanced options, sometimes I can get the system to go back to windows but usually it will just crash. &nbsp;It also crashes if I select restart my pc and I have to force the computer to
 turn off. &nbsp;When I turn the computer back on, windows appears to load correctly and I can use the pc without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can no longer move your Skype account to an old Microsoft account</span></p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1fe11fe4-c2c3-41da-947b-027622d2fd34" title="Nadia_123">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>&nbsp;I can’t link Skype to an old account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Please be advised that there is a&nbsp;new behavior&nbsp;in the process of linking a Skype account to a Microsoft account. To link accounts,<em> the email address or phone number cannot be an existing Microsoft, but can be a newly created Microsoft
 during the workflow.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I can’t move my old subscriptions to my new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Unfortunately, it is not possible to transfer these from one Skype account to another for your account's privacy and security.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I can only add the new account as a family member …. In wish case I have to pay for 5 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>What exactly you intended to do with the new account? Can you please give us additional information so that we can further assist you?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><span>My option is to delete my old account (lose all my emails) recreate a new email account under the new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If your Skype account is linked to a Microsoft account, then it is considered a unified sign in credentials across all Microsoft products.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that, once you decided to delete your account the associated Microsoft email will also be deleted.
</p>
<p>However, if your Skype account is not associated with your email then your Microsoft account will not be affected, you will just be prompted to a page where you need to associate your account to a newly created Microsoft account in order
 for you to delete the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><span>If I delete&nbsp;my&nbsp;New Account, would I also delete&nbsp;my Skype new?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>A: </strong>If you use your email address to create and&nbsp;sign in to Skype, your Skype account will also be deleted.
</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have already tried updating the Video card drivers, but still the issue persists then this might be an issue with the driver compatibility. For the Video card drivers you will have to contact Toshiba, computer manufacturer creates and modifies the
 driver software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download the Video card drivers from Toshiba and then try installing it in compatibility mode and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Download the Video card driver from Toshiba website.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.toshiba.com/drivers</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Install the Video card drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>a.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font><font>Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</font></font></span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>d.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font><font>Try installing the driver and check.</font></font></span></font></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t enter spaces between words within Outlook Express Message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erhankarabekir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t enter spaces between words within Outlook Express Message Rule</h2>
                    <p>I had to re-set up Windows XP Pro operating system on top of the existing system without reformatting the hard drive. Now I have noticed that when creating a new message rule, I cannot enter a space by SHIFT key to separate words in e.g. "From" entry. I
 used to be able to type in a space between words such as the first and last names for people&nbsp;before the re-set-up. When I type words they appear as, e.g. "JohnMcKay" instead of "John McKay", which is what I intend to enter if Outlook Express is to process
 the incoming mail from this sender as I will it. In the previous set-up of OS there was only one user named "Administrator". Now there is still one user with my name appearing as computer&nbsp;administrator;perhaps I shouldn't have typed in my name as the user
 of the computer during set-up&nbsp;and instead&nbsp;should have typed "Administrator" only as the user. I don't know if this made a difference in the&nbsp;consequences of the new set-up of the operating system. I would very much appreciate any suggestions to&nbsp;overcome this
 issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have no idea if the way you installed XP has anything to do with it. If it does, I can't help. But, a few questions......</p>
<ol>
<li>Why would you need to use the Shift key? The Space Bar works for me. </li><li>Why don't you enter the address for the person instead of their name? </li><li>You can try this to see if the registry is corrupt. It is common in OE.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;1.. Close OE and then In Regedit, navigate to this key:</p>
<p>&nbsp; |--HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />
&nbsp; |-----Identities<br />
&nbsp; |--------{GUID}<br />
&nbsp; |-----------Software<br />
&nbsp; |--------------Microsoft<br />
&nbsp; |-----------------Outlook Express<br />
&nbsp; |--------------------5.0</p>
<p>&nbsp; where GUID is the Global Unique IDentifier for your Identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2.. Under that key, you will find the following sub-keys, among<br />
others:</p>
<p>&nbsp; |-----------------------Block Senders<br />
&nbsp; |-----------------------Rules<br />
&nbsp; |-----------------------Signatures</p>
<p>Select the&nbsp;Rules Key and delete it. Message Rules&nbsp;will be empty, but you can rebuild&nbsp;them&nbsp;now.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Note that this will remove all rules.<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>If that doesn't do it, it may well be the installation and I have no further advice.</p>

            <p>This could happen if you changed the password <strong>after</strong> creating the disk. If you changed the password recently then you could use System Restore to restore the old password.</p>

<p>It seems that quite a few people have fallen into this trap. This is the reason why I always have two admin accounts: One for admin work plus a spare admin account for much the same reason as I have a spare key. Here is a complex method to reset your password.
 Ask a computer-savvy friend to help you if you lack experience in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD.<br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands <strong>exactly</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; /d&nbsp; Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; sethc.org&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands and press the Enter key after each of them:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; user&nbsp; "Emily"&nbsp; (or whatever)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see when you last logged on or changed your password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; "KT"&nbsp; 123456<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to set your password to 123456)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Spare abcdef&nbsp; /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to create the badly needed Spare admin account. Its password will be abcdef.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators Spare&nbsp; /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to promote the spare account to admin level)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit<br />
13. Log on under the KT account, using the new password.<br />
14. Log on under the Spare account (because an untested account is close to useless!)</p>
<p>15. <strong>Document the spare admin account!</strong></p>

            I paused the Bitlocker decryption on my external hard drive and removed it from the computer. When I put it back onto the computer to try resuming the decryption process, the external hard drive seemed no longer Bitlocked and when I try to open it I get
 the error message "Drive is not accessible. Access denied". How do I get my hard drive to work again?&nbsp;

            <p>I just checked my file structure and it show the same as yours.&nbsp; Mine shows C and E since my additional folder is from E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I would have expected but your attachment confused me as to what drive was being shown where.&nbsp; I must believe your problem is choosing the entire D partition to back up instead of just a folder on that drive.&nbsp; Since my archive folder on E does
 not contain any recycle bin locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to back up ALL the files on the D drive, I suppose backing up just that should do what you want.&nbsp; If you get a recycle bin and whatever, it is on the drive...</p>

<h2>            No sign in options when fingerprint recognition is blocked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 on a Lenovo E50-70 laptop, it has a fingerprint scanner. If Windows does not recognise the fingerprint after two attempts, Hello automatically blocks fingerprint sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a password set for my account, so I should be able to sign in using that; however when I click on the 'sign in options' link - nothing happens. No other options appear. I am not able to sign in using a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the power button, the computer sleeps, when it wakes again I get the same screen with no way to sign in. The only way I can get back to a sign in screen I can use is to pull the power plug and the battery, and kill the laptop. That is a drastic
 and damaging option which I don't want to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing and registering new fingerprints, but it seems that Windows Hello does not work as well as Lenovo's own fingerprint recognition software, and the lack of sign in options when it fails makes my computer effectively unusable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, please?</p>
