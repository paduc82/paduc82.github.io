    <title>my Administrator account was changed to user by my child now cant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deanneyoung  say:</h3>
<h2>             my Administrator account was changed to user by my child now cant download etc</h2>
                    I got myself a laptop as directed by Verizon to transfer my hard drive contents to when my desktop died, with a Verizon broadband card installed, and i also went all the way and had camera, mike, mouse, special color and design,&nbsp;etc installed-all to throw&nbsp;it
 all away cuz I can't use it for anything!&nbsp;I set up an administrator account then my 14-year-old was allowed to check out the laptop, I even let her be the user.--she couldn't download i-tunes so went and made my administrator account a user account and was
 then going to make her user account an administrator account, "just for 5 minutes", then switch us back (she never reads&nbsp;hints, directions)&nbsp;but as soon as she took me off of administrator a new administrator popped up represented by sunflowers. It won't take
 my or her fingerprints or any passwords we can think of.This was the day I bought it so I've never been able to download a writing app or a photo app (Word Perfect, Paintshop Pro)&nbsp; or add my old computer's contents &nbsp;in and I bought this thing to write a book
 on i've already contracted for and can't afford to just throw this laptop out or buy another-I'm terminally ill and on disability. I hear you cannot help us if we don't know the password yet you obviously set it as a default account and must know what password
 you put in these so I can again make myself administrator. You know I bought this and pay the bill and it's name is my name yet say I can't prove it's mine to deserve that password.&nbsp;Although it looks like the laptop has an administrator it is a phantom one
 only you can tell me how to get past and if you don't can I get my thousand dollars back? because as administrator I had locked&nbsp;my daughter, the user account,&nbsp;off the internet except 2 hours a day yet she changed that right off&nbsp; and got into administrator
 etc which your family safety stuff acted like would work so I had no idea a child could destroy my access to my own computer--I thought i had the control over it, you lead us to believe that when you act as though we can really lock them offline and limit
 other users in any way. I had complete faith in you that as administrator no one could control my computer usage-I controlled their usage of my computer. This is so far, far from the truth and there were no warnings to me anywhere ! (Of course I didn't try
 to change administrator so never read up on that-but then again neither did my little kid. Warnings to computer owners that if anyone wants they can take away their administrative privilege and that this will immediately and forever make the computer useless
 should not be hidden where the parent might never even go-I'd never have gone to ' manage accounts' as I had no need to, never did on my old computer (XP).&nbsp;And the only warning I saw was in this forum where you say it is dangerous to use the "hidden administrator
 account" and that if we get rid of all administrators your system makes one.. Am I to infer that this sunflower administrator was the hidden one or one you make by default as soon as there is no administrator?? How do we learn the password to the secret, hidden
 administrator, and how do we learn the password to the one you make as soon as someone changes an administrator to a user and were about to make themselves administrator? Why can't I just use the CD that came with to install a clean computer like it was the
 day it came in the mail? or did you already have my name in as administrator when it arrived, and it can't be missing or the sunflowers -of-no-password will be administrator as soon as I reinstall Windows Vista?as you seemed to have named myy computer "Deanne-PC?"(Can
 I fix this&nbsp; so I can resume being the administrator of my computer that nobody ever uses
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but</span> me by re-installing Windows, or do I have to throw this laptop out?)

            I can't solve your problem, but am wondering why you set up an administrator account and gave your teen user only priveleges, but didn't put a password on your administrator account?&nbsp; If you had (and she didn't know it), she wouldn't have been able to
 change anything.

<p>After a reinstall of Win XP Home, I set myself as the administrator.&nbsp; I started getting back all my programs, some from back ups and others from a reinstall of the program itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I find that when I switch user accounts to my personal stuff (files
 and folders) there are only a few items?&nbsp; The bulk of the important stuff is only accessible as the "Administrator".&nbsp; The Adminstrator's Desktop has all the "stuff" I use every day while the my personal account&nbsp;doesn't have the basics.&nbsp; No&nbsp;Outlook Express,
 no internet explorer, etc,.&nbsp; I've read that when your doing the every day "stuff" you shouldn't be working as the Adminstrator for security reasons?&nbsp; My Antivirus, Firewall, Malware and Spyware programs are all running when I log in as Administrator, but there
 is basically nothing running for my personal account.&nbsp;I can't download some of these things without the "Adminstrators" (which is me) permission.&nbsp; Did I miss something when I originally set up the reinstall of Win XP Home?&nbsp; Is there some way to transfer copies
 of the Adminstrators "stuff" to my personal account or should I just continue to work in my system as "Adminstrator?</p>

<h2>            Videos recorded by Camera app on Windows 8.1 can&#39;t be played</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I have a Lenovo Miix 2 8 tablet running on Windows 8.1. I used to be able to record videos using the Camera app and then play on it. I recently made many windows updates. After the updates, I made some new recorded videos using the Camera app. The recorded
 videos have extension of MP4. But somehow the new recorded videos cannot be played by anything (Windows Media Player, Video app, VLC Media Player), including the Camera app itself. The Video app would say that it is unsupported format. However, when I played
 the old recorded videos (before the updates), they are ok. I have two problems here:</p>
<p>1. How to fix the Camera app so that new recorded videos can be played back?</p>
<p>2. How to fix the recorded videos that I made recently so that I can play them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely help you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may conflict due to Windows update or third party software, I suggest you to reinstall webcam driver and check it help to resolve the issue. Follow the steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Press “<strong>Windows key” + “R</strong>” on the keyboard.</li><li>Type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” in the “<strong>Run</strong>” Window.</li><li>Search for the&nbsp;Imaging devices and expand the device icon. Locate the driver icon.</li><li>Right click on it and select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>” and follow the instructions on the screen to complete it.</li><li>Restart the computer.</li><li>Check if the Windows 8.1 automatically detects the Camera and install the drivers for it.</li></ol>
<p>After reinstalling the web cam drivers, I recommend you to try recording the video again and check if you can play the video file. And also I would inform you to uninstall all the third party media player and check if you can play the recorded camera file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful for you. Post us with the status, and we will be glad
</p>
<p />

            Thank you for your kind reply. I followed your instruction exactly, but the same problem still exists. Do you think I should uninstall Camera app and re-install it? I was told that I can't uninstall Camera app because it is a built-in app. Really appreciate
 your assistance!

            <p>I am also having this problem, after many windows updates.&nbsp; Maybe we should roll back the updates (not sure how to do this with so many recently).&nbsp; But if you have the dates of the old videos that still play, we could just roll back the windows updates released
 since then. :-)</p>

            But aren't the Windows updates supposed to fix bugs and make the Windows more stable and secure? If we roll back, we will lose all the important updates. I am hoping to have a forward solution than a backward one.

            Yes, for critical security updates, but maybe not for recommended updates.&nbsp; I looked thru my update history, and found KB2899189, a recommended codac update mostly for desktops to read cameras.&nbsp; Thinking that might have caused the problem, I tried to uninstall
 it, but couldn't.&nbsp; So I did a restore, and didn't do any updates.&nbsp; BUT,&nbsp; the webcam video still doesn't play, which surprised me as you said your webcam video used to play before recent windows updates.

            Thanks for suggesting that. I was able to uninstall KB2899189. After the uninstallation, I re-started my tablet, and then used Camera app to record some videos. The problem still persisted. I still couldn't play the recorded videos. So I re-installed KB2899189
 through Windows Update. The problem still persisted. It seems that I am out of luck to correct this problem. So, I am waiting to upgrade to Windows 10. Hopefully it will work.<br />

<h2>            Help with my touchscreen Asus x553m</h2>
                    <p>My touchscreen magically disappeared. I've also checked device manager and found out that under human interface devices (HID), there is NO touchscreen driver. I've used various driver detectors, but still no use. It has now been 2 months since the
 incident and I STILL do not have touchscreen on my computer. Please Help! Under Mice and other pointer devices though, there is a driver called: Asus Support Device. I do not have any Idea what happened to cause me to lose touchscreen.</p>

<h2>            HORIBLE GAME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Heres why...</h2>
                    
<p>It seems as though infinity ward has lost all of their capabilities to make games these days as im sure ALOT of you will agree as ive been hearing nothing but bad things about it ever since the game came out.&nbsp; LOOKS like Treyarch did a better job at creating
 "call of duty" than infinity ward themselves.......&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me being a very dedicated cod player, its hard for me to say this but its come down to this game being an entire letdown.</p>
<p>Here's a list of all the things that drove me to this decision:</p>
<p>1. Game Is extrememly fast paced, much more so than all of the other call of duty games ever released. so this leaves you with one option only, RUN AND GUN.</p>
<p>2a. The maps are INSANELY small and its nothing but a cluster-F.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. These small maps have MILLIONS (yes literally millions) of back routes so you and your team members are consistantly getting shot IN THE BACK.</p>
<p>2c. Theres is NOT ONE out in the open map at all.</p>
<p>3a. Hit detection in this game is complete GARBAGE. When i shoot someone with half a clip, no matter the distance with a m4a1 and get all hit markers, i EXPECT THEM TO DIE.</p>
<p>3b. It seems as though my first 5 bullets do nothing ( mostly on laggy servers).&nbsp; Even being laggy, this should still not happen, then by the time i actually start to get hit markers, im already dead b/c it takes everyone else 3-4 bullets to kill me with
 any gun. ( i swear people throw skitttles at me and i die sometimes)</p>
<p>3c. When im shooting at someone and decide to pull back for cover, i expect that cover to FREAKIN cover me! not have the game over compensate for some&nbsp;bs latency issues and give someone the kill when theyre not even shooting anything but thin air or into
 a 8ft thick brick wall.</p>
<p>4. Problems with the kill streak system.... For one, this just happened to me last night.... it was rather funny actually..... the whole other team, a group of 6 people or so,ALL had support class on. ALL with emp. Domination game, dont remember the map,
 but my team was winning like 140 to like 100. the other team midway through, activated an emp... before that emp had ended, id say like 2 seconds before it did, they threw another one up.... and then after that one, another one, and so forth till the game
 ended. I stilled killed alot of them so i didnt care much but that is an exploit that is RIDICULOUS. having emp's active for all of 6 minutes is pretty stupid in my opinion.</p>
<p>5. Sniper rifles......&nbsp; Hmmm lets see, if you make the .50 cal a one hitter quitter then make it a ONE HITTER QUITTER. Not a One Hitter Quitter***** with asterics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*** may not only kill in one shot if u hit him in the throat or if u shoot him in the
 back. or sometimes u just plain wont kill him with one shot no matter where u hit him)</p>
<p>im sure theres more things i can come up with. and im sure i will!</p>
<p>Bottom line is that Infinity Ward had lost their touch and should have stopped making games after MW2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Call of duty 4: modern warfare was by FAR the best call of duty that was made and after that everything went down hill.</p>
<p>AND for all of you that read this and think im a noob, im not, i average over 3.5 K/d in all of the cods that i own and i know how to shoot a gun thank you very much :)</p>
<p>so unless all of these things are miraculously fixed in the next patch for the game, i consider this one a WASTE of 60 bucks. Thanks IW!</p>

<p>I don't have any of the problems you're complaining about.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I can snipe and hold down an area anytime I feel like it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Hit detection is ~1000X better than Black Ops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Barrett is a one-shot kill 90% of the time for me.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The maps make it difficult to camp, but if you're always getting shot in the back it's because your teammates aren't doing their jobs. This isn't a design flaw. Get better teammates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Why shouldn't a team be able to load up on EMP's and use them smartly? Set up a class with Assassin Pro and an iron sight and you won't even notice it. This is not a problem with the killstreak system.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It sounds to me like a lot of your problems stem from lag. If you get into a game with a bad connection just leave, but know that lag is always going to be a problem with all online games. I have problems even with Battlefield 3 on a full-bar dedicated server.
 And while I do agree that COD4 was the best in the series, it had plenty of its own problems and I feel that MW3 is a step in the right direction after the mess that was MW2. &nbsp;To say that the game is "Horible" "!!!!!!!" is just ignorant, childish ranting.</p>

<p>Yea, my teammates are bad alright, u have a group of 6-10 main people that ive been playing all of the cod series with, with the exception of a couple, we all own. Nothing else really to be said about them... Given that, i know the difference between lag
 and HORRIBLE hit detection. im not THAT stupid. &nbsp;</p>
<p>idk if u can actually call all of 6 people loading up on emp's SMART.... Its something that little simple minded kids do b/c they get owned so bad all the time they just try to drum up something completely obscure to try to have a chance at winning games.
 THATS what i believe that is.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>barret = 1 shot kill 90% on a good server and 75% on laggy server...</p>
<p>and im sure you HAVE had some of the issues im talking about but YOU are just too blinded by the name COD and IGNORANT to even notice them. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>You say you know the difference between lag and "HORRIBLE" hit detection. I would like you to post a video of one of the times you shot someone 15 times with an M4 and they didn't die. Even better, post the whole game in your vault. Then it's irrefutable,
 but until I see a video I do not believe that you have ever connected with 15 rounds from an M4 and not gotten a kill. Perhaps if your enemy was wearing a vest, but I still find it highly unlikely. In fact, post any video you believe showcases this "HORRIBLE"
 hit detection.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Staggering the use of the EMP's instead of blowing them all at once was smart. I didn't say it was a game winning tactic.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>"barret = 1 shot kill 90% on a good server and 75% on laggy server..." &nbsp; &nbsp;Show me some evidence.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Have I been shot in the back before? Sure. Have I had times where I felt like I was getting poor hit detection? You bet. Have bad players using cheap tactics pissed me off? You better believe it. Are these problems unique to MW3 or Call of Duty games in
 general? No freaking way! Every online shooter I've played in the last 15 years has had similar problems with latency, bad teammates, and douche nozzles ruining games. However, MW3 is a step in the right direction and improves on many of these issues wherever
 it can. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            I suggest a different approach to fixing this.&nbsp; As an experiment install a FREE anti-virus product such as AVG or AVAST (there are lots) and see if this fixes the problem (it should disable Microsoft Anti-virus).&nbsp; If it works you then get the option of
 staying with the free one OR uninstalling the free one and seeing if MS AV works correctly.

<h2>            Are you going to fix Wisptis.exe Windows ink service etc ... so it can work with Wacom tablets&#63; </h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi I have windows 7 64bit and a wacom intuos 4, I use 3d software especially 3dstudio max. My problem is that I had to deactivate all the windows tablet services from my computer and all the table windows features in order to work with the tablet
 without the radial shapes etc . But even when i did that, i couldn't right click in some programs. After a while i realised that if you disable wisptis.exe (by renaming) all the 3d and 2d programs work perfectly. But then i started seeing serious problems.
 The snipping tool didn't work anymore and silverlight crashed everytime i tried to use it. So after a bit of search i found the programs that use wisptis.exe and crash and they are quite a lot.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>So the hack is not good. Then I wrote to Autodesk, Wacom and to Microsoft (compatibility pages), and silverlight &nbsp;trying to see if can use my computer properly. I haven't got any concrete reply. It is nobody's fault. Have you heard about any other
 solution ? Or do you know if anybody is looking at the subject ?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance ...</strong></p>

            same problem with wisptis.exe,,, it conflicts badly with wacom drivers, im only using a wacom bamboo yet the same problems exist, wisptis reactivates itself even if i set it to disabled!!<br />
<br />
ridiculous aftercare from both wacom and microsoft, this will drag on like the adobe/ms psd thumbnail view problem..both companies blaming each other again...<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 &#47; Brother MFC-440CN Scanning issue</h2>
                    <p>We purchased a new dell computer tower to replace an outdated one.&nbsp; We are using our same MFC-440CN printer connected by USB.&nbsp; I originally had an OCR program connected to the printer but can no longer find the disk.&nbsp; How can I scan from my printer to computer
 in a PDF format?&nbsp; I already updated the printer software.&nbsp; The choice I am finding is .bmp, .jpeg &amp; .tif.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t delete Norton icon from my desktop.</h2>
                    
<p>Norton Security Scan suddenly appeared on my computer, only it wasn't the actual program, just an ad for it. It would run a scan automatically and then tell you to buy it if you wanted to fix the problems. I removed the program and then went to delete the
 icon on my desktop, but now it's saying that the file is moved and it can't delete it. How do I get rid of it? I can't re-install the program as it wasn't me that installed it in the first place. Any other ideas?</p>

<h2>            Programs Compatibility Application Applications App Apps Game Games Legacy Crash Crashes Hang Hangs</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 32 bit Home Premium, and have tried several times to install "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay", but can't get the game to launch. It is an older game that will run on XP SP2. I've tried to run it in compatibility mode,
 and my PC outweighs all of the games' system requirements by far. A friend of mine has the same game &amp; same O.S. on his computer, &amp; it runs fine. I tried installing the game 5 times from the install CD, (I had my anti-virus turned off during the install),
 &amp; I have put in in the list of excluded files/folders for my AV Engine as well as in Windows Firewall. Windows Defender is turned off. Anti-Virus is MSE. After the last time I tried to install the game I received a message that stated that the game was incompatible
 with Windows 7, but as I've already stated, my friends' computer is running it with no problems. Any input would be much appreciated, Thank You-

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply - preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 (32-bit) come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade a (e.g., Vista) computer&nbsp;to Win7? </em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>2a. Was <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft Security Essentials</font></a> (MSE) originally offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em></p>

<p>2c. What ANTIMALWARE CLIENT version is currently installed? To find out, open MSE &amp; click on the downward-pointing arrow to the right of HELP then select ABOUT SECURITY ESSENTIALS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-</em><em>trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer

            <i>"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay"</i>, will run on Win7 64bit with no
<br />
Compatibility settings, so there should be no issue with Win7 32bit.<br />
I'm not clear as to if the game is installing, or just not launching after installing -
<br />
<i>"but can't get the game to launch... After the last time I tried to install the game I received a message that stated that the game was incompatible with Windows 7"</i><br />
<br />
- Does the game stop installing at the same point each time ? If so, are you using the same<br />
disk as your friend ?<br />
- If you are installing to the default location - Program Files (x86) - has your friend done the same ?<br />
If not, try installing to a non-default location.<br />
- If you have not installed the patch it may help to do so.<br />
(The link tool seems to have a bug lately, so highlight it and select<br />
'open in a new TAB' , or Window ) <br />
<br />

<br />
<i>"my PC outweighs all of the games' system requirements by far."</i><br />
It would still be nice to know what the machines graphics specs are.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw - <i>XP MODE</i> is <i>not</i> suitable for games. It does not do 3D acceleration and is not intended for<br />
or suitable for games. I quote again from the page linked -<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><i><span>Windows&nbsp;XP</span> Mode was primarily designed to help businesses move from

<li><strong>Where you able to play story or nightmare mode at anytime?</strong>
</li><li><strong>You get to the map menu and you now cant back navigate off that?</strong>
</li><li><strong>Are you able to control anything while on the menu?</strong>

<p>I can control everything on the menu except the rb and lb buttons don't work</p>

<h2>            Media Player app no longer finding files on USB device after latest Xbox update</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I put the USB device in now, it says, "No files found". Files that worked just fine recently, before the latest Xbox update. I also tested the device elsewhere and the files were still there and worked fine. Could you stop breaking things, Microsoft?
 Get out of my china shop.</p>
<p>Anyone else having this problem/anyone know what's going on/anyone have any information?</p>

<p>I am having the same issue with my external drive and my DVD/BluRay player as well. It all worked fine till I updated. I have tried all the steps listed in the FAQ/Support Boards. I did find that if I used a smaller drive it works. My usual drive is a 1TB
 drive with a 3.0 USB, I have a 2GB flash drive that I can put a movie on and watch. As far as DVD/BluRay nothing, says I need to connect to a network. I don't have the internet where I live, I have to bring my console to a friend or relative and update there.
 This essentially makes my xbox useless, since there are only a handful of games I can play off line that I enjoy. This makes Sony look like the better option, especially with the New Playstation around the corner.

<p>Having the same issue,</p>
<p>External HD is no longer being recognized now when plugged in. Confirmed that it works, files still exist, etc.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating, as I've done everything listed in the FAQ and all Xbox Support is saying is for me to reformat my drive... as if that's a reasonable response to something that is obviously a problem with their latest software update.</p>
<p>Fix your *** Microsoft! This is ridiculous.</p>

                    Whenever I use the onboard recorder to record my voice, or if I try to use an app like Skype, my voice plays back like Darth Vader on muscle relaxants- too low, too slow. I really am not too brite in this area, so I do not know if this is sample rate or
 whatever. Anyone got any ideas?? is this a setting that I need to redo?<br />

            Hi Mikrich76,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I suggest uninstalling Skype to see if this resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't, I suggest using the System File Checker to look for missing or corrupt Vista files causing the issue.<br />

<h2>            Cooling a Surface Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a Surface Pro, one that was refurbished. However, when I do anything on the Surface, it begins to get hot to the touch. I don't need to hold it often, but I'm worried that the CPU is getting too hot. I can't find fans that might be getting blocked
 and I'm not sure that an external cooling system would do much for the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do?</p>

<h3> docraynes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80070002, SSD Users, Plan of Action Regarding 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I've attempted updating to 8.1 several times. Each effort has failed, producing the following error code:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>0x80070002 - 0x20009</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched around quite a bit and it would appear the problem seems to be one that is affecting quite a few people, all of whom at some point installed an SSD on their computer and then migrated the operating system from a standard hard drive over to
 the SSD. &nbsp;It appears the 8.1 update is unable to deal with those particular circumstances leading the update to fail. It further appears the resolutions I've heard about thus far seem to be either a very convoluted process of re-naming all User files that
 have been moved to the SSD (which may or may not work), or in the alternative doing a complete fresh re-install of Windows, obviously a very big (and frankly, unwelcome) task that might lead to having to skip the 8.1 update altogether.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, my question is what if anything is Microsoft planning to do to address these particular circumstances? I need to know, since if I am going to have to re-install everything its a big job that requires planning, and if a solution is forthcoming from
 Microsoft it would be nice to hear about it so I know if I will be able to avoid all that additional re-installation work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One final note on this issue, if I may..... &nbsp;In researching this concern, I noted this problem seems to be something that has been raised well before the final release of 8.1. In fact I've found numerous references to this issue from when this update was
 still identified as a "preview". Given that, why do you have people playing around with this update, and risking their data (along with their time), without some clear reference to the fact the update just isn't going to work under these somewhat common circumstances?
 I have great difficulty understanding why MS couldn't just mention not to attempt the update if your OS has been migrated to an SSD you've installed. I just don't get it!&nbsp;</div>

            Well I sent you the diagnostics you requested weeks ago, but never heard anything further. What was the point if there was to be no response? Does MSFT have a solution to these concerns, or do you suggest I just simmer down and get an OS that actually
 works?

    <title>Ethernet port not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bartosz kakus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet port not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. I have a problem with my Xbox One. The ethernet port studenly stopped working. &nbsp;I've tried using different cables and no matter which one I use there is no connection. I also have a PS4 and it works perfectly with every single cable I've used. I
 can connect the console via wi-fi but I have poor connection near the TV and wi-fi can be only a temporary workaround, but I need a cable connection. Did any of you have such issue? The console is up to date, I am not a member of preview program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can any of you help me, or should I just send the console to repair?</p>

<p>You could try a Factory reset and see if maybe it's a corrupted driver for the Ethernet adapter, beware though this will remove all profiles and games from the console as well as game saves. Although your game saves are all backed-up to the cloud, and all
 your purchases will be restored and will just require downloading again once you've downloaded your profile again.</p>
<p>I'd suggest giving that a go first as you're only other option is to send in the console for repair, and they'll wipe it anyway as part of the repair procedure, so you'll be in the same boat either way. If it does work after a factory reset, then you haven't
 got to wait around for a couple of weeks while they repair your console.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Don't factory reset your xbox one. That does not work, i've tried it my self countless amount of times. It does not work. If you're xbox detects the ethernet cable and you test your multiplayer conection like me, and it gives you the message</p>
<p>"Not connected"</p>
<p>Send your Xbox for repair. Like i'm going to do.</p>

<p>This has worked for a few users. &nbsp;Sometimes the console just needs to have a hard reset. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug
 the power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then you will probably need to send it in for repair. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>
