<h2>            Region issues with purchases</h2>
                    Both my Microsoft account and my Xbox account have me in the same region, but when trying to purchase any Xbox items, it says I have a region mismatch&nbsp;

Change your Microsoft Store region
<p>I have checked and all regions are correct.... any ideas?</p>

            Yes the card, is of the same region and it all worked fine when we bought the box and the initial games...now i go to get others and no luck....just says
<em>Change your Microsoft Store region</em></p>
Tried with support calls, no success either. at their end they say the box and accounts are in different regions. not sure how as the box hasn't moved since it was purchased..

<h2>            File History files lost after Restore</h2>
                    <p><strong>Desperate... please help!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 Pro, activated.</p>
<p>Corrupt upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro Media Centre, caused the computer to appear that it was not activated.</p>
<p>Any attempt to activate failed.</p>
<p>No option to uninstall Media Centre or restore back to the day before installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the advice of Microsoft online chat, I ran File History and got it to backup all my libraries, that contain photos, videos, documents, music and lots of critical accounting data files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the File History back up was successful and date/time stamped at 13:00 1st March 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good to go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the File History system restore, based on a system image file I'd taken August 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system recovery was successful. I am now back to running an activated Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, all my data, being in C:\Users\[CashInBlack] was now 2014 and not 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went in to the File History, which had contained several hundred incremental backups of all my libraries... and now there were only 7!!&nbsp; The software now appears to only recognise File History backup files from 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I foolishly thought that File History kept its data in X:\FileHistory\[CashInBlack], safe and sound, whilst the system image was in X:\WindowsImageBackup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE LITERALLY LOST ALL MY DATA CREATED AND BACKED UP SINCE AUGUST 2014... AND AM DESPERATE FOR ITS SAFE RETURN!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone out there that knows how to help me... I'd be very grateful and thank you in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get better clarification on this please answer the question below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned ‚ÄúFile History back up was successful and date/time stamped at 13:00 1st March 2015‚Äù.
</p>
<p>Where did you saved the backup? Is it on an external hard drive or on same hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have done system recovery using the system image file created on August 2014, it will show only the files backed up till August 2014, it will not show the files that you took backup on 1st March 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to get the data back is, we have to do a system image recovery using the backup file created on 1st March 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt have the backup image files that was created on 1st March 2015, you may try to search for any third party recovery software available on the web and check if it helps to retrieve the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for a quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system (Windows 8.1, Librarues etc) are all on the internal C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up Windows using FileHistory, by taking an image and storing it on an external USB3 HDD D:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use FileHistory to back up all data libraries. &nbsp;I backed up prior to Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the D:, FileHistory and WindowsSystemImage appeared to be in separate folders, so I assumed a restoration from D:\WindowsSystemImage, would leave my critical data, backed up in D:\FileHistory, safe!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, having used Shift + Restart Windows to commence a system restore, I'm at a loss as to why my back was touched!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I undo the restoration and revert back, to recover data??</p>

            <p>Thanks Siva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure you understand my predicament.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to using Restore, I could happily use File History to both backup and restore files/folders. To that end, File History is superb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files were stored under D:\FileHistory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, having used a system restoration file to fix a broken Windows, C: is performing brilliantly, and naturally I expected to see my data would be as per the date of creating the image file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, whilst I know how to use File History, what I want to do is restore files not seen on C: and recover them from a backup to D:\FileHistory made on 1st March 2015 (backup 172/172)... but File History only sees 7/7 backups and dated most recently at the
 time of creating the system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely restoring an image file from D: to C: would not lose backed up data on D:?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This defies logic and has me stumped, so thanks for your time once again!</p>

            <p>Still no solution found, but a little digging, here's what I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refused to accept that File History backup files would be lost post system recovery... that idea is just mad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've manually scanned File History back up files and found where they were stored, on my external hard drive. The painful bit was that for every time a file was included in an incremental backup, it was included with its filename and a long date/time stamp
 appended to the filename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft... man up... why can I see files backed up on 1st March, when manually searching the FileHistory folder, but the backup application could only see August 2014. That's unacceptable and rubbish!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution: manually copy/paste all the files; delete the date/time stamp appended to the file name and check the copy/pasted version is dropped into its original location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to ensure this doesn't happen again: switch off File History, delete all icons for it, never use it again; then purchase a decent third party dedicated application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was an Apple iMac user, confidently using Time Machine to manage my back up regime. I switched to Windows 8.1 on a PC, purely for File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm saving for a new iMac üòî</p>

<p>UPDATE.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discovered that I am in error, mostly.&nbsp; SEARCH does find the files, but NOT the ones with "-bruce" in the file name.&nbsp; The only thing that I can think of that may cause this is that the name of my PC is Bruce.</p>

<br />
Information about the characters that you cannot use in site names, folder names, and file names in SharePoint<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/905231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/905231</a><br />
<br />
You can try using a Wildcard such as * which means all characters or&nbsp;? which means any one character.<br />
<br />
2016_House*Construction would find all files with anything (or nothing) between House and Construction.<br />
<br />
2016_House?Construction would find all files with any one character (or nothing) between House and Construction.<br />
<br />
Scroll down to "Cortana &amp; Search"<br />

            Thanks Rob but that did not work.&nbsp; I think I have solved the problem though.&nbsp; I renamed my PC to something other than Bruce.&nbsp; After a reboot, I created a new file named...&nbsp; 2016-dog-Bruce.&nbsp; I was able to find that file with Explorer search.&nbsp; I still cannot
 find any other files with "-Bruce" however, but I am now re-indexing everything and I am confident that when done, I will be fine.

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using AQS?&nbsp;&nbsp; name:~=-Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, for your example you could optimize and specify&nbsp; name:~&gt;Bruce&nbsp; then not have to worry about the minus sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have just made me find an old post I made which involved a bit of serendipity:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/file-search-with-wildcards-in-windows-10/cae72309-cb32-46ae-b1aa-bdaf45ba7b99?msgId=c3e4f53e-a137-4c27-9d13-e41a011fe1b2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/file-search-with-wildcards-in-windows-10/cae72309-cb32-46ae-b1aa-bdaf45ba7b99?msgId=c3e4f53e-a137-4c27-9d13-e41a011fe1b2</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then based on that information it looks like you could use Rob Brown's tip this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>name:~"?Bruce"&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I am interpreting the prefix for that style to require the doublequotes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Panasonic KX P1121 Not Printing Properly</h2>
                    
<p>I had recently updated my Window 7 printer driver for Panasonic KX P1121. Upon successfully installed the printer driver, when I tried to print the test page, the printer only printed few lines of strange characters.</p>
<p>What should I do to rectify this problem?</p>

<h2>            Password after sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 8 Pro. My Lenovo desktop PC will not prompt me for a password after sleep, although I have done everything in Power Options (e.g. Require a password on wakeup, etc). When the computer wakes in the morning, it prompts for a password. But when
 it wakes up from sleep after 25 minutes (balanced power options) it does not prompt for password. I really need the pc to prompt for password. please help. Thanks</p>

            <p>Might go to the Settings / &nbsp;PC settings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the charms bar&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the &nbsp; Users item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure it says&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any user that wakes the computer must have a password.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might change it to opposite of what it is now and restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then change it again if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure at the 25 minutes you mentioned its truly in sleep mode - Sounds like it has&nbsp;turned off&nbsp;the screen and not yet reached the time for sleep to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my Lenovo the power button light blinks when its sleeping and full time&nbsp;illuminated when
 the screen is blanked.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer freezing, Microsoft Store background task using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mwiggans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer freezing, Microsoft Store background task using 100&#37; CPU and svchosts being suspended</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally my Lenovo ideapad 310 running Windows 10 freezes up. Windows Explorer freezes which causes the taskbar to become unresponsive and Windows shortcuts and apps (settings, etc.) to not open. Open apps will remain working and programs such as Chrome
 and Office can be run from the desktop or Run. The taskbar will not minimise on fullscreen videos (which is normally how I notice it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting Windows Explorer from Task Manager will cause Windows Explorer to close but not fully start up. Only the basic taskbar (i.e. no 3rd party apps pinned) reopens but doesn't respond and my desktop is blank with no wallpaper. The only solution I have
 found is to restart my system. The first time this happened, it took 2 restarts and the 2nd restart took over an hour, but normally this only takes ~5 minutes when this issue has come up since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spotted two other symptoms:</p>
<p>1: I've noticed that, when this happens, many svchost.exe's become "Suspended" in Task Manager. Unsure if this means anything though.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f54149b-bd1a-47af-9344-5446c3942a63?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f54149b-bd1a-47af-9344-5446c3942a63?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2: This happens every couple weeks but only during the last few times that this has happened, I have found a Microsoft Store background task to be using 100% of my CPU. Ending this task does not unfreeze Windows. This Store issue has not happened every time
 I get this issue however but maybe it's related.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1b4fccb-c252-4436-ae84-03264a07aa49?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1b4fccb-c252-4436-ae84-03264a07aa49?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>System scans with my antivirus (avira) and ADWCleaner</p>
<p>System health checks with CrystalDiskInfo</p>
<p>DISM and sfc commands</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, this only happens sporadically but I will update this post when this happens again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hello MWiggans,
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In order to diagnose the issue, kindly follow the below methods and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Safe mode.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Safe mode</span></a><span> starts Windows in a
 basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Clean boot.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Perform clean boot to determine which startup application or service is causing the problem by systematically turning them on or off and restarting the computer. To
 do that, you may go through the article on </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Clean Boot disclaimer</span></strong><span>: A clean boot starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start
 normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: Svchost.exe is known as "Service Host" or "Host Process for Windows Services". It‚Äôs
 a system process which is used by several Windows services since the release of Windows 2000 operating system. In previous Windows versions, several similar services were combined into a single svchost.exe process to reduce overall system resources consumption.
 But since the release of Windows 10 Creators Update, this behavior has been changed. Now in newer Windows 10 versions, the services which were grouped in previous Windows versions, are separated and run in their own Svchost process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to worry if too many svchost.exe process running in your Windows 10 computer. It's a feature by design, it's not any issue or problem in your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can disable this new feature and force Windows 10 to group similar services into single svchost.exe process like previous Windows versions by modifying the Windows
 Registry. To do that, kindly follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>WIN+R</strong> keys together to launch
<strong>RUN</strong> dialog box. Now type <strong>regedit</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>. It'll open <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now go to following key:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control.
</span></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In right-side pane, look for a DWORD
<strong>SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB</strong>. Its value is set to <strong>380000</strong> by default.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Now you need to
<strong>set its value equal or greater than the amount of RAM (in KB) installed in your computer</strong>. For example, if your computer has 8 GB of RAM, you'll change the DWORD value to 8388608 or larger.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span>8
 GB = 8x1024 MB = 8x1024x1024 KB = 8388608 KB</span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>So double-click on
<strong>SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB</strong> DWORD and change its value to <strong>
8388608</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: If your computer has different amount of RAM, set the DWORD value accordingly. You can
 check how much RAM does your computer has, by right-clicking on Start button and selecting System option.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After changing the value, close Registry Editor and restart your computer to take effects.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><span><span>After reboot, check the Details tab in Task Manager and the number of svchost.exe process.
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Registry Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information
 about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of the user accounts on the computer. Windows often reads and updates the information in the registry.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make unnecessary changes
 to the registry. Changing registry files incorrectly can cause Windows to stop working or make Windows report the wrong information.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Please take a backup of the registry. Follow the steps given in the link below:

    <title>How do i get the xbox one to save network passwords&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grizlbits  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i get the xbox one to save network passwords&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I use one network for non head to head online gaming (career mode in Sforza five). I use a cell hotspot from my tablet for online gaming when latency is critical. The cell network is faster, but it is limited bandwidth. This works well, but to switch networks
 I have to enter the password for the new network EVERY TIME. This is a pain. Is there a way to have the Xbox one remember each password so I don't have to type it in every time?</p>
<p>My general comments on the Xbox one</p>
<p>1 games load ridiculously slow</p>
<p>2 chat is cumbersome and buggy. Why can't it default to chat mode automatically after joining chat?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Switching networks is cumbersome</p>
<p>4. graphics and gameplay are not noticeably different from the 360</p>
<p>5. the connect is decent if you talk loud and clear with no slurring of your words.</p>
<p>6. Xbox off turns off all equipment hooked up via HDMI - pretty cool - I put some of the remotes away</p>
<p>7. Checking latency option is cool and helpful</p>
<p>8. Logging in is more cumbersome - why not log in user automatically?</p>
<p>9. Overall logistics seem more cumbersome than the 360 (checking who is online, you can't ell what they are playing, overall pinning and snapping stuff is just cumbersome)</p>
<p>Overall I feel like the system was rushed and needs a lot of refining. I hope it gets better with future updates.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.Games that are already loaded play slow. Forza is slow to load. I expect games on the hard drive would load tracks and such much faster.</p>

<h2>            webcam problems</h2>
                    Why can I send a video message on skype that works but cannot get the integrated camera to work on a live conference but will work on an older version of Skype, windows will automatically update the older version even when updates are turned off then its
 back to the updated version that does not work.. I have Dell Inspiron 5559 all drivers etc etc have been updated, very confusing and time wasting.

<h2>            Will 120 V 9.6 out power supply work with a 10.83A slim&#63;</h2>
                    Have been having problems with a HDD on a 360s 4GB. Support agreed to replace my unit, but the one they sent is an older 10.83(trinity) per the label and the original was a 9.86 Corona. The power supply I have is the 120v 9.6A out. Will a lower power pack
 be an issue on the older hardware? Concerned about drawing too much on the supply. Thank you

            In investigating, I think the service was set to manual mode and stopped when I installed the Linksys WUSB plug in adapter. I had been using a wireless access point that connected to the RealTek Ethernet port on the Gigabyte Motherboard. The problems started
 when I put in the WUSB AC1200 device to get higher speeds and directional connectivity (floor to floor) to my EA6900 Router in the basement.&nbsp; The setup for the Linksys device must have tweaked the settings incorrectly so that if there was a glitch on the network,
 the Extensibility module was not able to run to reconnect.&nbsp; I will be in contact with Linksys to find out if they do anything with this setting.

<h2>            Windows 10 update 1603 to 1709</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Every day my lap top spends hours downloading the latest Windows update to 1709, at the end I get problems message and various error codes notably 0xc1900208 and 0x80248007. I was also told there was a conflict with an old app but it would not tell me which
 one. I have run various Windows diagnostics and download troubleshooters but no solution. Any idea how to fix and why can't I download the update and save it whilst I attempt a solution rather than using up my data allowance every day downloading the same
 thing. Can I update in safe mode as a way round?</p>

                    <p>There is no sound via USB for Windows 7, and there is no information as to how to correct this.
</p>
<p>Microsoft Answers was totally useless for this, and in fact it gave me hundreds of suggestions that had NOTHING TO DO WITH SOUND.
</p>
<p>You should be humiliated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using Windows XP, all I had to do was to plug my speakers into a USB port ASD EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY.

<p>Why do I CONTINUALLY run into problems like this with Windows 7 ?</p>

Thanks a little bit for trying, BUT that was not helpful at all !  


1. Clicking on that speaker icon in the Notification area does nothing at all.  


2. Clicking on the red speaker icon on my desktop merely brings up a page that says "...there is no audio device plugged in the system....please plug an audio device in the system."  


3. You may feel free to Bet Your **** that there is an audio device plugged into the system. This has been done, checked, and double-checked, I clearly stated to begin with "There is no sound via USB for Windows 7." USB means "universal serial bus", and I have a set of speakers that came - straight from the store - with a USB connection for both its DC power and for its audio input.  


4. As I stated, I have used this same set of speakers on a PC that used Windows XP, and these speakers worked very well, then.  


5. I get the strong impression that someone has jumped to conclusions and not read carefully what I wrote down very clearly, such as that I was usin

            <p>You mentioned that these speakers worked fine in XP so you may have had them for some time, are you sure they are compatible with Windows 7? If not you can check at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Compatibility Center<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a possibility&nbsp;of an issue with the USB ports that is preventing Windows from detecting your speakers. You might check your computer manufacturer's support web site&nbsp;for updates for your system's&nbsp;BIOS and motherboard (chipset).</p>

<div>To answer your question let me ask you : did you up grade from XP ? Installed the correct audio drivers ? Doesn't sound like it.</div>
<div><br />
Go to the pc maker's website. Locate the support page for your model. Download and install the W7 specific audio drivers for your model.
<div><br />
<div>If there are none, &nbsp;try the Vista drivers in compatibility mode. You may get a certain functionability.</div>

            <p>I have a Microsoft USB headset and regular speakers. If I want to use the USB headset instead of the analogue speakers, I use the method I gave to you. It works on all THREE systems connected to my home network. It also works for any other Windows 7 system
 which is working correctly and has not been messed about.</p>
<p>If I want to set the USB headset as the default sound output, I go to Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback tab, click on the USB headset icon and set it as the default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above works on a Windows 7 system regardless of the nationality of the user or any qualifications gained by the user.</p>

<p>You do not know anything about that, and you don't know anything about what is likely or unlikely at all. My PC was straight out of the box, with Windows XP as its original software.

            <p>I've still yet to do full testing in UEFI installs as I need a new system&nbsp;but have a look here, I was given some user feedback:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/download-microsoft-windows-and-office/download-microsoft-windows/download-windows-8-1-retail-and-oem-iso/#USB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/download-microsoft-windows-and-office/download-microsoft-windows/download-windows-8-1-retail-and-oem-iso/#USB</a>
</p>
<p>Use Rufus to create a bootable USB and select the GPT partition scheme as the partition scheme. Select the file system as FAT32. For some reason NTFS doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my understanding that's how to best make the bootable USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside regarding Dell Backup and Recovery, from what I've gathered on the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell seem not to be recommending to use bootable USBs and prefer the recovery external hard drive due to booting issues with Secure Boot/UEFI and multiple partitions on the bootable USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the very old systems I've tested with Dell Backup and Recovery long before the UEFI BIOS, the UEFI BIOS was implemented on most Dells in about 2012 when Windows 8 came out these could not boot from an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The DVD is of course not recommended due to burning errors and the inability of many systems to boot from an optical drive in a UEFI BIOS and many systems not having an optical drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My plan is to get a new Dell system in February after next pay and upgrade my XPS 8300 to have USB 3.0 ports in a PCIe-x1 card. I have purchased a USB 3.0 HD Video Capture Device - 1080p. This will allow me to screen record the BIOS and make a guide with
 UEFI and secureboot. Something my guides are lacking.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Updates Restart Loop</h2>
                    <p>I have had Windows 10 for quite some time now. &nbsp;However, I keep having an issue when the updates install that it gets stuck in a loop when trying to restart. &nbsp;There is a like "in progress" type wheel only on the screen and it gets stuck. &nbsp;After hours - I
 mean 8+ hours - it still cannot seem to restart. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear there is a patch, but I am unable to find it.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Hori RAP to PC Issues Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Good afternoon,</p>

<p>I recently purchased SFV and wanted to use my Xbox Hori Real Arcade Pro Hayabusa fight stick on Windows 10. I plugged in and although the light turns on the fight stick doesn't work when I attempt to play SFV.
</p>

<p>I looked at drivers and other downloadable content that could help. The closet I gotten was getting it to work, except for the RT and LT buttons. After some more troubleshooting, the controller stopped working all together.
</p>

<p>Could someone assist me with the proper driver I am suppose to download? I am not the most tech savvy so watering it down would be most appreciated.
</p>

            You are going to have to check with Verbatim on that one. &nbsp;Generally, these should automatically be detected when inserted and Windows installs the class driver for it for use. &nbsp;If it does not do that, the format it uses may not be recognized.

<div>Check the web link below just in case. &nbsp;When it comes to external storage, pen drives, SD, and micro-SD cards can bring about a headache. &nbsp;There are different classes of them and even though the capacity is within limits, they are not functional except
 when used with a digital camera. &nbsp;That is what they are originally designed for and then computers started to use them as well and the companies that made them, did not put that in the design. &nbsp;It is the architecture of the memory storage is what the problem
 is.<br />

    <title>Cosmetic Issue&#63; Software Issue&#63; My second Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas-cheng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cosmetic Issue&#63; Software Issue&#63; My second Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to start off with the fact that this is my second Surface Book 2. I used the first surface book at work and I absolutely fell in love with it, and I told myself that I needed to get one. I saw that they were coming out with the second model so I figured
 I'd wait and purchase the newest one. Everything was great. I got the 13.5 inch, i7 8gb, 1050 nvida, 128 gb memory version. The display was fantastic, everything ran smoothly and I was genuinely happy about my purchase (although my wallet wasn't).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 2-3 weeks in I noticed that the top edge had a slight flicker. It was as if there was a step down in power just at that one spot. I called support about it and bought it in to my closest retailer and they switched it out for me and gave me a new computer.
 I looked up this issue and it seems like several other of Microsoft's surface products has this flicker. My second surface still has that issue. Here's a link to a video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://vimeo.com/263018571</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you focus right were the screen meets the bezel you can see a flicker. Is very minimal but once you notice it you can't un-see it. Its only prevalent when the surface is idle; as in, you're not moving the mouse, or typing. AS long as you're not touching
 the computer it flickers. Other than that, if its plugged into the charger or your working on it, there isn't a flicker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed just recently there is a slight distortion in color in the bezel (its a lighter black compared to the rest of the bezel). Its like that on all four corners especially the lower left where it spans practically the entire left side of the
 screen (first image). I am not positive if its a oleophobic coating issue where it wasn't properly applied to the whole screen, or maybe some type of thermal damage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These aren't "end of the world" issues, but I paid a lot of money for a device, and these small issues just keep popping up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I just leave it and try and ignore it? Maybe Microsoft will release a software update to fix the flickering? or should I try and get another Surface?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Chin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query&nbsp;on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Code 43 error is generated when Device Manager stops a hardware&nbsp;device because the hardware reported to Windows that it's having some kind of unspecified problem.</p>
<p>However, before try the troubleshooting steps I would suggest you check if the hard drive works fine in another system (if possible).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you try the following steps and see if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Disconnect the device and power off the system.</strong></p>
<p>1. Disconnect the device and power off the system completely.</p>
<p>2. Reboot the system and connect the device after logging in to the system.</p>
<p>3. Check if the device is being&nbsp;recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall Universal Bus Controller.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press
<strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Expand<strong> Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
3. <strong>Right-click</strong> on every device under&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> node, and click
<strong>Uninstall.</strong><br />
4. Restart&nbsp;the system&nbsp;and allow the computer to reinstall the USB controllers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Once all the USB Controllers are installed, connect the external Hard drive again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so sorry to tell you that I had tried both of the methods but yet my system still cannot recognize my ext hard disk. The light on my hard disk show it was working when I connected to my laptop. So I was wondering could my ext hard disk was not working
 well ?&nbsp;</p>
