<h2>            Bad image error on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since last week, I have started receiving a bad image error on my screen whenever I start up my laptop. The message reads :</p>
<p><strong>C:WINDOWS\WinSxS\x86_microsoft.vc80.atl_(..........................).DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Error status : 0xc0000020.</strong></p>
<p>I have tried every thing including an sfc scan but the message keeps popping up twice, every time. Please suggest a solution.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive permanently deleted my video files.</h2>
                    <p>Long story short......tried uploading 500GB of video files to by 1TB account (didn't know about individual file size limit).&nbsp; Obviously, OneDrive did not upload most of the files.&nbsp; However, for some g'damn reason, it synced to my desktop (I never checked
 the box for this folder), and DELETED all of my files that weren't uploaded.&nbsp; And because they were too big, they obviously didn't go to Recycle Bin.&nbsp; They are gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Short of checking my old backup drives, what is best way/software to retrieve these files?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How can OneDrive be so clumsy like this??? (yeah, I'll be logging a support ticket, ee-gads).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<h3> ariandragt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi connectivity issue - enterprise network</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro has issues connecting to Wifi only when using one of our work Wifi networks that requires authentication using domain credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other wifi network connectivity is fine. Latest patches and firmware installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The connection used to work - stopped working this week</li><li>Connection will take quite a while to try to connect and then will end up with "limited" connectivity</li><li>Going to cmd prompt and running ipconfig /all shows that a 169.254 address is all it has - no DHCP</li><li>All other users in the office that I have talked with (including Surface users) for the same Wifi network are not experiencing issues</li></ul>

            <p>This is not the greatest fix, but it has worked for me.&nbsp; I changed the adapter setting to not run on wireless-N anymore, and to only use b/g.&nbsp; It works now, but it is a little disappointing to suffer a speed loss just to stay connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To lock Surface to 802.11 b/g band you can use 'Regedit'.<br />
Open Desktop -&gt; Search -&gt; regedit<br />
Open regedit. Select menu Edit -&gt; Find...<br />
Enter "AutoUse40Mhz" -&gt; do search.<br />
There are 2 such entries in registry. We need to change one, located under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\" branch.<br />
Set "AutoUse40Mhz" to "0" (it has value "1" by default)<br />
Set "Band" to "4" (it has value "6" by default)<br />
Reboot and Surface will connect using 802.11 b/g band</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Do not mess with anything else in Regedit other than what is specifically listed in these steps.&nbsp; Regedit is nothing to play around with, because it is very easy to screw up your whole system if you don't know the values you're changing.</p>

I've asked this exact question on another thread because I can't change the network settings on the router (work). Hope it works! Thanks.

            if it happens again see if the admin is willing to reset the router I wonder if it was reset and that's why it started working again, I had a similar problem though on a much smaller network.

            For me, it was a surface problem connecting to an 802.11n network. By following the registry procedure above, I got it working now for my work and home network, both 802.11n networks. Before I found this registry procedure, I dropped to 802.11g on my home
 network to prevent the WiFi connection from dropping. So, it's seems like the problem I was having is with the Surface and is limited to 802.11n.

</p><p>At 2.4ghz I get 65mbps no matter what I do where as on a 5ghz router I get 270mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>internet speeds are ok, but internal LAN is so slow. On the 2.4ghz router I get 1mbps transfer across the network, surface pro to surface pro or to my DLNA. I can't stream video either, it stops after a few minutes.</p>

<h2>            Unknown device mt7662_p2p showing in Home Network</h2>
                    <p>Recently the following device started showing up in my Home Network.</p>
<p>It says Mediatek mt7662_p2p,&nbsp; but there are no other information available on the properties.</p>
<p>I assume it could be a wireless display in one of my neighbors home, but I would expect to see some more details about the device type.</p>
<p>From the MAC address shown it is not any of my devices or smart TV.</p>
<p>I see this device for a couple of minutes after I boot my pc's and click on the network, but then it disappears.</p>
<p>Should I worry that somebody may be getting in my wireless network or is it just a wireless display close enough to my router that it is picked up in my home network ?</p>
<p>As a precaution I changed the passwords in my wi-fi to one more than 12 characters long. I guess I could also filter out the MAC address, but&nbsp; I rather not change my wi-fi router setting in the ATT U-verse Pace 5268ac.</p>
<p><span>Has anybody seen this device type and explain what this is ? </span></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 10 1803 with Build 17134.191. Checked all my network profiles and they were set for private.&nbsp; I look at the network adapter setting advance sharing options it shows current profile private.</p>
<p>Anyway today I see yet a different display for a minute or so after I boot the pc and then it disappears from the network, see below, it also shows a different MAC address. I guess my neighbor bought a new TV and it is currently powered up.</p>
<p>It looks to me that the latest windows update may have changed something and allows to view all the media devices and wireless displays that are in range, not sure why they disappear after a minute or so ?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I would need to find out which neighbor recently purchased new TV's.</p>
<p>Since I see two different MAC addresses and a different TV model at different times, I assume they have more than one LG TV with webOS.</p>
<p>LG uses the MediaTek chip, the question is how is windows 10 handling these type of devices.
</p>
<p>Are they supposed to show up in the home network even if they are not connected and don't have an IP assigned nor a UID ?</p>
<p>If I turn on my Samsung Smart TV it shows as a MediaDevice and has an IP assigned in my home network, clearly I went through a setup to connect them to my router.</p>
<p>The neighbor's TV's&nbsp; do not have an IP assigned on my networks and that perhaps is the reason why they disappear after around a minute.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should explain how these devices are handled by Windows 10 and if this is the expected behavior.</p>
<p>I would expect to see these devices if I try to Miracast and connect to a wireless display, but they should not appear on my home network even when they are not connected or even when they are powered off.</p>

    <title>After Windows 10 Update, I Reset Computer and Lost Microsoft Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muffnman  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 Update, I Reset Computer and Lost Microsoft Office and Other Apps</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 on my Dell computer, purchased in 2012.&nbsp; A few days ago, I couldn't get past the start-up screen.&nbsp; It looked like the computer was working, but would never make it to the log-in screen...just the infinite circle working
 in the center of the screen.&nbsp; I ended up finally resetting my computer, but it wiped almost everything, including Microsoft Office and other software that came factory installed.&nbsp; I contacted Dell, but since I am a bit past the warranty expiration, they wanted
 to charge a fee and wanted to sell software to me! All I wanted was to get my original factory installed software back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there have been some major issues with Windows 10.&nbsp; Personally, I liked it until the recent bugs.&nbsp; Has anyone else had a similar issue to the one I mentioned above?&nbsp; If so, any success in restoring factory installed software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Muffnman</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a "Recovery Drive": This is what I would do...install the OS from the recovery drive using Dells' procedure, (or install the DVD(s), Dell gave you with the computer) rebuild your programs/apps(including MS Office)...you have to install Office
 and other programs anyway, right!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Capture all&nbsp; your data/files/folders&nbsp;from the computer you want to keep</span> before wiping/installing the&nbsp;D drive or DVD. Remember this is going to remove all your C drive programs and reset the computer to the original
 condition the computer was when you removed it from the box the first time you got it home...</p>
<p>If you go this route, before you start, go buy a 2TB external hard drive, divide the drive into three or four partitions. If you buy WD drive then the instructions for repartition&nbsp;is on their website. It will also supply you with plenty of storage for your
<p>Once your computer is rebuilt with all your programs and you have repopulated all your data and your imaging programs...capture a mirror image of your computer drive, there are two or three free programs/apps available from the web to enable you to do this.
 From that point on, capture an image every couple of months. you will never need to worry about your data again....you have a problem and you can not fix it...grab you external drive and reinstall your last image!...hopefully you save all your data to a cloud
 drive or two, and within an hour, you have solved all your software problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How important are your installed programs and your data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will install the OS that came with your computer. I would capture an image of that system(with all your programs/apps installed)&nbsp;before installing windows 10 again.</p>
<p>You are going to save yourself a lot of headaches in the future...</p>
<p>and you can go back to 7 or 8.1 after your 30 day trial of 10.</p>

 "too bad" you need to buy our product again because I don't have my product key memorized from 4 years ago when I bought my computer. &nbsp;This company is horrible!

<h2>            Trying to upgrade in place an Unactivated Win 7 Ultimate to Win 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I've got a 2008 Dell that I upgraded from XP Pro to Vista Ultimate a couple years ago. It's getting unusable with end of life era problems. So I have a flash drive of Win 7 Ultimate that I just installed, and I'm busy getting updates and getting nowhere
 as usual, Windows Update just yawns.</p>
<p>I want to upgrade in place this computer to Windows 10 Pro in a few days, assuming it will upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried before on another 2008 Dell machine before the Anniversary Update and during the free upgrade period (last July 2016). When I went to install Win 10, it stopped me at the product key prompt and I could not get around that whatsoever to continue
 the installation. It told me to buy a retail copy. I'm told only copies of Windows 10 from November 2015 onward can do this in place upgrade on an unactivated Win 7 installation. However, Best Buy couldn't tell me what version of Windows 10 they would sell
 me, and it would likely be a July 2015 version, 5 months after the Anniversary Update came out! They told me to try the Microsoft Store, but they couldn't vouch for what version they would have either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I fix this? I don't want to pay $400 for Win 7 Ultimate for the few days it's on the computer, and I don't want to clean install Win 10 because of the product key glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other 2008 Dell had a day left on its grace unactivation (back in July 2016) and I unplugged it until I can find an answer for it too. If there is an answer, how do I get the grace unactivation back so I can install Win 10?</p>

            The computer I'm on is a Dell Vostro 400 and the other is a Dell Vostro 200. Both have 4 GB of RAM (32 bit OS). Both are Core 2 Duo around 3 Ghz. I've just switched out the video card in this one to a GeForce GT 710 ($44) from an ATI-HD 2600 XT. I could
 probably do the same on the other Dell from an ATI-HD 3600. The link you gave says Dell hasn't tested these machines for Windows 10 and has no drivers for it, but they probably said that about Windows 7. It is a big question mark whether upgrading to Windows
 10 will work, all I can do is try it and if it works, upgrade the other one.

<p>
<strong>Just upgraded my laptop to windows 7 home premium (which is also on my desktop) and am trying to figure out how to remotely stream
 my media through windows media player over the internet. &nbsp;I have linked my windows live ID on both computers, allowed remote access, and followed all other steps that are in the microsoft help and support files (including port forwarding). &nbsp;I have no trouble
 accessing my media over my network at home, but when i am connected, for instance, at my school's library (where i want to remotely stream my media)...i cannot access my media library over the internet. &nbsp;I see the "other libraries" section underneath windows
 media player, and there are no remote libraries listed like there are when i am connected on my home network (when at home, my desktop's name pops up and i can sift through the files without doing anything extra, but when on my school's network i cannot see
 any libraries at all underneath the "other libraries" section and have no clue on how to get access to them!!)</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Any help with this problem, which i am sure there is an easy fix to, would be greatly appreciated!!!! thanks in advance!</strong></p>

            Well, thanks for the efforts, but unfortunately it still didn't resolve the issue...when I "diagnose connections" under Windows Media Player 12 the connection to my home PC always fails. &nbsp;I have a linked online ID and I went through all the motions regarding
 port-forwarding too, and seem to have no luck with that either. &nbsp;Also, the "teredo" fails and I have no clue what that means, but maybe that's the issue??? &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It also might be helpful to know that remote media streaming does work via another application that I have downloaded called Orb. &nbsp;It works with no issues and all I had to do in order for Orb to work was download the application and run it. &nbsp;No hassle,
 no messing around with my router or network connection, it just worked. &nbsp;That leads me to believe that there is nothing wrong with my internet settings on my home network since that makes it clear that it is capable to stream media remotely over the internet
 with my current setup...just for some reason, not with Windows Media Player 12??? &nbsp;I like the interface in Windows Media Player 12 much better as it is more user friendly in my opinion, so I would prefer to use that over Orb&nbsp;(The reason I know that it is more
 user friendly than Orb is because it actually does work to stream music over my home network, but streaming media over the internet when connected to a foreign network does not work with Windows Media Player 12). &nbsp;Especially considering that remote media streaming
 over the internet is one of the coolest features, at least in my opinion, of Windows 7/Windows Media Player 12, it is a little heart breaking that it doesn't work properly for me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lastly, I have allowed all connections regarding Windows Media Player 12 under my Norton firewall, so that does not seem to be the issue either. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is any other advice you or anyone else can offer, I would certainly appreciate it! &nbsp;Thanks again!</div>

 the app on the entertainment selection, but when i go into the entertainment section it disappears..not sure what i did or if cravetv was a download once type of thing. Is it fixable? Or is it gone forever?

<h3> hansmeister1  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4023057 Error 0x80070643</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 (1803) and got this error above when trying to install the update "KB4023057".</p>
<p>None of the "Solutions" or "Suggestions" (uninstalling, stopping services, ISO-image, repair-tool, a.s.o.) helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to download and install it by myself. .. And successfully installed the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took these Steps (maybe, you only need steps 4-6):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Download of Patch under the official microsoft update download page "https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4023057"</p>
<p>2: Unpack the downloaded package in a temporary folder.</p>
<p>3: Try to run the unpacked installer "windows10.0-kb4023057-x64.msi" as admin via CMD</p>
<p>-&gt; Error "Cannot write to file "C:\Program Files\rempl\ &lt;blablabla&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: Renamed the folder mentioned above to "C:\Program Files\rempl-OLD"</p>
<p>5: Run the setup again.</p>
<p>-&gt; Success</p>
<p>
</p><p>6: Searched for new Updates with the regular Windows-update-function.</p>
<p>-&gt; Success ... Update is no longer shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is enough for you to only run steps 4-6.</p>

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.

<h2>            I cannot &#34;exterminate&#34; UAC for my user account&#33; It keeps prompting me for my admin&#39;s password.</h2>
                    <p>I need help getting rid of UAC (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>PERMANENTLY!</strong></span>) for my account. UAC keeps prompting me for my admin's password when I try to install BlueStacks 2. I am nearly done with my new level in Geometry
 Dash, "Rainbow World", but I need extreme help trying to bypass UAC to complete the installation.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UAC is supposed to prevent harmful programs from being invasive to your PC, not boss me around.</span><strong>BlueStacks is not a harmful program. It ends in ".msi" so why is UAC prompting me for my admin's damn password!&nbsp;</strong>Maybe
 UAC <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should </span>prompt me to open harmful files like ending in ".exe" or ".jar", but NOT ".msi"!!! What can I do to bypass the UAC prompt, so I can finish building my level to enter Viprin's, Triaxis', or Serponge's
 Creator Contests?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UAC is getting more awkward everyday. See below.</p>

</p><p>What can I do to play Geometry Dash on PC? Where can I find a Geometry Dash platform that will NOT prompt me for UAC, or how can I "exterminate" UAC permanently, so that I, a standard user, can install a program without UAC popping up? I am in high school,
 I know what's good and what's not good, I do not need UAC babying me.</p>

<h2>            Ne laptop with Windows 10 - can&#39;t get outlook or skype to work&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; SO FRUSTRATED</h2>
                    <p>Just go a new laptop with Windows 10 ( I hate it already). On my 6 year old Windows 7 machine everything works fine. Try to get skype and outlook operating on the new machine is absolute hell!.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype took 6 tries and 3 hours to log-in. Once logged in it doesn't show any of my info/history/contacts, absolutely nothing shows up. This seems to have now affected my Skpe app on my BB10 passport. Since loggin in on the Windows 10 machine the skype app
 on my BB won't function. It tells me I can't log-in due and to check my network settings. My network settings are fine and all other apps function normally. When I log in using the skype web browser version all my info is there and looks fine. Why won't the
 same info show up on the Windows 10 machine? Why can't I log in on my Passport?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up two email account in Outlook using the exact same info used on my Windows 7 machine. they both appeared to work at first, but then the stupid pop-up comes telling me its contacting the server. Goes on for ever and prevents doing anything in Outlook.
 Only escape is to use Task Manager to shut it down. Found potential solutions online. The one that seemed to work was to prevent all images from being downloaded. but what if I need to see an image in an email... back to the never ending contacting server
 message!!!! I have never seen this on my windows 7 machine. When I download images on my Passport it happens instantly. So why should it take Outlook on Windows 10 many minutes or even hours to download the same images over the same network from the same server?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make Windows 10 actually work????????</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>The new Skype UWP application has now a different layout and user interface, then the classic Skype for Windows Desktop you have used on your Windows 7 PC.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to sign out of Skype UWP and sign in again with the same account you have used on Windows 7 PC.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to sign out of Skype UWP, you have to open your Profile window by clicking on your Profile image shown at the top of the Recent list. The sign out option is at the bottom
 of Profile window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Signing out of Skype UWP will close the application, so in order to sign in with another account, you will have to start this application from the Start window.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Use Libraries to View OneDrive Folders and Local Folders</h2>
                    <strong>Technical Level</strong> : Basic <br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
<p>Since you cannot choose folders to sync to OneDrive with the desktop clients applications, learn to use Libraries to combine multiple OneDrive and local folders into&nbsp;a combined view.&nbsp;For Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 only. Windows 7 follows the same concept,
 however the details are a little different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scope of this article is for the personal version of OneDrive on Windows 8.1 and earlier versions. Please refer to the table below for additional support for the following products:</p>

<strong>Details</strong><br />
</p>
<p>OneDrive is different from other cloud storage solutions because all content is synced through a single folder; you cannot choose which folders to sync like you can with Syncplicity or DropBox. This is a fundamental difference and some people mistakenly
 move their "My Documents" folder into the OneDrive folder; it breaks other functions in the operating system. To solve this problem you can use Libraries view the contents of multiple directories, regardless of folder locations, under a single view, almost
 like they're in the same folder. Libraries are not real folders; they're temporary folders, but that also means you can name them whatever you want. It's another way to organize specific directories under common genre's compared to directory structures.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">How to Add OneDrive and Local Folders to a Library</p>
<p>As mentioned already, Libraries are designed to combine folders and files from multiple file locations under a single genre. For example, the "<strong>Documents</strong>" library by default includes the
<strong>&lt;user&gt;\Documents </strong>folder and the <strong>Public\Documents </strong>
folder. The illustration below shows the logical structure of the <strong>Documents
</strong>library:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e63d3ad-b2ce-4051-a853-0ce8bedaf169" height="276" width="407" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p>You'll need to modify the existing library to include the new OneDrive directory that you create (sometimes it's created automatically when you sign up for OneDrive):
<strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\OneDrive\Documents.</strong>&nbsp;After you include the OneDrive "<strong>Documents</strong>" folder into the "<strong>Documents</strong>" library, the structure will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a09cd1b5-03c8-4318-a2dc-04daf1b416bd" height="259" width="389" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p>The first location is located under the OneDrive folder and the other is located somewhere else on the local file system. If you want your files in "My Documents" to sync to OneDrive, you must move them to the "Documents" folder, however, this is not ideal
 if there are some files you want synced and some files you want to stay local. Use a Library to combine both folders in the same view; we can use the pre-built "Documents" library to include both:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open File Explorer and then click on "Libraries" in the left-hand sidebar or press the Windows key and then start typing Libraries, then press enter when Libraries appears</li><li>Double-click on "<strong>Documents</strong>" to open the view in File Explorer, click on the "<strong>Manage</strong>" tab, and then click on "<strong>Manage library</strong>"; this displays the folders already included in "Documents" library</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b6cb1cc-2355-4f5a-9095-ca1c22dfd56b" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the "Add" button to add&nbsp;a new directory, browse to your OneDrive folder, and then click on the "Documents" folder inside OneDrive</li><li>Click "<strong>Include Folder</strong>" to include the <strong>C:\User\&lt;username&gt;\OneDrive\Documents
</strong>folder in the "<strong>Documents</strong>" library; a new entry appears in the Library locations list</li><li>Right-click on any of those items and then select "<strong>Set as default save location</strong>" or "<strong>Set as public save location</strong>" to change which folder receives a file when you Save to a library (since a Library isn't actually a folder,
 if you save a file to a Library it saves it to the default save location)</li><li>Right-click on any of those items and then select "<strong>Move up</strong>" or "<strong>Move down</strong>" to change the order in which the folders are displayed in your Library</li><li>Click OK to Save your new list</li></ol>
<p>You've successfully added a folder to the "<strong>Documents</strong>" library. You can customize the view more by clicking the "<strong>View</strong>" tab and then selecting "<strong>Group by</strong>" to group by different criteria or don't group at all,
 "<strong>Sort by</strong>" to sort the files by different criteria, and "<strong>Add columns</strong>" to view more information about directories and files. You can include any folder to any library by using this same process; there are no restrictions whether
 it's music, photo's, or other documents.</p>

<p>Microsoft makes me crazy. I'm using Windows 7 and this article is no help at all.</p>
<p>I have the SkyDrive app and somehow I got desktop and documents into it and in the cloud. But I want to add my photos and just can't do it. And in the process I managed to lock up the file now and it says I don't have permission to look at my pictures and
 I can't change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a mess.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for this guide; this is great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1; I want to be able to access all folders included in my pictures library from the left navigation pane in Windows Explorer. I have included my local pictures folder and my OneDrive/Pictures/Camera Roll folder in my Pictures library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first included my OneDrive/Pictures/Camera Roll folder in my pictures library (by right-clicking the folder from the left navigation pane and clicking "Include in Library&gt;Pictures"), the (Camera Roll) folder became visible in the left navigation pane
 under "This PC&gt;Pictures." I could navigate to "This PC," click on the Pictures library, and view the contents of&nbsp;both the local pictures folder and the OneDrive Camera Roll folder in one window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I closed the explorer window and reopened it, I could no longer view the contents of both the local pictures folder and the OneDrive Camera Roll folder by navigating to "This PC&gt;Pictures." When I navigate to the Libraries "location" in windows
 explorer, navigate into the Pictures library, and click "Manage library," both the local folder and the OneDrive folders are listed; I just can't see them both by navigating to "This PC&gt;Pictures" in the left navigation pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi WilliamRozar
<br />
<br />You can record outgoing calls but only Skype to Skype calls. Calls to a phone number cannot be recorded.

            Hi WilliamRozar,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, it does allow both Incoming calls and records outgoing calls.
<br />
<br />Skype to Skype (or Skype number) calls will ring on your device (computer / tablet / phone). 
<br />
<br />How do I record my Skype calls? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12395/how-do-i-record-my-skype-calls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12395/how-do...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            And yes, Skype allow calls. Skype to Skype calls are free but if you want to receive calls from a phone number, then you have to buy an Skype number.

<p>I just turned on my computer for the first time today. The screen illuminates, but is completely snowy. I can barely make out the contents of the screen, through what appears to be visual interference.</p>
<p>Can anyone identify with this problem or offer a solution or suggestion?</p>

<p>In addition to Ifran's suggestions:</p>
<p>- check video cable is secure at both ends;<br />
- try another video cable (to rule in/out faulty cable);<br />
- try monitor on another PC (to rule in/out faulty cable).</p>
<p>If your PC is new and under warranty, just return it.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Senator Diamond Dave,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue can be caused if the monitor is defective or the Video drivers are not loading. You can try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try to boot the computer to â€˜Enable Low Resolution Videoâ€™. This starts Windows 7 using your current video driver and using low
 resolution and refresh rate settings: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Turn
 on or restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 and tap the F8 key about every second until you see the Advance boot options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>From
 the choices available select â€˜Enable Low Resolution Videoâ€™ and check if you are able to boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 you are able to boot, you will need to install the drivers for your Video card that is compatible with Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this fails, I suggest that you start your computer in â€˜Safe Modeâ€™:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps to boot the computer to â€˜Safe Modeâ€™:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Restart
 your computer if it is powered on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Tap
 the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Once
 you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Use
 the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 Safe Mode and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Logon
 to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the computer works fine in â€˜Safe Modeâ€™, try to update the drivers for your Video card. You can check out the below article that will give you
 information on how to update drivers:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If this fails, I suggest that you contact your computer manufacturer as the issue can be related to defective monitor.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Error 0x80004002 while running Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue that has been discussed here, but I haven't managed to fix it: while running Windows Update I get the 0x80004002 error. I have followed a good quantity of advices from here, but nothing seems to work. This problem is kind of annoying
 at this point, so I need to fix and get the updates for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance to get some help with this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I don't think you mean "restart the computer" here. That being said, it <em>may
</em>not be necessary to "reinstall" Windows but it's certainly a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's back up a bit here. </p>
<p><em>Assuming Win10 64-bit, </em>please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]
<em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase Dell Inspiron laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Was it a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer when you bought it or was it a used (or refurbished or demo) computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade from Win7 or Win8.1 [&lt;=PICK ONE] to Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you ever done a Refresh or a Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. <em>Assuming&nbsp;a third-party anti-virus application/security suite is NOT installed</em> =&gt; What Definitions versions are&nbsp;currently listed in Defender's
<strong>Update </strong>tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. What <strong>Definitions last updated</strong> date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2c. What happens when you click on the UPDATE button on that tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08f18d1-700c-4067-8f47-58e323dc2a45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08f18d1-700c-4067-8f47-58e323dc2a45" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a Norton application ever&nbsp;been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What Windows 10 Version &amp; OS Build is currently installed? [tap the Windows key, type â€œwinverâ€ into the Start menu, and press Enter key]</p>
