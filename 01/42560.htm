    <title>Windows 10 screen flashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimh845  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 screen flashing</h2>
                    <p>I have a periodic problem with Windows 10 screen flashing but this time I cannot seem to fix after the latest Windows update. After looking up various fixes I've done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ran msconfig and determined that Problem Reports and Windows Error Reporting are unchecked (an earlier fix).</p>
<p>2. Updated my display drivers (one is a newer nVidia dislay which update the other is an older Dell display which runs on Generic PnP driver)</p>
<p>3. Ran the Norton Screen Fix tool</p>
<p>4. Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton Internet Security</p>
<p>5. Shut down Yammer Notifier which recently updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only after number 5 the problem seem to abate somewhat but it is not completely gone. I am not running iCloud or IDT Audio which are identified online as possible culprits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have other suggestions of things to try? </p>
<p>
</p><p>NOT SURE HOW TO MARK THIS SOLVED SINCE IT WAS NOT FROM ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I FOUND A SECTION IN NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL WHERE EACH MONITOR COULD BE CHECKED OFF. MY SECONDARY MONITOR WAS NOT CHECKED. ONCE CHECKED BOTH MONITORS SEEMED TO FUNCTION FINE.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have performed to try to resolve the issue.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen flickering in Windows 10 is usually caused by incompatible apps or display drivers. To determine whether an app or driver is causing the problem, check to see if Task Manager flickers. Then, based on that information, you'll need to either uninstall
 the app or update the display driver. Follow the Microsoft article below.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshoot screen flickering in Windows 10.</strong><br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to<strong>&nbsp;Uninstall and reinstall&nbsp;the Display Adapter drivers from manufacturer website
</strong>and check if it works </p>
<p>for you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to&nbsp;Uninstall the Display driver:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X key </strong>and click <strong>Device Manager.</strong><br />
2. Expand ‘<strong>Display Adapters’. </strong><br />
3.<strong> Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Display Adapter </strong>listed and click on ‘<strong>Uninstall'</strong></p>
<div>
<p>4.<strong>Restart the computer after its updated and verify. </strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install latest driver from manufacturer website.</strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer the link suggested by <strong>Rohit Chettri on August 20, 2015 </strong>
and check if that helps.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP a6230n upgraded with a SSD drive for OS and programs and HDD for data along with nVidia graphics card and 6GB memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task Manager doesn't "flicker". It disappears with everything else as the entire screen flashes off and on along with a chime sound. I've already run nVidia software which uninstalled the display driver and installed an updated one. However, I also followed
 your steps for Uninstalling the display adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd already followed your first link which points to Norton, iCloud and IDT as possible culprits and dealt with Norton as I indicated which is repeated in your last link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seemed to have this problem fixed previously and it reappeared after Windows updated on 03/09 and the previously applied fixes don't seem to work this time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of my apps have changed. Rebooting my computer causes the probably to be less frequent at first but it only accelerates as I attempt to work on my PC.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions. I've done both as suggested and neither resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have dual monitors and I've found if I use only one monitor the issue does not occur. However, once I extend the display the problem crops up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked and my drivers are all up to date.</p>

<p>I have pre-bought Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition a week ago and went through the download. The download got to 98% and stopped, and this was 3 days ago. I cannot continue it. I uninstall and now I cannot find it, as if I never bought it. Anyone else having
 this issue? Help?This really upsets me and others that want to play it but felt like we gave money for a game that wouldnt even show back up if you uninstalled it.</p>

<p>Hello! I bought the game disc Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition Asian region. Included is the code for DLC "Limited Premium DLC", but it does not show up on my account, even if you switch the region to Singapore. Whether it is possible or to download this
 DLC? I am in Russia. I don't buy a game in the Russian Xbox Store, because I prefer disc version. Thanks in advanse.</p>

<p>Blood - you should be able to restart the download either by finding the item again in the Marketplace or by going to My Games &amp; Apps and scrolling all the way to the right of the Games section until you see Ready to Install. &nbsp;If you do not see the Ready to Install list press the Start and Back buttons on the controller at the same time.</p>
<p>c3040s - If you are having issues downloading or finding the content that was available on the disc then that would be because it is not available for download in your region.</p>

    <title>Installation error with msi file&#58; &#34;1&#58; The InstallScript - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manolofloyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation error with msi file&#58; &#34;1&#58; The InstallScript engine is missing from this machine.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I hope someone can help me with this:<br />
<br />
I try to install a program (ABB Robotstudio 5.07) in my Laptop, I have this system:<br />
<br />
<em>Dell Inspiron N4110</em></p>
<p><em>Windows 7 Home Premium</em></p>
<p><em>Service Pack 1</em></p>
<p><em>Intel Core i5-2450 M 2.50 GHz</em></p>
<p><em>6.00 GB RAM</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation file has an extension *.msi, thus, it has no "execute as administrator button". So, I open normally this file and a window of security warning appears, asking me if I trust that software, then I click in "Run". What happens next is a very
 quick Installer Window, but then this message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1: The InstallScript engine is missing from this machine. If available, please run ISScript.msi, or contact your support personnel for further assistance.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I click in the "ok" button and suddenly the installation wizard appears, with the message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The wizard was interrupted before ABB Robotstudio could be completely installed.</em></p>
<p><em>Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And that is all whath I can do with this msi file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have searched and done a lot, unfortunately, I didn't write (remember) all the things that I've done. But could be sumarized as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have cleaned my computer of maleware, virus and those things.</li><li>I have cleaned it with CCleaner.</li><li>The window of properties of the .msi file doesn't have a Version number. It only says "Install Shield 11.5 Premier Edition".</li><li>I searched and installed all posible versions of the ISScript (I have the Install Shield drivers 7, 8, 9 and 11, but I couldn't find if a 11.5 version exist).</li><li>I have installed some kind of "*.reg" file that allows me to incorporate the button "install as administrator" in the msi file.</li><li>I tried to open the .msi file directly in the cmd window.</li><li>I checked the status of the Windows Installer in the Services window, and it was active and in mode "Manual". I also rebooted (restarted) it.</li><li>I installed the&nbsp;Msirepair.reg file.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think that it is all I've done, maybe another little adjust, but the question is that after all those things, the problem remains. The installer always (when it is possible to open it in those changes) says the same error message.<br />
</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if someone could help me with this problem. So I wait for an answer, and if something is missing in my description, please write me so that I can edit this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p><span>Hi Manolo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community, sorry to know that you are facing issue in downloading ISScript.msi file.
</span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do not worry, will assist you with the issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>Install Shield script engine</strong>, or IsScript.msi, is required for Install Shield installer files. If the Install Shield script engine on your computer is corrupted, you will receive this error message. You might be facing this issue
 due to compatibility issues too.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me keep you informed that this issue has already been answered on Microsoft Community by
<strong>Andre Da Costa on 5/30/2010.</strong></span></p>

<p>Hey ALLISONS,<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the make and model number of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 Operating System is installed on the computer?</span></p>

<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to load your recovery disc?</span></p>
<p>Just as the error code for Windows Update, it will be best if you provide additional details about the other problems you're facing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">About Windows Update error 80240016:</span></strong></p>

            <p>How many times have you reinstalled and activated in the past, this could possibly be the cause.</p>
<p>This time around, disconnect&nbsp;from the internat,&nbsp;&nbsp;do not enter the product key and after Windows is installed call to activate.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. What "Settings" have you tried to change?</p>
<p>2. What other&nbsp;troubleshooting steps have &nbsp;you performed other than changing settings?</p>
<p>3. Did you create the Homegroup from the 8.1 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are facing&nbsp;might be due to Administrator access. I would suggest that you perform the methods below and check if you are able to view the drive in your network map.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Right click on&nbsp;the drive that you want to share, then click on <strong>Share with</strong> and select
<strong>Advance Sharing.</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Sharing</strong> tab and click on <strong>Advance Sharing</strong> button.</p>
<p>3. In the <strong>Advance Sharing</strong> page check the box <strong>Share this folder
</strong></p>
<p>4. Next click on the <strong>Permissions</strong> button, in this page click on the
<strong>Add</strong> button.</p>
<p>5. In the<strong> Enter the Objects Name to select </strong>dialog box type <strong>
Everyone</strong> and click on <strong>Check&nbsp;Names.</strong></p>
<p>6. In the Permission to, you&nbsp;will find <strong>Full Control, Change and Read options</strong>. Click on the<strong> Allow
</strong>or <strong>Deny </strong>checkbox&nbsp;are per your requirement and then click on
<strong>Apply </strong>and then <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 pro goes to lock screen after 5 minutes, despite all the recommended changes</h2>
                    I have windows 10 pro. I have tried every suggested solution out there, changing setting, group policy setting, editing the registry and yet no matter what, after 5 minutes of inactivity it goes to the lock screen. I spend a lot of time of the phone while
 on the computer and don't always move things, so it is very irritating to repeatedly have to log back in. I don't want a screensaver to pop up, or the screen to go blank, I just want it to stay as is for 20 minutes or so at a time.&nbsp;

            Hi, KellyCarroll1
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            The message is most definitely generated by the server and if the message in the non-delivery report is your correct address, then it's the server saying that it doesn't exist.&nbsp; The support people for your mail service obviously are just trying to get
 rid of you.

As of the trying to install the drivers, I did on the HP website by many ways but no&nbsp;successful results. The website could not lead me to a &nbsp;page that describe my problem as of the audio and network adapter drivers. Actually when I check msinfo32, the sound
 device tab shows nothing but in the Device manager I can see AVC (Audio/Video Control device with a&nbsp; yellow triangle that indicate the issue. Is there anything I can do?

<h2>            Match the following. OEM Discs, Retail Discs, OEM Keys, Retail Keys. Which works with what&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I apologize, I know this has been posted many times before. But there seem to be so many conflicting answers, that I just had to get this clarified. Generally I have got very good, precise, and to the point answers and solutions on these forums, so it was
 surprising to see this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I know so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>ANY "Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit" (Let us just call this Win7 from now) Retail disc (Downloaded from Digital River for example) works with ANY "Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit" (or Win7) Retail key. Right? I'm pretty sure it is...</li></ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>An OEM Win7 Disc does NOT get activated with a Retail Win7 key according to most answers. Probably right.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what I want to know is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a Retail Win7 Disc get activated with an OEM Win7 key when it is installed on the SAME computer and motherboard that this OEM Key was originally activated with?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to know this because I am buying a laptop from Dell (with Win7 Home Premium 64-Bit), who doesn't provide the OS reinstallation disc. Instead they have some vague DellSafe Local Backup thing (Version 2.0, btw) that I am yet to fully comprehend. Maybe
 their solution is better than the reinstallation disc, I don't know, but I prefer a plain and simple reinstallation disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I had earlier purchased a Retail copy of Win7 Home Premium 64-Bit through the Digital River thing when I was a student in Purdue with the student offer Microsoft had going (30$ for that copy i think). This copy was provided through the Digital River
 Download service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, once I get my Dell laptop, I will be in posession of ONE Retail Win7 Disc+Key and ONE OEM Win7 Key but no Disc. Note that all discs are for the same version of Windows, that is, Home Premium 64-Bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, once I get my Dell laptop, can I, if i wish, perform a reinstallation with my Retail Win7 disc, and simply punch in the OEM key provided by Dell for the activation? Some answers say YES, it IS possible IF and only IF the activation part is done through
 phone. Other answers say it is NOT possible AT ALL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now someone please tell me who is right in the paragraph above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Some threads also mentioned that OEM keys get paired to some hardware part of the computer, generally the motherboard, the first time it is used. This is the reason that I mentioned "on the SAME computer and motherboard that this OEM Key was originally
 activated with" in the bullet point above.</p>

<p>Yes, you can backup just Paragon, does the same exact thing as Paragon. Windows 7's Backup and Restore System Image feature requires that the drive is equal in size or greater than the one its replacing, very straight forward too:</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</p>
<p>System Image works on the same drive or a replacement drive and it also keeps a snap shot of the drive layout. So, if your computer has a 100 GB drive, and you upgrade to a 200 GB drive, it will restore its exact layout with the remaining 100 GB in the 200
 GB remaining as unallocated space, you only need to shrink and reallocate it after restoring the image.</p>

<strong>That is correct.</strong> </li></ul>
<br />

<li>An OEM Win7 Disc does NOT get activated with a Retail Win7 key according to most answers. Probably right.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a Retail Win7 Disc get activated with an OEM Win7 key when it is installed on the SAME computer and motherboard that this OEM Key was originally activated with?<br />
<br />
<strong>There are two different types of OEM keys, you have the OEM SLP key that is hard coded to the BIOS, these are distributed with new systems that are preloaded with Windows 7 from name brand OEMs such as DELL, HP, Lenovo etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have another OEM key, these are distributed to persons who are called System Builders who build custom computers that are resold to customers. Usually Mom and Pop PC builders.<br />
<br />
<em>More info about SLP:</em> </strong></li><li><strong><em>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:<br />
<br />
A)&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)<br />
<br />
Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computer’s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key.&nbsp; The normal
 way to do this is to click the ‘Start’ button, right-click ‘Computer’, select ‘Properties’ and then click ‘Change Product Key’ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/genuinewindows7/thread/da16dd03-502a-4b21-9c9f-24fd26497a51<br />

<p>I want to know this because I am buying a laptop from Dell (with Win7 Home Premium 64-Bit), who doesn't provide the OS reinstallation disc. Instead they have some vague DellSafe Local Backup thing (Version 2.0, btw) that I am yet to fully comprehend. Maybe
 their solution is better than the reinstallation disc, I don't know, but I prefer a plain and simple reinstallation disc.</p>
<p><strong>Well, you are not gonna get this, even if you obtain a installation disk, since it bundles drivers and other features specific to your Dell system. Its for your convenience if you need to reinstall the OS in the future. Dell should provide the option
 though purchase a Recovery Disk set. The Dell Safe Local Backup software should allow you create backup recovery disk sets too:</strong></p>
<p><strong>http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dellcare/en/backupcd_form<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I had earlier purchased a Retail copy of Win7 Home Premium 64-Bit through the Digital River thing when I was a student in Purdue with the student offer Microsoft had going (30$ for that copy i think). This copy was provided through the Digital River
 Download service.</p>
<p>Therefore, once I get my Dell laptop, I will be in posession of ONE Retail Win7 Disc+Key and ONE OEM Win7 Key but no Disc. Note that all discs are for the same version of Windows, that is, Home Premium 64-Bit.</p>
<p><strong>The OEM key will not work on a retail disk. </strong></p>
<p>So, once I get my Dell laptop, can I, if i wish, perform a reinstallation with my Retail Win7 disc, and simply punch in the OEM key provided by Dell for the activation? Some answers say YES, it IS possible IF and only IF the activation part is done through
 phone. Other answers say it is NOT possible AT ALL.</p>
<p><strong>Its not possible, different keys, different product channels. This is to prevent piracy and provide simplicity for the end user. My recommendation for such scenarios is to create a System Image (backup) of your Windows 7 installation after configuring
 for the first time Windows 7 to save you the trouble if your computer experiences system failure or instability or you simply want to reinstall in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can also customize your Windows 7 installation too, and create the system image, so you will restore an exact replica of your system when you want to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/26/how-to-customize-your-windows-7-installation/</strong></p>
<p><strong>You will need to create a Windows 7 Recovery disk, Windows 7 includes this capability built in, you will also need to have an external hard disk to backup the System Image of your Windows 7 installation.</strong></p>

<em>Windows 7</em> System <em>Recovery Disc</em> </a>
<p>Now someone please tell me who is right in the paragraph above?</p>
<p>Note: Some threads also mentioned that OEM keys get paired to some hardware part of the computer, generally the motherboard, the first time it is used. This is the reason that I mentioned "on the SAME computer and motherboard that this OEM Key was originally
 activated with" in the bullet point above.</p>
<strong>Yes, that is the case, OEM licenses are not transferable. </strong><br />

    <title>Windows 10 connects and disconnects all USB devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>   say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 connects and disconnects all USB devices</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently using version 1803 (17134.228). The only device I have constantly connected is wired mouse. Nearly 2 weeks ago mouse started disconnecting from PC. After replugging it continued working for several hours. The same happened with all
 devices connected to PC. Then devices started disconnecting more often. Two days ago replugging devices stopped working, then I reinstalled all of the drivers related to USB controllers, rebooted PC and that did the trick, but not for too long - devices started
 disconnecting more rapidly (once per 20-30 minutes). Disabling USB Selective suspend didn't work. And even Windows reinstalling didn't help - devices continue disconnecting</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting and reinstalling USB drivers</li><li>Change power setting regarding USB</li><li>Change power saving option from human interface devices</li><li>Toubleshoot hardware and devices (USB supplies power, Windows plays connection sound, but still doesn't work anything, even notification "Setting XXX device up" appears)</li><li>Reinstall Windows</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Павел,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since this issue still persists even after reinstalling Windows, its highly possible that somewhere on your device is the issue but let's try to troubleshoot first before concluding. Can you provide me the following information?<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Have you already tried connecting your USB devices to another PC/laptop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've seen that you're one update behind the latest Windows 10 build. Please try to update to be sure that everything is good.&nbsp;To check for updates now, select the
<strong>Start </strong>button, and then go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update &amp; security&nbsp;</strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>, and select <strong>
Check for updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your replies.</p>

<p>Thanks for moving to correct section</p>
OK, done that. I have disc partitioned to use Mint 17 as I started using GNU/Ubuntu about a year before support for XP ended. As it was the main OS I used I set Mint partition larger than the Windows 10 partition. I checked all the properties and added up everything
 I keep on laptop,&nbsp; about 52Gb of 'my stuff' on Windows drive, the rest is being used by OS and 'reseve'.
<p>I took a screenshot but saved as a word doc, not sure how to post it here? (OK, used Greenshot to take a screenshot of Word .doc)</p>
<p>The Windows partition is 176 GB,&nbsp; old 'Recovery' for Vista 10.9 Gb and about 298GB for Mint.
</p>
<p>It still means Win 10 has taken up 100 + GB of the drive including&nbsp; it's 'reserve'</p>
It's prettyobvious the drive reporting has an issue as it is never going to be possible for windows to report 330+GB being used. I have no intention of using cloud storage, it's just storing stuff on someone elses computer not some 'magical' storage solution

            Additional information, Windows 10 was installed on drive before anything else. The I wasn't sure if I needed the 10.9GB recovery partition so I added it before installing Mint in 3rd partition. If the recovery partition isn't needed I can re-format it
 and add to Win 10 partition using GParted as it seems to be recommended as best disc management software?<br />

            <p>Completely removed Chrome and Skype. Found something called 'Apple Computer' taking up another 5.4Gb so transferred it to thumb drive.</p>
<p>Day later, instead of having 10Gb+ free I have 176mb.</p>
<p>Win 10 is taking any free space and keeping it as a reserve. How do I find out where 'reserve' is and either remove or limit size?</p>

            <p>I found two issues. </p>
<p>The first was very easy to find, page file was about 20% of hard drive. I reduced it to just above minimum recommended sizes. Second issue took a LOT longer to find. I actually only found it by accident.</p>
<p>I installed Piriform Disc Defraggler' and tried running it after removing yet more 'stuff' which gave me 1% free space. I was checking 'Files' tab and saw Apache Error Log was 81,897,871 Kb (or about 78.1Gb)</p>
<p>I deleted file folder (it came back after re-boot, probably from a backup file?)</p>
<p>Did a search on Apache error log removal and it seems to be a major issue.</p>
<p>There are 'instructions' available to fix the problem on servers but I'm not running laptop as a server and I can't find the relevant files to change. I'll keep looking for a better solution but so far this has freed up &gt;68Gb</p>
<p>Question now is do I need to have Apache 2.2 on laptop or can I remove it completely?</p>

            The problem is fixed but I don't know how to mark it as problem solved? I found the answer myself it's in&nbsp; my previous post. The problem isn't totally Win 10 after all (except for page file size) but Apache which I think got downloaded with a Win 7 update?

            The OS is Ubuntu 16.4, as far as I know,&nbsp; the Skype version is Skypeforlinux-64.deb. That is all I know about the version of Skype. I can't find any other information about which version of Skype that I am running. I just assume it is the latest version
 since I only downloaded and installed it. In the past week.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. Sorry to hear that you are getting error codes in Windows Live Mail and you've tried to resolve them but nothing worked. Let me assist you with that. Please remove all your accounts in Windows Live Mail and<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 re-add them</a>. You may check your provider's website or contact their customer service to find out what you have to do to finish setting up your email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: <span>
<font color="#000000">Before removing an account, check that the messages you want saved are available when you sign in to the web version.
<span>If some of your messages are available only in Live Mail, export your messages before removing the account. See

            <p>You probably have a dodgy message on the server that Windows Live Mail can't download. Log into your account in webmail (<a href="https://www.doteasy.com/webmail/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.doteasy.com/webmail/index.cfm</a>) and move all the messages
 out of your inbox into a temporary folder. Then send/receive again in Windows Live Mail. Move half of the messages back into the webmail inbox and send/receive again. Repeat the process until you can identify the rogue message, then deal with it in webmail.<br />
<br />
NB Because the problem is most probably at the server end, removing and then re-adding the account won't help at all. It will just be a lot of work for nothing.</p>

            <p>Thanks Helene!</p>
<p>It turns out that it was an issue with my Comcast modem and WLM not getting along. Comcast came out and switched out my old modem to their newest version - and then I changed my outgoing port to 587 and unchecked the box about the outgoing server requiring
 a secure connection and voila - I'm back in business. Apparently a ton of Comcast customers are having this issue across the US, but PRAISE JESUS - mine is resolved because it was driving me nuts!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

            Thanks Firedog! I just sent Helene a message, too. It turns out the issues was with Comcast (my ISP) and my modem. They came and replaced it and I changed the outgoing port to 587 and unchecked the SSL box for outgoing mail and I'm back in business - hooray
 and Thank GOD! :)

<p><span>Hi Ricardos333,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you certain that the second monitor is compatible with the video card it is attached to (some built-in video cards and even some add-on cards
 don't have a lot of power and can't properly run a large and high resolution monitor - and may not work at all or may work only partially or sporadically causing problems)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: Check the monitor configuration setup</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Check that the secondary monitor is plugged in and turned on. Check the power connections and cabling. Check that the monitor is capable of displaying
 the mode and refresh rates that are set up for it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: Enable “Extend the desktop onto this monitor” and restart the computer</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you connected only one additional monitor to your computer, its icon is identified by the number "2."</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View,
 Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide
 extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>

 Select File, Export and give the file a name noting where it is located. Do not place the cursor within the body of the report before exporting the file. The system creates a new System Information file each time system information is accessed. You need to
 allow a minute or two for the file to be fully populated before exporting a copy. Please upload to your OneDrive, share with everyone and post a link here. Please say if the report has been obtained in safe mode. The request for a copy of this file is additional

    <title>gpt drive reverts to mbr - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmooremljm  say:</h3>
<h2>            gpt drive reverts to mbr</h2>
                    <p>New system build, with 3 terabyte Seagate HDD and Asus M5 A97 R2.0 Mainboard. All mainboard setting are at default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I converted the drive to GPT ( drive space is unallocated). this allows win 8 to install,&nbsp;however, once installed the drive reverts to MBR and only 2&nbsp;T is recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is that even possible???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA,</p>

            <p><font color="#000000">Hi Michael,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Master boot record (MBR)
</strong>disks use the standard BIOS partition table. <strong>GUID partition table (GPT)
</strong>disks use unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI). In order to use GPT partitions, the computer needs to be running in UEFI mode and not the usual BIOS mode. I would suggest you to refer to Motherboard user manual to set it to UEFI mode. Once
 you have changed it to UEFI mode, now you can set the partition as GPT and check if the issue persists.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">MBR disks do not support more than four partitions on each disk and can support only hard drives up to 2.2 TB in size. That’s why only 2 TB of the hard drive is
 recognized.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Hope this helps. Feel free to get back to us if the issue persists or if you need any further assistance.</font></p>
