            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well it really ought to work, but in the past I have met some PCs that would not get past POST (Power On Self Test) if certain external USB devices were connected. The external devices concerned were mainly external hard drives and USB broadband modems,
 but I did also (once) find a printer that caused the problem (or was at least a contributory factor).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all circumstances, booting without the device connected was a solution that my customers found acceptable, so I only ever really diagnosed the fault and provided the 'boot without device connected' workaround (as opposed to actually fixing the fault).
 So I can offer the following observations based on my experiences...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot get past POST (Power On Self Test), i.e. to the point where Windows starts, I cannot see this being a problem with Windows , it must surely be some hardware or BIOS problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tinkering with BIOS settings pertaining to USB may solve the problem. The settings I am thinking of are boot from USB devices (disable) and USB legacy support (try the opposite of the current setting).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, check your manufacturer's website and/or forums to see if it is a known problem (hopefully with a known solution).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that a BIOS upgrade might solve the problem, but it also might not. It is also possible that a BIOS upgrade may introduce other faults to your system either pre- or post- boot. Weigh up the pros and cons of a BIOS upgrade carefully before
 attempting it. Research the BIOS release notes to see if your problem is mentioned as being fixed. In particular try and find out if there is a way of recovering from a failed BIOS update that renders your PC unusable. If you can, do a BIOS update with an
 UPS (Uninteruptible Power Supply) in place which will give the BIOS update time to complete in the event of a power outage during the upgrade process. If you can live with booting without the keyboard connected, in my opinion a BIOS upgrade is not worth the
 risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

            <p>Are you able to post copies of the dumpfiles as shared files to your SkyDrive with a link here?</p>
<p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error
 next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code and related information properly. Select Start, right click on Computer select Properties, Advanced System
 Settings, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the
 option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you get&nbsp; Blue screens of Deaths in safe mode?</span></p>
<p><span>Does the situation improve if you disconnect all peripheral devices except keyboard, mouse and monitor?</span></p>
<p>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></p>

            <p>Have you tried SuperAntiSpyware? Have you checked whether Steps 2 is needed?</p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding
 the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box
 before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the top.
</p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message.
 Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session.
 If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better
 results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

<p>Because connecting to Outlook.com may be the simplest way of transferring folders and messages from Windows Live Mail to Mail on Windows 10. Watch out for step-by-step instructions coming soon.</p>

            Hi Robmcd,
<br />
<br />Unplug your Printer
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the device driver and associated software for your printer
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-color-laserjet-pro-mfp-m277-series/7089945/model/7089949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />Then start the installation
<br />
<br />When asked, connect your printer to a USB port
<br />
<br />Hopefully when that completes Windows will see your printer, though I do know the latest Windows 10 update has knocked out a lot of printers . . .

            To open your nat, power cycle the console, that usually works for me. The match making not working could possibly be a router issue, reset it. And if all else fails, then you may need to port forward, like the other response. Make sure you do network and
 xbox live checks.

<p>Does anyone know how to move an iTunes Library with Ratings, Playlists, etc., to a new Win7 PC?&nbsp; The file mapping will be slightly different on the Win7 machine; therefore a straight copy of the Library.XML file will not work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The first thing to do is to ensure that your music is all together in the iTunes music folder. If you have tracks else where you need to consolidate your library.
<br />
<br />
Then install iTunes on the new PC but don't add any music.<br />
With iTunes closed, drag the iTunes folder out of Music on the new PC to the desktop.<br />
<br />
Then with iTunes closed on both PCs you need to copy The iTunes folder from the old PC to the Music fodler on the new PC so that it replaces the one you dragged out.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter how you achieve the copying - network or via an external drive.<br />
<br />
The last thing you need to do is to check the permissions on the iTunes folder you copied to the new PC, your account needs full control.<br />
Vista file folder permissions help<br />

<h2>            Icons have turned white sheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Today I tried to connect my ps3 to my windows 10 Desktop and a message said that IP wasn't correctly managed... So I used the internal diagnostic tool on the network, and it said there was an IP error... I looked across the web and found a fix: I uninstalled
 and reinstalled network drivers... but after rebooting, every icon became a black sheet (Not everyone actually), like in the image (Note that just Edge, store and explorer, the third are pinned to taskbar)... both on taskbar and start screen (some in the list,
 others become sheets when pinned to start... They become white even when I open the app frome the directory. I tried deleting the icon cache, but it didn't work... What shall I do to fix?</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for replying</p>
<p>No, the only chang I did prior to the issue is to install a Wireless USB Adapter and as I said, to uninstall and reinstall ethernet drivers... The pc has not a maker since I bought the hardware and made it, the cpu is a i3 4th Gen and the gpu a Radion HD
 5450, anyway. My system is Windows 10 Pro 14367 and yes, I know there's a newer version but the public hospot I was using diappeared so I have no way to install it, anyway. I don't care much about that ps3 stuff, I just want to fix this Icon Issue. This is
 unsopportable, something I can't stand with. I hope I explained myself and that I correctly used english (I'm italian), so please, let me know if is there any fix to this icons solutions (By the way I forgot to attach the screenshots, I'll publish them in
 a while).</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I noticed that the issue is getting even worse, from the 45% of the icons, now we're at the 75%... what shall I do?</p>

            I already did it, anyway I'll answer your questions, but I already solved that by restoring the sistem. No, I didn't install all the pendings update since I had no wireless connection to download the latest insider preview, No, the issue was on every installed
 .exe, and when I click, the app window shows up, it was just an icon problem. Thanks anyway for replying

<p>The scanning software is delivered with your printer/scanner, e.g. Brother, Epson etc. You need to read the manual that came with the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When scanning multiple pages you should check the multiple page option (if there is one) and save the scanned document in .pdf format. On a Brother scanner it looks like so:</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a multi-page JPEG.&nbsp; If you scanned multiple pages with JPEG as the output format, you would get just the first page as output.&nbsp; You can scan multiple pages with TIFF or PDF output if your scanner software supports them.&nbsp;</p>

            OK. I now know what you are saying re PDF. Thing is that ship has sailed. What I have now are compressed JPEG files of each document. All of these are contained in one JPEG. I have unknowingly scanned documents as JPEGs. I could open them as photos and
 then read and print out the documents. Didn't even know I could scan documents as PDFs as an option. So now that I have this situation, is there any way of getting at the documents to open each one as a JPEG. I would send you a screen shot but the documents
 contain very sensitive information. Thanks for your patience.

            Hi venkat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br /> 
<br /> See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br /> 
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, and especially if there's none in Dev Mgr.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How To Turn Off Windows Updates Permanently&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masterminduser  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Turn Off Windows Updates Permanently&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am incredibly frustrated! I changed the settings over a year ago to tell Microsoft NOT to update anything on my system. Yet my computer gives me warnings of an "critical" or "important" update that it FORCES me into automatically
 on restart anyway! It simply waits until I am shutting down my system and do a FORCED up date!! Or better yet it keeps asking till I am not around to stop the countdown. So first let us make sure I have everything that can be turned off, turned off correctly.
 Next how do I keep "critical" and "important" updates from ever happening.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And before you ask, please understand that I am NOT an IT professional, but do work on computers and OS problems. So "yes" I have already went through Settings in both Control Panel and Settings, and chosen NOT to have ANY updates. But, again, Microsoft is
 overriding that and still forcing the updates to take place on shutdowns or with a countdown timer.</p>

            This is how I used to do it, but now it just gets re-enabled on reboot just to start another windows update, how do I permanently disable it?

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could actually<strong> defer an update on Windows 10</strong> for months or until the time when you would like to update your PC. Deferring updates
<strong>disables the installation of new features and new Windows 10 Versions </strong>
but do note that Security Updates can never be deferred. To defer updates in<strong> Windows 10</strong>, kindly refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026834/windows-10-defer-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. You can also refer to this
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-info.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a> to know the most stable and recommended current branch of
<strong>Windows 10 </strong>operating systems for either personal or business usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>

<p>I have tried numerous ways to stop MS updating Windows 10, but none of it works permanently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to do this because my recent attempt to update the OS caused my laptop to be inoperable. After many hours of frustration, I was able to revert to a previous install of Win10 Home, version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the advice provided by MS works.</p>
<p>For example, MS suggest "Select the Start&nbsp; button, then select Settings&nbsp; &gt; Update &amp; Security&nbsp; &gt; Windows Update .<br />
Under Update settings, select Advanced options.<br />
Select Defer upgrades."</p>
<p>My version of Windows 10 does not have the option to defer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I have accessed the WindowsUpdate via Services, but when I stop it Windows restarts it soon afterwards. A reboot makes no difference because yet again Windows starts it.</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing me to despair because I rely on this machine for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, fix this problem and stop providing useless information.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a service so updates are necessary, but you can still take control when the updates should be installed completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better guide you, we'd like to know which version of Windows 10 is your device running and the steps that you've tried to stop or delay the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know the version, press <strong>Windows key + S </strong>&gt; type <strong>winver
</strong>&gt; press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<h2>            InDesign CS4 not available in Default Programs dialog</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows Vista w/Service Pack 2 on a Dell computer. The computer had versions of both Adobe InDesign CS3 and CS4 installed. I uninstalled CS3 but now, when I double click any *.indd file Windows asks what program to use to open the file. InDesign
 CS4 (and many other installed programs) doesn't show up in the Default Programs dialog box. I find it using the browse button, but when I select it, and click "open" the it still doesn't appear in the dialog box window.&nbsp;How can I get Windows to see all of
 the programs so that I can associate extensions with the proper applications?I can open the files from within InDesign CS4, but not by double clicking the file. Right now, all my .indd files got associated with DreamWeaver CS3.</p>

<p>Hello Heather M DaVinci,</p>
<p>Click on the KB article number to bring up a Microsoft article about setting default associations. There is an Automatic FIXIT for<br />
Windows Vista. <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article 950505</a>: When you run an .exe file on a Windows<span>Vista</span>-based or Windows 7-based computer, the file may start a different program</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, I would post in the Adobe Community Forums for InDesign CS4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 0xC004F200 &#34;Windows is not Genuine&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Hey, after buying Windows 7 Ultimate through Ebay over 2 years ago, I have suddenly got a "Build 7601 Windows is not Genuine" message in the bottom-right hand of my screen, and the background is black. I installed it on my custom PC that I built myself.
 I downloaded the MGADiag program and these are the results:

<p>Unless you are an MSDN subscriber, you are not entitled to use the Key  and whoever sold it to you was not entitled to do so.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>You need to claim an immediate refund from the vendor - do NOT accept the offer of a new key (all they are trying to do is to get past the 45-day claims window or avoid you sending the evidence of
 their crimes to the authorities)</p>

    <title>Laptop sudden shut down on battery power only, even though plenty of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop sudden shut down on battery power only, even though plenty of battery life left.  Event viewer schannel 36887.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm getting consistent, sudden (less than 1 second) shut down of my laptop when on battery power. &nbsp;Does
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> occur when plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fujitsu Lifebook NH532, &nbsp;256gb SSD (30% space used), 16gb RAM, Intel HD 4000 onboard. &nbsp;Win 7 Home Premium with all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frequency of occurence: &nbsp;10x in the last 30 days. &nbsp;No added hardware/software in the period. &nbsp;Problem repeatable by just unpluging AC adpater and waiting for some duration (most recent about 15 minutes). &nbsp; Occurs with and without opening any programs.<br />
</p>
<p>Attempted remedies:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change power option in Windows - initially to have system sleep before battery power was very low. &nbsp;(Also tried resetting to default power management, turning off screen saver, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replaced original battery which is a few years old but has been 'babied' as has the laptop itself. &nbsp;Shut down still occurs with new battery. &nbsp;Batteries showing 70+% remaining power according to both Windows and BatMon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check system temps with realtemp (not a likely source of problem since it does not occur when plugged in and the batteries are not exhibiting warm temperatures). &nbsp;CPU/mainboard temps below 55C. &nbsp;System fan working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon restart, Windows defaults to 'not normal' shut down and offers safe mode options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to isolate the issue - &nbsp;cleared event viewer logs to get fresh view of log at unintended shutdown. &nbsp;Last event at shutdown shows as schannel 36887. &nbsp;Details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- &lt;Event xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event"&gt;&nbsp;<br />
- &lt;System&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Provider Name="Schannel" Guid="{1F678132-5938-4686-9FDC-C8FF68F15C85}" /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;EventID&gt;36887&lt;/EventID&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Version&gt;0&lt;/Version&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Level&gt;2&lt;/Level&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Task&gt;0&lt;/Task&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;/Opcode&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Keywords&gt;0x8000000000000000&lt;/Keywords&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;TimeCreated SystemTime="2016-01-02T19:10:19.605174600Z" /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;EventRecordID&gt;116476&lt;/EventRecordID&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Correlation /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Execution ProcessID="804" ThreadID="924" /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Channel&gt;System&lt;/Channel&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Computer&gt;GoFuji&lt;/Computer&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Security UserID="S-1-5-18" /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;/System&gt;&nbsp;<br />
- &lt;EventData&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;Data Name="AlertDesc"&gt;20&lt;/Data&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;/EventData&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&lt;/Event&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>I have the feeling the problem can be identified by the event viewer's last entry, unless of course, the system shut down before the event could be logged. &nbsp;I'm not quite tech savy enough to disect event log issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional remedy attempts:</p>
<p>MS Security Essentials - Full Scan &nbsp;- &nbsp;Nothing found</p>
<p>dowloaded Malwarebytes, scanned and found (only) pup.optional.mindspark.a (over a hundred instances).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>It is not surprising that none of those ideas produced a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason the reply that doesn't produce a result is marked as the "Answer" is because the reply that doesn't produce a result was posted by a Microsoft engaged Support engineer "expert" and then the topic went idle for 5-10 days and when that happens another
 Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" marks the reply that doesn't produce a result as the answer even if it is impossible to be the answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case it only took 7 days for the automatic answer marking nepotism to kick in:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82d9ca9a-e31c-45f6-bb4a-d09eb5493001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82d9ca9a-e31c-45f6-bb4a-d09eb5493001" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is how they choose run things in the MS Answers community.&nbsp; It is extremely, extremely unlikely that any reply from a Microsoft engaged "expert" marked as the "Answer" by another Microsoft engaged "expert" is really going to be the answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad truth is that the since the forum owners allow this nepotistic answer marking practice of one alleged "expert" looking out for another alleged "expert" to continue unabated, the MS Answers community is polluted with thousands and thousands and thousands
 of "Answers" that are not really answers at all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also extremely unlikely that the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" is following this topic at all so I would not hold your breath waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do is start a new topic/thread/question about your particular issue so it will appear at the "top" of the list of new and unanswered questions.&nbsp; That will get you the most visibility and best eyeballs on the topic.</p>

            Unfortunately, you are right, and extremely bold to face and report the truth as it is.<br />
I just would like to add my counterattack to this type of 'automatic' prize&nbsp;to poor answers, since it happens also to my threads, and i get very disappointed when, simply by forgetting the thread and letting the dust cover it, the answer given by a noticeable
 user has been marked as THE answer; in this case, the author of the thread, who should remember his open threads, must uncheck such answer through the specific button under the post, such that all the other users get aware of the fact that the problem under
 consideration is not solved yet.

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Step 1:<br />
Right click on the folder and select share&gt; (incase if you want to access the same folder from different computer in future) add everyone and provide read access.<br />
<br />
Step 2:<br />
Right click on the folder&gt; click on properties&gt; select security tab&gt; make sure you have allowed only for "Read &amp; Execute" and "Read". so that they would be able to Play the music but won't be able to delete or modify them.<br />
<br />
Step 3:<br />
Right click on folder and click on copy&gt; open each user's desktop folder (c:\windows\users\(username)\Desktop&gt; right click and click on paste shortcut.<br />
so that whatever the files you add/remove would reflect in their user account.</p>

            Sorry you are experiencing these issues.
<br />First thing first, check to see if your computer is compatible with new feature updates of Windows 10 by the link below by Andre Da Costa.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If your machine is compatible then I would recommend doing an install using the windows media creation tool.
<br />This is the best solution when updates are just stuck and won't install.

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />That crash is caused by the Films and TV app
<br />
<br />Open Settings - Privacy - Background Apps
<br />
<br />Take the Films and TV app off the list of allowed background apps and see if the crashes stop
<br />
<br />If you are running a Core2 Duo, it is likely, your system will not handle the 1803 upgrade, how old is your system?

            Hi,
<br />The best way to fix a temporary profile is creating a new account but see if this helps:

            Hi Sayhai, 
<br />
<br />Are you able to create another account when youre logged in with the temp profile? If so, we can log in as that user, and I can walk you through deleting the temp profile from the registry. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Hi sayhaiharish, this is happening much too often at the moment,
<br />
<br />You should backup your data from that User Profile, create a new user profile and copy your data into that . . .
<br />
<br />Find Your Data and back it up:
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there, back them up to another folder or USB Drive
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Family and other People
<br />
<br />Click 'Add Someone else to this PC'
<br />
<br />Follow the prompts to add a new user account
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />Sign out of that profile and intl the new User Account
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select any old account and click 'Remove'
<br />
<br />Then copy your data into the new User Account
