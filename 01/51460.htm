<h2>            Tomb Raider Definitive Edition goes to black screen when I try to continue a loaded save</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I got Tomb Raider on the 28th from digitally downloading it VIA the Xbox store. It has worked fine, and I even played it working fine this morning. However now, whenever I try to continue my campaign (at 57% done), every time I continue it just
 goes to a black screen and I hear ambient background noises (like birds and wind and such) but the screen goes very, very dark. It looks like my TV is off, but the noises are still playing. I can't do or hit anything. When I hit the home button, it brings
 me back to the main starting screen of my Xbox, and slowly lights up from how dim it is. Starting a new game seems to work as does multiplayer.. what's going on? this is ridiculously annoying...</p>

<p>thank you for the reply, and yes I have. Really not sure what's going on.. from what I can tell from other people's problems, it seems as though this game has lots of issues with Saves/data corruption. I may have to start from the beginning.. but not sure
 if i even want to, if this has a high chance of happening again</p>

<p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FIXED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>ok people so if you continue your Tomb Raider game on xbox one you get loading screen followed by sound but black screen, DO NOT DELETE your save game here is a fix which works, but will require you to sign your profile into another Xbox one and internet
 must always be connected on both xbox consoles to communicate with cloud.</p>
<p>Save game data seems to be stored on the hardrive and cloud but gets corrupt on hardrive, unfortunelty you cannot delete data off your hardrive you can delete the game but save games do not get deleted.</p>
<p>here are the steps you take:-</p>
<p>Install Tomb Raider on another Xbox One,</p>
<p>Sign in your profile on xbox before starting game,</p>
<p>when the game starts allow it to complete syncing data,</p>
<p>continue your game noting % (eg. 60%) played and you will notice it will work,</p>
<p>play for about 20mins and make sure you advance to another checkpoint in game,</p>
<p>BE WARNED YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT AT THIS PER XBOX MAKE SURE &nbsp;YOU ADVANCE IN THE GAME OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET BLACK SCREEN ON BOTH XBOXS</p>
<p>make sure game autosaves,</p>
<p>exit game,</p>
<p>go back to continue game and your % played must be higher than when you started (eg. 61%)</p>
<p>now you will be able to play again on your own xbox (Internet must be connected)</p>
<p>the other way im sure would work but not untested is to factory reset xbox this will mean your save data will be downloaded from cloud.</p>
<p>i was lucky to figure this out and was only made possible as my son has an xbox one.</p>
<p>this works perfectly and if you dont have use of another xbox, maybe another user with tomb raider can help i will help any person</p>
<p>any problem mail me &nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or request my friendship &nbsp; &nbsp;kil13rChap81 on xbox live</p>

<p>You CAN actually delete your save game data locally on your xbox and leave it in the cloud. Go to your games/apps section in dashboard and go to the game in question. There are options to delete the local save game data and save game data in the cloud. You
 can delete local data or delete local and cloud data.</p>

    <title>Why is there a discrepancy with disk space usage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is there a discrepancy with disk space usage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a old hard drive from an older XP machine. I connected it up externally to take a snap of the data for backup purposes. The hard drive is 80GB and Windows is reporting that there is 21GB free (or 69GB used). If I take the properties of all the files
 (including hidden and system files), it is showing 60GB worth of data. I did a clone of the disk and that container also was 60GB.&nbsp;Why does the 'pie chart' say 69GB? Where is the 9GB? I've also run chkdsk as well.</p>
<p><br />
Just makes me nervous that I'm missing some data...</p>

            You have at least three different things that may be confusing you.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The most likely reason for a "discrepancy" as large as 9 GB is the System Volume Information folder.&nbsp; This "super hidden" folder is primarily used for System Restore points, but also can include content indexing databases (when you permit the default behavior
 of "Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching").&nbsp; Even though you can see the System Volume Information folder in Windows Explorer when you uncheck the option to "hide protected operating system files," it reports a size of 0 bytes
 -- regardless of what is actually in the folder.<br />
<br />
Although there is a way to access the SVI folder -- which is strongly discouraged -- start by opening System Restore and see how many restore points you have.&nbsp; By default, Windows XP allocates 12% of the partition size for System Restore, so if you have a nominal
 80 GB partition, you would have 9.6 GB allocated for SR.&nbsp; Assuming that you've been running for some time, that allocation is probably filled up (old restore points are deleted on a FIFO basis as new ones are created).<br />
<br />
If you're reasonably confident in the stability of your system, run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr.exe &gt; OK) and select the "More options" tab.&nbsp; Then click the "Cleanup" button in the "System Restore" section to delete all but the most recent restore
 point.&nbsp; If you do this, my guess is that your 9 GB discrepancy will disappear.<br />
<br />
In addition to the SVI folder, there are a couple of relatively minor points:<br />
<br />
Not all "gigabytes" are the same.&nbsp; When a disk manufacturer says that you have an 80 GB drive, it means that your drive has approximately 80,000,000,000 bytes.&nbsp; Windows would report a drive of that size as having 80,000,000,000 / 1,073,741,824 = 74.51 GB (where
 1,073,741,824 is 1024*1024*1024).<br />
<br />
In addition, there is a difference between the number of bytes in a file (the "size" reported by Windows when you look at a file's properties) and the space occupied by the file on the hard drive.&nbsp; Windows reports this as the file's "size on disk."<br />
<br />
For most recent Windows operating systems, including XP, the default "cluster size" for NTFS-formatted drives is 4 KB.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/140365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/140365</a>.&nbsp; When a file is saves to the hard drive, it occupies an integral number of clusters.&nbsp; On average, half the cluster size is "wasted" for every file stored.&nbsp;
 For a drive with a normal mix of file sizes and about 150,000 files, only about 300 MB of space will be wasted.<br />
<br />
P.S.:&nbsp; You should reduce the allocation of SR space to about 1 GB.&nbsp; See <a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/diskspace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            This is how I fixed Windows Store back to normal</h2>
                    <p>Hi Windows People,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't open Windows Store App and I have found this way to solve. Thought of sharing it with you all... Hope it will be fixed without a PC Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download the file and extract to Downloads folder. (I had to turn off my virus guard)</p>
<p>http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/F/0/5F04003A-035E-4A0F-9662-43E32C546F6C/reinstall-preinstalledApps.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Windows Power Shell ISE</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Type =&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Press <strong>Y </strong>when it asks whether&nbsp;you change the execution policy, and press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Type =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd C:\Users\<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>YourUserName</strong></span>\Downloads</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Type =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\reinstall-preinstalledApps.ps1 *Microsoft.WindowsStore*</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Open <strong>Start Menu </strong>and type <strong>WSReset.exe </strong>and open it</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This has been fixed for me. </strong></p>

<p><span>Hi Daniyal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It could be due to the <strong>Self-Encryption </strong>feature of the Seagate Portable Drives. The
<strong>Auto-Lock </strong>feature automatically locks the drive and secures its data the instant a drive is removed from a system, or the moment the drive or system is turned off. For more information, I would suggest you to go through the article:
</span><a href="https://www.seagate.com/in/en/tech-insights/protect-data-with-seagate-secure-self-encrypting-drives-master-ti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Protect your Data with Seagate Secure Self-Encrypting Drives</span></a><span>.

<p>The internal dvd/cd player on my gateway NV79, windows 7, with matshita dvd-ram uj890AS ATA used to work fine.&nbsp; When I go to Computer it only shows the c: drive.&nbsp; I took it to a shop for some work and now my computer no longer sees it.&nbsp; I don't want to return
 there - it's the 2nd time they screwed something up.</p>
<p>I ran a diagnostic and came up with</p>
<p>"A driver (service) for this device has been disabled.<span>&nbsp; </span>An alternate driver may be providing this functionality. (Code 32)"</p>

<p>These steps, to remove the UpperFilters and LowerFilters values, if they exist, at the named registry key may help.</p>

    <title>Stealth update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony ronaldo volkertdoop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stealth update</h2>
                    <p>Okay, </p>
<p>Cant we get at least some reminder like the normal update ? </p>
<p>this stealth upgrade just make everything go downhill for me</p>
<p>Please, can't we get at least a way to delay it, don't think like a few MB can't screw everything, not everyone can get a 1GB/s internet...</p>
<p>some of us are struggling with 1mb/s internet or even less, so this stealth update you guys doing (yes, you guys Microsoft ) are making everything go into a mess</p>
<p>The moment the update comes in, i cant do anything at all with my internet.</p>
<p>Maybe, you guys can do 1 of this thing, if you guys insist that we need the update :</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Let us know when u guys will do this</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Let us postpone it</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Make it like the normal update ( which data is downloaded by this ninja update that screw everything for me)</p>
<p>I mean, i know this is a feature that supposed to make us comfortable, but the thing is, its not.</p>
<p>How many people need to complain until you guys at least look at this problem ?</p>
<p>Oh, i used this thing already : "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them"
</p>
<p>but the update this "steps" postpone, and the update I'm talking about is different</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Epson C88&#43; not showing in devices and printers</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;I have an epson C88+ connected. &nbsp;I can see the printer from within applications (ie excel, word, etd.) but in "devices and printers" the icon for the printer does NOT exist. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling
 and re-installing the printer several times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer "had" been set up as a shared printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While i can still print from the local machine, the printer is no longer visible to other computers in the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found a few posts regarding this topic but so far have not found any solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>First for the equipment....I am using a Dell XPS 8700 computer. &nbsp;The printer is an Epson Stylus C88+</p>
<p>Running Windows 10 Pro &nbsp;64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer shows properly under device manager under the printer section. &nbsp;Attempts to update driver software indicate that the current driver is the most current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running troubleshooting for the printer yields no problems with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is connected and i am able to print from the local computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer however does not show up under "devices and printers". &nbsp;My other printer options, predominantly PDF writers do show up. &nbsp;Just not the Epson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the printer using device manager. &nbsp;Rebooting adds it back, however it still does not show up in "devices and printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

</p><p>When I said "You could try installing an older version of Windows..." I was speaking of Windows 7. The old software you want to use was written for and works well with the old operating system. Windows 7 will remain a viable operating system for @ four more
 years. There is no reason to concern yourself with complaining about it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you choose to continue using the old software and operating systems... I would request that you refrain from using it to interact with the same Internet the rest of us want to use safely, or complaining when you become one of the 1 in 4 people
 with identity theft issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, there is no solution to using BCM with the latest update to Windows 10. BCM is old, unsupported software, it has been superseded by things like Skype, Delve, Yammer, the ability to create apps to do what you like, etc....</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>BCM works fine with W10, and also in office 2013, so….&nbsp; I would not call it old. And MS are still developing:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>By the way, people advising (in &nbsp;the MS community) rolling back to W7 are probably more dangerous to our internet than people asking for a solution to the latest updates.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>A simple Office 365 E3 account will provide you with what any small business needs, concerning anything you have mentioned. Fully encompassing the features of the old BCM.</p>

<p>hey there, i know this problem can be caused by a few things because i had the same problem. depeneding on the game, sometimes you can just press "F" and the screen will go to full screen, or try going to the options in the game and changing the resolution
 or screen size in the video options.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Where is the option to turn off all this Metro fiasco</h2>
                    Is there a button to turn off this horrid flat looking and nasty Metro interface and get back to the real desktop for adults to work on.&nbsp; This horrid Hello Kitty type look is really distracting and childish.<br />
<br />
But if MS wont set it up to be disabled I see that the developers are hard at work doing so.<br />
<br />
Here is the first attempt and a complete new Explorer shell has been written that completely disables Metro from even being loaded.<br />
<br />
Looks like a good start, see here.<br />

            Hi,

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Modern User Interface is one of the main new feature introduced in Windows 8 operating system, when compared with the previous version of Windows operating system.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is by design and cannot be turned off or disabled. </div>

            <p>Why would Microsoft make this limited. It should be a user choice. I paid a few hundred dollars for 2 copies of Windows 8 and I find myself clicking and re-attempting actions to often. Like the IE in task bar gets overlaid by the start menu and when I move
 my mouse over to the edge of the screen my cursor goes to my other monitor and I either click on IE by accident or have to re-attempt the start menu. It's not a know how thing here, It's just a big hassle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find myself clicking more often and having to go to the charm bar and start menu to execute items more then need be. This is a huge problem for me. I don't have the patience for this OS. Also, It's kind&nbsp;of a cool new toy to begin with that quickly becomes
 annoying. Can I get a refund for 2 copies of Windows 7 instead of this Windows 8 or can Microsoft do an update to get rid of this start menu toggle. Or maybe have the ability to move the start menu toggle to any part of the screen as an Icon so it doesn't
 interfere with my other monitors being on the corner edge as it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am honestly blown away by Microsoft&nbsp;lack of operators choice here. Not like we have a choice of a OS for PC usage to begin with.&nbsp;</p>

            Latest news and business analysts point out how Microsoft has hurt itself with the Windows 8 redesign, and lack of consumer input to Windows 7 Start Menu and Desktop options/transition. I just advise my clients to avoid Windows 8 or plan to purchase a
 plug-in to revert to the Windows 7 interface. Most users don't bother and stick with Windows 7.

Desktop is nice.  Start8 really helps, but then you try to view a photo or PDF and you're back in metro ****.  Microsoft calls this a "modern UI," but they seem to forget  that modern computers are designed to do many, many things at once.  Why the heck would I want Video Playback  (yes defaults to the Metro Media Player) when I switch apps to check the last IM I was sent? 



I hope SP1 or Windows 9 fixes this problem.  That way my $3,000 computer can quit behaving like a danged cell phone!. 



The sad thing is the Win 8 desktop is really good, and you would never notice it until you got a Start button replacement.

            <p>Full screen programs are a waste of my desktop, I am not on a laptop. I need 10 programs open at any given time. I don't want to hack up Windows 8.1 with Start8. I never ever ever ever did I say ever want to see metro except on my phone. Its unproductive,
 hard to get any work done in this thing I keep trying to use Win 8.1 but give up and go back to 7 after 30mins or so. Its just very bad on the desktop if you are trying to work. This is the 1st OS from Microsoft I have not been all in on from the 1st beta.
 Maybe Windows 9 will get back to a real OS instead of a toy. Maybe its just time for a hackintosh?</p>

            Not only are fullscreen programs completely idiotic, also playing where is waldo trying to find your programs on a screen cluttered with distracting icons is inefficient.<br />
I don't want huge touchscreen friendly icons filling my screen. I use a desktop PC not a tablet or phone.<br />
Different devices demand different designs - and it makes no sense at all to blow up a UI designed for a tiny touch screen on a 20 inch desktop monitor.<br />

            <p>Upon the imminent demise of my old notebook, I raced out to purchase a new ultrabook, which was running Windows 8 and now 8.1.&nbsp;While this version of Windows OS provides developers some advantages in developing code that crosses multiple platforms, it is
 absolutely an impediment to my productivity on my ultrabook. It routinely entails extra steps when I want to open recently used files, when I want to save files locally, when I want to quickly display my list of frequently used or favorite programs. The Windows
 8.1 start button displays hard-to-read tiles;&nbsp;it certainly does not restore my former easy to use functionality.&nbsp; Even the display by name still involves grouping of various programs under a hierarchy that requires additional learning.&nbsp; It's hard to beat a
 text list sorted in alphabetical order. After installing Microsoft Office 2013, I was absolutely flabbergasted that a mail URL in a browser installed on my desktop would take me to the mail app within the Metro interface - an app that I had never set up&nbsp; nor
 was of interest to me.&nbsp;Did the fact that I had installed Outlook elude the Windows 8 designers. Saving a document takes me longer as I sort through whether I want to share or save in the cloud or just put it in My Documents (this phrase apparently now being
 somewhat obsolete). In Windows now&nbsp;user-friendly manner, somewhat akin to Apple, I often display lists that don't show the file type, meaning that I don't know if I am about to open up the Word version of a file or the PDF version. It takes me forever to remember
 how to turn off WiFi or Bluetooth; I used to have an icon on my desktop. While there are other points I could make, I suppose that I should try to figure out how to change the color themes in Office so that I can more readily read the otherwise bleached out
 fonts or see the gridlines in Excel when I am using my monitor. It's horrible to look at a spreadsheet and see only a white page with text scattered around it. Even darkening the gridlines doesn't cut it; the gridlines are just blurry.</p>

                    <p>I just received my second SP 2017 in the mail yesterday. The first one had a raised screen, this one has a buzzing noise that seems to be coming from the speakers. Even when I turn the speakers completely off I can hear it, so it may not even be the speakers.
 It's quite a disturbing noise, it kind of sounds like that sound when your ears are ringing. In a quiet room it's all you can hear and it drives me absolutely nuts. This is the i5 fanless model so I know it's not the fan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what I can do to get rid of it? I really don't want to have to return this thing AGAIN...</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you can still hear the noise even if you completely turn off the speaker volume, it is a possible hardware issue. However, we need to get additional information to find out what really is causing this. Please answer the questions
 below.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Does the issue occur as soon as you turn on the device?</li><li>Does the issue only occur when the power adapter is plugged in? </li><li>Have you checked if the issue also occur when a headphone or earphone is plugged in?<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>In the meantime, you can try installing the latest firmware update for your Surface device. You can download the firmware from this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
site</a>. <br />
<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Have the same problem - It appears when the update fails.&nbsp; Search of the KB reveals nothing as far as I can tell.&nbsp; My error says I need to remove the Dell Storage Manager Driver but doesn't tell me which specific filename or object to remove or where to

<p>I have the same issue, on a HP machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original KB article references an Adaptec Dell PERC 3 / Di RAID Controller issue on Windows 2008 (!)&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/941024/message-when-you-run-the-windows-server-2008-system-compatibility-repo</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP's forum contains a reference to this, but the response is along the lines of ''switch it off and on again'', and not particularly informed or helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Error-during-windows-10-1709-update/td-p/6462803</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, the error shown by the windows 10 update process also says I must remove ''VirusScan8", a product I don't have and never hand installed.&nbsp; I did have a McAfee product, removed it and rebooted - and still get the flag for ''VirusScan 8''.</p>

<p>Hi Gavin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that this is due to <span><span>corrupted system files.
</span></span><span><span>I suggest that you use the<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>System File Checker</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>tool to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. The<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>sfc</span><span>/</span><span>scannow</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>command
 (<strong>System File Check</strong>) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed or damaged versions with the correct versions possible. You may refer to this<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>link</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></a><span><span>for
 more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If the issue persists even after using System File Checker tool, please follow the steps below to run the DISM tool:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Press Windows key + X and select the Command Prompt (Admin).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, enter the following commands (Press the Enter key after each command):&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p><span><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /</span></span><span><span>Scanhealth</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and press Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Restart the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span> <br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart your device and run SFC once more just to make sure that everything clear.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>

<p>I had this problem yesterday (5/19/2018) and fixed it without a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is an HP, but it had copies of files from several older machines, including a couple of Dells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was to search for folders called "DELL' and check for driver folders under them. These I then deleted and emptied the recycle bin. After a couple of attempts, the update continued and installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: it's looking for a particular file somewhere in the filesystem: the driver does not have to be installed, merely present. It would be nice if the error message actually gave a filename.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem noted above.&nbsp; I have a HP machine that had prior versions of Windows from a Dell, although the driver in question is not installed and I've been unable to find it using DELL as a keyword.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even ran the DISM tool, which found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really would help if someone from MS could provide either the exact file name or at least a piece of it that I could use to search??</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Read this about PC Doctor:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-Doctor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-Doctor</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it may also be Malware:</p>
<p>Download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware, if necessary&nbsp;in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here is how to get into Safe Mode options; choose Safe Mode with Networking from the list of options:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not fix the problem, take it out of Startup, as it seems to have been uninstalled or removed, but left a Startup Entry still there..</p>
<p>Use either fo these two methods.</p>

<h3> cdunnett  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Sims 3 launcher won&#39;t open at all</h2>
                    I recently downloaded the WA expansion pack off of the EA website, but it crashed everytime I loaded the Sims. I un-installed and re-installed the Sims to see if that removed the glitch and now I can't even get onto the launcher.<br />
I have removed background programs, set it to open as admin, checked all drivers are up to date, my spec is more than the required and I have done a systems, disk and computer check. I am completely stumped as to why it won't work.<br />
Please help?

<p><span>Hi,<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows 7 Answers Forum!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you please tell us whether the game ever worked on your computer earlier?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First you need to perform compatibility check of any game with windows 7 on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To do that you need to follow the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also note that the game Microsoft Flight simulator is not compatible with Windows 7, to know more about that you may visit the below link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Microsoft Flight Simulator X Deluxe Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator%20X%20Deluxe%20Edition</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to install the game from the CD and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is not compatible then you need to install it in compatibility mode and check for the issue to do that you need to follow the steps provided below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Locate the installer.exe or setup.exe file in your file system and right-click on the file. From the contextual menu, choose Properties &gt; Compatibility. Choose the version
 of Windows you want to emulate and select the “Run this program in compatibility mode” checkbox. Run the installer</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you need further information on the above provided steps then you can follow the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<br />
Hi<br />
<br />
Open Control Panel / System. Select Advanced System Settings.<br />
<br />
In the Performance section, select the Settings Button.<br />
<br />
The 'Show window contents while dragging' is the option. Enable this setting to show the entire window and disable this setting to see the outline.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Bose Soundbar 500 Setup For Xbox Surround Sound</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">
Hello!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">
I'm trying to figure out the best set up between my TV, Xbox One X, and Bose Soundbar 500. I currently have the Xbox connected to the TV via HDMI. I have the soundbar connected to the TV into an HDMI ARC port in the TV. There is only one HDMI port on this soundbar.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">
The problem is I don't seem to be getting surround sound out of the Xbox. In the Xbox settings for HDMI audio it only allows me to select stereo uncompressed. Is it possible to get surround sound out of this soundbar using the HDMI ARC connection? Or do I need
 to use an optical cable somewhere along the way? Which Xbox audio settings should I be using?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 36, 36, 1)">

<p>Depending on your TV, the Audio Return Channel might not support surround sound from other inputs, like the other HDMI input from your Xbox. Most TVs only send multi-channel audio via ARC if the sound is produced in the TV's tuner, like Live TV, or attached
 media drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Bose Soundbar seemingly supports optical TOSLINK, your best option would be to add an optical cable between your Soundbar, and the optical output of your Xbox console.&nbsp;</p>
