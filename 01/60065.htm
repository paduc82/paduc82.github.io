<h2>            Need &#34;Everyone&#39;s Permission&#34; to delete file</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to delete a file on an external hard drive I use for backup. I get the message that I need Administrator's Permission (I am the administrator!). Next I get need "Everyone's Permission" to delete file. This has never happened before. My guess
 is that Microsoft has downloaded something that causes this. Everything I have read on the subject says to right click the file &gt; properties &gt; security tab- THERE IS NO SECURITY TAB. Does anyone have any ideas that might help. This is Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            If you connect the drive to another computer, can you delete the file?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Under General tab, choose Diagnostics startup.
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />Restart, then try deleting the file again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try restarting Explorer and make sure no file is open from the drive or the drive is not in use outside of browsing.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Processes tab
<br />Click Windows Explorer
<br />Click Restart
<br />Try deleting the file again.
<br />
<br />You can try deleteing from the command line.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type CD followed by the drive letter
<br />
<br />example: cd x:\
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />X represents the name of the drive letter
<br />
<br />Once you have navigated to where the folder is on the drive, type:
<br />
<br />At the command prompt type del (delete) followed by the file name. Example: del win10uichanges.pptx

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft is selfish</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,<br />
<br />
I really love Apple, it's amazing! They keep their operating system neat and organized. It is just clean and beautiful. I hate Windows.. It is full of confusing applications and files such as MSVCP100.dll. I mean, **** is that? And even more interesting, who
 was the idiot who decided to name it that way. That is selfish!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple in the other hand is not selfish, they name their products in a user-friendly way and they don't flood your computer with millions of useless files named: &nbsp;"234iywekrjh382e.dll", "sdlfi283uwierjf982.dll" and "sodif832d.exp". -- What kind of selfish
 idiot would name all the windows files like that?.. Users can't rely on those files when they have a problem in their computer and have to deal with them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** Windows and their selfish programmers. Windows is more selfish than insurance companies. It is almost impossible to contact Windows. Microsoft simply don't care about their costumers. Is there microsoft/widnows email for customer support..? I don't
 think so.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I came with a problem with my new windows 10 PC. I try to run a program and I get this error: "The program can't start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your computer". So, what the **** does that mean..!? I did some research and find out that I
 had to re-install that file/program whatever the f... it is. Problem: there is about 10,000 with that name in my pc. Again, Windows is a powerful OS but it's programmed by selfish egoistic idiots. It is ridiculous I can't run a regular application because
 of a problem of this area. It is just a complete joke.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Pablo</p>

<p>Hi Sumit, thanks fir your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sir I am 66 and disabled and of course I looked for the easiest way to try and fix this but I was not successful. &nbsp;I am not to bright in this area. I did not have another computer with win 10 pro to create a Media Creation Tool &nbsp;to boot my win 10 Pro desktop
 but I do have a windows 10 Pro Microsoft DVD which I tried to boot from. It copied the files and ask where to install the software . There were 4 partitions 3 created by windows with very small amount of data and then there is the primary partition. I got
 a message when I clicked on each partition "windows cannot be installed in this partition because the partition is of the GPT type so i could not install win 10 Pro and I am stuck again.</p>
<p>Further examination revealed that the primary partition was formatted or deleted because there was no used space on this drive.</p>
<p>I also want to add some additional info on how this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for updates for my win 10 Pro desktop and noticed a message suggesting that I upgrade &nbsp;to the latest version of win 10 pro of 1809 from 1703 as I had. I tried downloading the upgrade but &nbsp;it failed and i had to force shutdown using the power button.
 I restarted and saw the message ...no os found &nbsp;press any key to reboot but nothing worked.. I can enter BIOS etc but cannot install win 10 Pro. This is a genuine Win 10 Pro with a Digital License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need your help &nbsp;Sumit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</h2>
                    Hello, i recently uninstalled my graphics card drivers (for a very stupid reason). When i decided to re-install, my computer was unable to find my graphics card (Radeon HD7790). I thought, no biggie. I'll go into device manager and select it from there.
 I then noticed, there was no Radeon 7790 showing, just "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter". I have done hours of digging through the internet to find a solution, and i've had no luck. It's left me no choice but to post my questions here. Thanks for reading.&nbsp;

            Found a solution! I installed the vista version of the driver for my graphics card and the computer then recognized my graphics card and was able to get it working. Very bizarre. Hmmmm.. not compatible with win7 or 8? Says on the packaging that it's "Windows
 8 Ready".&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for trying to help, I followed the examples in the post by Babu V but no they didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not so much that edge crashes but like I said in my first post they never connect to the internet yet I know my connection is ok as I can connect with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome and and stay connected no problem at all, If i click on the internet
 icon it says i am connected and this is true for Chrome and IE but If I try to connect to the net with Edge it says Hmm we can't reach this page? it is as if my firewall is blocking access for everything windows 10 related but is ok for IE or Chrome but if
 I switch off the firewall then Edge still does not connect to the net?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

 Wi-Fi connection and try again". &nbsp;This message from Windows 10 is obviously a lie because I can use this same "Not connected" status to browse the internet with Google Chrome. &nbsp;Example, I am sending this comment using Google Chrome on the same internet connection
 that Windows 10 says does not exist.</p>
<p>What is really going on with Microsoft Edge? &nbsp;Granted that my internet connection speed is slow, but no connection is not the same thing as slow connection. &nbsp;Perhaps, Microsoft can tell users the minimum speed Microsoft Edge requires to connect to the internet.<br />

<p>I find it really amazing that as much as Microsoft is trying to unseat Google Chrome as the dominant browser, I continue to have this issue on a regular basis. &nbsp;I can easily, always, never-fail connect to the internet with Google Chrome but I constantly,
 regularly, typically, cannot connect to the internet with either Edge or Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this behavior happens, the two Microsoft browsers appear to be hung in some kind of start-up situation; i.e., the behavior is as if they haven't fully loaded or something. &nbsp;For example, clicking on the "Gear" icon in Internet Explorer, the menu that
 appears is mostly disabled in the same fashion it is when it is first starting up. &nbsp;On a Windows 7 system, Internet Explorer eventually "wakes-up" and the menu becomes fully accessible. &nbsp;On my Windows 10 system, when this issue occurs, neither Edge nor Internet
 Explorer ever wake-up and the menu continues to be only partially accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is all that data that Microsoft is trying to send back to the mother-ship which they collect from us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is Google Chrome works without fail. &nbsp;So guess which browser I will continue to use on Windows 10?</p>

            I am having exactly the same problems. Edge is extremely unreliable both on my notebook and on my pc. What a pity I cant just uninstall it and forget it. I am a MS fan but enough is enough.

<p>After researching similar issue for the past 5 days, I want to share my finding and solution.&nbsp; Before I continue, I want to recap the issues/symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>I had upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 in 2017 through Microsoft free upgrade program.&nbsp; Everything went smoothly when I first upgraded to Windows 10 (64 bit / Pro Version).&nbsp; In February of 2018, I decided to re-install Windows 10 because I was encountering
 some issue with USB devices connecting to Windows (not sure if this was related to the issue we are discussing here).&nbsp; Start menu and Cortana are also unresponsive (when I click on the Start icon, or when I click on the Cortana search, nothing would happen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a bootable USB drive using Media Creation Tool by Microsoft -&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation went smoothly, and the system was rebooted.&nbsp; After rebooting, the USB devices would connect to computer properly.&nbsp; But after trying to log in to Skype, an error popped up stating that I do not have internet connectivity.&nbsp; However, I do have
 internet connectivity since Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer all works.&nbsp; After some testing, I concluded that all services/programs that Windows has built-in (Windows Apps, such as Skype, Edge) could not connect to internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During troubleshooting, I discovered that the Network Status (access by going to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network &amp; Internet), shows that the "Network is not connected" (The Network icon that shows on the right of the Task Bar shows the computer IS Connected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried all the suggestion that this thread had stated, but none of them addressed the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>Here is what I did that resolved the issue.&nbsp; Very simple and quick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Network Status (access by going to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network &amp; Internet)</p>
<p>2. This page will show you the Network Status, and more options underneath it.</p>
<p>3. Select "Network Reset"</p>
<p>4. Follow the direction, then the computer will automatically restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Note sure how this is different from uninstalling and re-installing the network adapter driver. I had tried to roll-back, and update to the latest Network Adapter Driver to no success on multiple occasions based on the suggestion of numerous recommended
 fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once restarted, everything went back to normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this may help anyone that is also experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    <p>Original Title: Missing Word Twist App In start Menu and Tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed Word Twist from the Windows store some time ago.&nbsp; All was well for years and then suddenly the Word Twist App disappeared.&nbsp; I went to the Windows Store and checked My Apps and Word Twist is missing.&nbsp; When I go to the Word Twist
 App in the Windows Store&nbsp; the Word Twist App says it is installed.&nbsp; I now run the App from the Windows Store directly.&nbsp; Somehow I was able to pin Word Twist to the Task Bar and I am currently running it from there.&nbsp; It would seem a uninstall re install is
 in order but I can't uninstall what I can't find.&nbsp; This is the only app with this problem</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Bill,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Run built-in Windows Store app troubleshooter.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a. Click on Start search and&nbsp;type troubleshooting and choose 'Troubleshooting'</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b. Click on 'View All'.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c.&nbsp;Run the Windows Store apps troubleshooter.</span><span> (Right click on the built driver file.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d. </span><span>Click/tap on <strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong><span>. And check if it helps.</span></span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Clear the cache from Windows store</span></span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
This command resets the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps. It’s a system and hidden file. WSReset.exe is usually located in the %SYSTEM% folder.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the steps given below.<br />
<br />
a) Press "<strong><span>Windows</span></strong>+<strong><span>R</span></strong>" key on the keyboard to open Run window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
b) In the <strong><span>Run </span></strong>window type "<strong><span>wsreset</span></strong>.<strong><span>exe</span></strong>" and then click ok it will clear all the cache in Windows store</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest to try the steps provided in the link below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/cant-sign-in-local-account/0b195fad-e5f3-4226-ba62-36de07776cf8"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/<span>forum/windows_8-winapps/cant-sign-in-local-account/0b195fad-e5f3-4226-ba62-36de07776cf8</span></span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

            <p><strong>I had tried the Repair tool and the Win Store reset prior to Abdul's post.&nbsp; I applied the two methods again after getting the reply, but sadly the problem is still with me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the Word Twist shortcut and reenter it into the Start Menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you uninstall and reinstall a Windows Store app that the Windows Store Account (MY APPS) says is missing, but When you find the app in the store it says it is installed.&nbsp; The Store Account does not sync with the App in the Store itself.&nbsp; In other
 words if I find the App in the Store it says it is installed.&nbsp; <em><strong>If I look at the Start Menu or Metro Tiles I find nothing.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>What if I installed the Word Twist app from the vendors website?&nbsp; Would I have 2 instnaces of the same App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems with any other downloaded metro app. </p>
<p>

            <p>The issue was never resolved as a result of the aforementioned suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Start Tile and the ALL Apps Start menu entry for Word Twist magically reappeared after several weeks but not due to any action taken by me.&nbsp; However, in the Windows Store Account
 Word Twist app does not show up as a game that I own, even though it is installed and working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a mystery as yet not totally resolved but one that I am through fretting about.

<p>Hello Janis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded the MCT 10:45 A.M. PST. and the version is 16299.15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering whether you might have downloaded the MCT before they updated it to 16299.15?.&nbsp; Previously the MCT was 15063. but has now become 16299.15</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can determine the version of the MCT download by right clicking the download in file explorer and selecting "Properties"&nbsp; and then selecting "Details".&nbsp; This will reveal the Version number.&nbsp; You want 16299.15</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your download is the wrong version simply delete it, and redownload the current MCT.&nbsp; If you made installation media, wipe it, by formatting it within file explorer...right clicking the USB/DVD drive and selecting format.&nbsp; Format as FAT32</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Well i of course didn't stop at this error and went ahead and downloaded it again,</p>
<p>just to be sure, but it didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked up the version (freshly downloaded 1 minute ago)</p>
<p>and it is indeed the older version (10.0.15063.0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be extra sure, i downloaded it from the english site (en-us, instead of de-de)</p>
<p>but that didn't do the trick either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The direct link for the download is:<br />

<p>Yes, I'm confused as well.&nbsp; Both of the sites you reference appear legitimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hunch that the MCT might be detecting the version you are currently using and offering that.&nbsp; Are you using 15063.xxx currently... trying to make sense of why you are not being offered the 16299.15 download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to upgrade to 1709 Fall Creators Update?</p>

<p>It's running on Version 1703</p>
<p>-&gt; Build 15063 which is the same as the media tool</p>
<p>so i guess it's obvious...</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Widows Update, i'm on the newest Version, which made me think i actually am.</p>
<p>(Also updating today did, but hey, here we are)<br />

<h2>            How to eliminate &#34;There is not enough space...to copy&#34; dialog box when moving files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 on a new computer and have been having issues copy and moving files between drives. If I attempt to copy more files than there is free space on the destination drive, I simply get an error that states "There
 is not enough space on&nbsp;<em>drive</em>. You need an additional <em>xxx</em> GB to copy these files."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on every other installation of 8.1 that I have, if I attempt this, Windows will move as many files as will fit in the available free space, eventually prompting me, when it reaches a file that is too big, to either skip it or cancel the copy operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Keyboard Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin leeds uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Keyboard Settings</h2>
                    <p>Why has Microsoft set Windows 10 to the US keyboard by default despite stating in setup that it is a UK machine?</p>
<p>I have set up a Windows 10 machine all UK settings, hooked machine up to business server and the accounts have switched to US keyboard and date the wrong way round.&nbsp; I changed the settings back to UK and deleted the US settings but then when&nbsp;I log in with
 another account the US settings reappear???&nbsp; This happens every time a&nbsp;server account is opened on the machine.&nbsp; The server settings are UK.&nbsp; I nearly got locked out of an account due the password containing a symbol which was in a different place on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Could Microsoft explain this totally ludicrous situation, perhaps not explain just fix it?</p>

            Hi. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems, but I'm here to help. 
<br />
<br />This error is potentially caused by corrupt files. I would start by running the System File Checker to repair any potentially corrupt system files. You can find detailed instructions for doing so here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that solves the problem. If not, there are plenty of other things we can try! I'll keep working with you to resolve this issue.

 work.</p>

            I'm having this same exact problem when trying to view multiple photos that I just was able to open 2 days ago. Same file system error as above (-2147279796) Some kind of update broke something and I can no longer view pictures.

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu and Edge Browser no longer available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu and Edge Browser no longer available</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has been working perfectly fine for a month now.&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, after boot, Skype asked a question regarding calls and should the desktop app be used as a default.&nbsp;&nbsp; I answered OK and then received a windows message&nbsp;that the setting should be
 changed somewhere else ( Sorry I did not get exact wording here as this seemed benign ).&nbsp; I needed to reboot and when I did, I no longer&nbsp;have the start menu that will launch nor do I have the&nbsp;Edge browser on my toolbar and Cortana, while on the toolbar cannot
 be accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to the right click menu from start and run programs ( Word, Excel, etc..) I can get to control panel and Skype is running.&nbsp;&nbsp;My best guess is there is a permission that was hammered somewhere that is preventing Start, Edge and Cortana to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Spacing Issue in Context Menu Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ankurtandon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spacing Issue in Context Menu Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my Windows 10 on HP Stream 7 to Build 10586.29 and have noticed a weird issue with the context menu when i right click on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i right click for the first time after i restart, the context menu appears normally as it has always been appearing. But on subsequent right clicks, the size of the context menu is increased. It becomes longer than it usually used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me out with this issue? I have tried to change the Text size for menus in advanced display setting but it does not fix the issue.</p>

            <p>I am using mouse to right click. It displays correctly the first time but after that just messes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is creating a problem as when i right click on C:, the context menu is not completely displayed, instead small arrows appear at the bottom to scroll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was getting the mouse version of the menu with both kind of input methods (mouse and touch). It is with the new upgrade that this has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please suggest a way to always display the smaller version of the menu irrespective of which kind of input it is. I am using a 7'' tablet and with the larger menu, it is very frustrating to scroll again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you're getting the touch version your system is sending touch messages to that menu.&nbsp; There's no direct way to turn off the touch support on the menu side.&nbsp; You can probably turn off touch emulation in your ... touchpad / mousepad's options.&nbsp; I don't
 know where those would be on your system (it's a vendor-specific thing, IIRC), but most vendors recognize that their touch emulation can get in the way and thus have an option to turn it off.</p>

            <p>Just adding my request to make single line spacing an option on tablets when using touch instead of a mouse for 'right click' context menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from 8.1 to Windows 10 earlier this week on my 10.1" windows tablet and the double spacing forces me to use the arrows to see all the options. Since the touchscreen isn't the most accurate, I often have to do this several times to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not giving us an option is a 'bug' as far as I'm concerned. It should already be addressed in an update.</p>

<h2>            Flight simulator X, &#40;Gold edition&#41;,</h2>
                    Installed flight simulator X, (Gold edition), but can only play Demo, (on Vista). 1GB for Demo and and over 11GB for main program was installed. There is another disk called Flight Simulator Acceleration with its own product key that has not been installed.
 Demo is fine, but cannot access main program. Appreciate suggestions. The program creation seems to be 2006. Thanks<br />

            <p>Found the problem. On initial installation even though the product key was entered, only the Demo program came up. I removed the program and reinstalled it, but was not prompted for the product key. I used Widows Explorer to find the activation utility,
 re-entered the product key and now the demo and<u> main program are active.</u> For now I'm OK. Thanks for your quick reply!</p>

    <title>How to install another version of Visual C &#43;&#43; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to install another version of Visual C &#43;&#43;</h2>
                    I have multiple versions of VC because programs automatically download previous versions of VC during installations of the programs. However I am trying to download an older version of VC separately (2015 version is required by the program im trying to
 make work), however the installer wont install the 2015 VC because it says there is another version already installed. Yes, there are about 20 versions already installed spanning from 2007 to 2017... so... why won't it install another version? I checked and
 there is no other 2015 version...

<p>Another reason why the installation of the 2015 version fails is because the installer may still be seeing some files related to the version that you are trying to install. You can follow the steps below to resolve this issue.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I, to have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adjusting the brightness on my Surface does nothing to the image being routed to the adapter and then put through my projector and the image is about 2/3 the brightness I get when connected by regular HDMI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fixes planned for this? So far, I'm pretty disappointed with the Display adapter. I've had so many issues with it. The investment in the hardware and time to troubleshoot, fix, attempt connections, uninstall drivers, reinstall drivers, Microsoft updates
 break it...After finally getting it working again and have it be this dim is really disappointing.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. It's frustrating, because the image is remarkably dim. &nbsp;Connecting to that same projector via the display port makes for a much brighter image. Somehow the Display adapter is just hard-coded for a dimmer image. It doesn't make for
 good presentations.&nbsp;

<h2>            gaming fps drops and computer lag</h2>
                    <p>Hey I am currently running windows 7 home premium on my Compaq Presario cq5320f and I have 2gb of ddr3 ram and my processor is AMD Athlon II x2 240 and my previous power supply was 250 w&nbsp;I upgraded it to 600 w&nbsp;and I also put a&nbsp;GPU in it the PNY GTX 750 so
 my problem was that I was getting fps dips I don't know if its the ram causing this because their is only 2gb I play game like bf3 on med to ultra setting same happens of bf4 and I though if it could possibly be bottle necked by my&nbsp;GPU or if it is a ram problem
 because I am running windows 7 64 bit so I&nbsp; need some help on this, don't know if I should upgrade the ram to 4 gigs 8 gigs because this Compaq &nbsp;Presario only&nbsp; has 2 ddr3 ram slots.

            <p><em>"so I will get the fastest 4gb ddr3 ram I can get"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Get the same speed as what you already have. There are several reasons for this, but</p>
<p>first, is your motherboard's memory controller (or possibly the cpu's. I'm not sure if your cpu</p>
<p>is new enough to have the memory controller built in) cannot handle any speed RAM you whack into it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to force a speed more than one level higher than what the motherboard BIOS defaults to</p>
<p>(maybe not even that) you will very likely get BSOD's ( higher speeds can require over-clocking the system, and you really don't want to go there with this machine).</p>
<p>Second you will not see any real world difference, even if the machine can use a higher speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"trying to run windows and the game both at the same time"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, an unavoidable scenario, but do avoid multi-tasking (close browsers, etc.), and having too much stuff running in the background - eg. Disable unnecessary Starup programs via -
</p>
<p>System Configuration, ( msconfig &gt; Startup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"</em><em>and really the game runs fine at 50 fps...and the game&nbsp;spikes&nbsp;like 10 fps down every 10 sec&nbsp;so"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A 10 fps drop should not be serious. Doping below 25fps could cause serious lag though.<br />
I can't offer suggestions as to what RAM your system can run on stably. Compaq support may help.</p>
<p>Or go with a new 4GB kit of the same brand, speed, latency, and voltage as what you already have.</p>
<p>
