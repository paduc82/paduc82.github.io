<h2>            Driver problem with Trekstor Surf Tab Twin 10.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>I bought the Trekstor Surf Tab Twin about a year ago and before today I haven't got any sort of problem . It's an excellent 2 in 1 Pc with win 10 . But today when I turned it on I noticed that my keyboard didn't work properly so I tried to restart the pc
 , launch a diagnostic , restart from management list the keyboard and I also tried to reinstall the drivers from 0 but nothing could solve the problem. The error that windows give to me is "requested device descriptor failed" code 43.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to check if it was a physical problem trying to connect directly my keyboard to an other computer with an usb cable and it worked so i started to think that there is a problem with Windows ... How can i solve it ??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any solution .</p>

<h2>            Xbox&#39;s Enforcement Team Has Failed</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that it doesn't matter, and that the odds are no one reading this will be able to do anything, but since I can't file a Case Review (even though my communication ban is apparently greater then 24 hours), I'm going to post my thoughts here and wash my hands of the whole ordeal. So, here I go.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I've been playing Dark Souls 3 for a few months now. It's been a blast up until recently. To me, the best part was invading (my charactr name was "Jon von Addams" by the way; perhaps I invaded you 😆). I enjoyed invading someone elses world as an invisible archer/sniper and waging my own little wars&nbsp;of attrition. Granted, after doing over 1,000 invasions (a little of 600 of which were successful),&nbsp;you're bound to annoy a few people. People wrote all sorts of insults, lame excuses, and the like. I even had multiple people rage quit on me. I found it all hilarious.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, wanting to have a fun time and

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;P.P.S. It's obvious that the ban is longer than 24 hours, as I'm still banned. My account still states I'm in good standing and there are no offenses shown. So I'm being punished and I'm not even entitled to a Case Review, even though my ban is greater than 24 hours? Like I've already stated, if using the words "bitch" and "shove it" against a troll is going to get me banned, so be it. I can deal with that. But if the Enforcement &nbsp;Team isn't going to punish the troll, who used a homophobic remark, delighted in his attempts at annoying me, and used the acronym "LMAO" (which contains the word "ass"), why punish me?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Accountability is very important. And it seems the Xbox Enforcement Team is having some accountability issues.</p>

            <p>P.S. It's obvious this person is&nbsp;abusing the system. They&nbsp;only reported me because my tactics within the game were annoying to them. Who else have they&nbsp;done this to and the Xbox Enforcement Team has banned? MicroSoft, we're paying for these services from you, and it's apparent your system of dealing with these situations isn't working. I can see why my friends and others have been switching to Sony.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Outlook hidden emails in folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aer23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook hidden emails in folder</h2>
                    <p>I set up new files folders and dragged several emails to the folders in Outlook. The folder show a blue
<strong>5</strong> as the 5 unread emails. When i click on the folder to access emails a message reads; We didn't find anything to show here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I access my 'hidden' emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>How did you drag email? Outlook.com gives you one and only one set of folders. You can't set up new folder sets.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Outlook App on laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up folders on the left hand side and have on many occasions dragged emails over to the folders. All other folders show the dragged emails but not the ones I set up yesterday.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            At long last, I found a solution to this! I've been having this same BSOD ever since I updated to Windows 8 (from Vista). So posting a solution for the Google searchers. To fix this, I installed the latest Intel Rapid Storage Technology RAID driver from
 intel.com. Just google for "intel rapid storage technology driver" and click through the links to find the appropriate download. Don't let the name mislead you, the driver works regardless of whether you've got raid enabled.<br />

<p>I have both these files on my sky drive and you can download each and install in the following folders:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if asked to overwrite say yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a specific program is cited in error message, uninstalling and reinstalling the program specified will normally fix these errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. you should also ensure your system is clean:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><font><font color="#000000"><font>Download, install, update and do full scan with these free malware detection programs:</font></font></font></u></b></p>

<p>Hey everybody, i could really use some help here, this thing is driving me nuts...</p>
<p>A while back i purchased the Turtles Re-Shelled Arcade Game and everything went fine, since then i´ve erased it and downloaded it again more than once. Today i did the same, and while i was playing the Duke Nukem Forever demo the "Download Complete" pop
 up appeared on screen and it´s been doing it ever since, it pops up, ends its animation, then it pops up again!</p>
<p>Now i´ve tried everything, from erasing the game, playing it, even canceling the download but that &nbsp;just freezes my Xbox or gives me the "can´t retrieve information from Xbox Live, Please try again later &nbsp; &nbsp; Status Code:80150101"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anybody explain this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 AMD laptop boot up with blank screen for ages&#33; Also runs VERY slow after startup and i dont know what to do.....if your reading this HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>look.. my laptop is a Compaq CQ58 Windows 8.1, from around Monday I was just about to play Asphalt 8, so I went onto the start screen and what dya know,, Freeze!! My laptop was non- responsive so like any normal person I shut it down by pressing the power
 button. I reboot it up and it just stayed on a blank dark screen, so I turned it off again and took the battery out and left for 5mins then started it up again? at that point I didn't think anything was wrong. so anyways I did this for about 1 hour and nothing,
 so I decided leave the battery out for the whole night and ill come back to it in the morning &nbsp;and see what happens..
</p>
<p>Morning..</p>
<p>I wake up put the battery in and boot it up same thing?? Anyways some luck appears .. After about 7-10 mins the C logo comes up as normally and takes another 15mins to boot up. Finally the lockscreen comes up but is totally unresponsive for around 5mins
 then I log on. </p>
<p>At first It was quite slower and crashed often when I loaded something up...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyways common sense would tell you to scan the laptop for stupid viruses and stuff. I did everything.. i wont go into too much detail coz it could crash right now. its Thursday and it been okayish.. I went onto command prompt and did a sfc scan and it
 did find some corrupt files but that how far i got. I also install some antirootkit software(Sophos, others too cant remember) but no luck I uninstalled them and tried searching for some corrupt DLL files. now the funny thing is.. is that on my task manager
 a host process called "rundll.32 " was running (please don't tell me what it is I already know) so I stopped it and I kinda did make a diffrence. it doesn't &nbsp;crash now and the whole system seems alright
</p>
<p>BUT... im still stuck with the same problem with the boot and also the shut down,, its like it will take Forever to do so it shut it down manually. I really cant live with that
</p>
<p>At this point i don't know what to do now my school holidays are now over and i don't want to have a broken laptop. im NOT sue if its either&nbsp;a hardware problem of mother board problem coz my laptop does get hot sometimes. please give some advice for what
 I should do next coz </p>
<p>i don't want to leave it too late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Btw my laptop hasn't identiy any probs only th sfc scan and that's it If you want to see the cbs logs tell me if it helps. im not very comtable with reinstalling windows coz I know it wont work so that's not an option
</p>
<p>UPDATE 29/08/2014</p>
<p>laptop booting slow AGAIN and when i go to task manager it shows the disk space at 100% and i scroll down and nothing is using it&nbsp; WHAT COULD IT BE? this isn't normal....</p>

<p>You could use WPT's WPRUI for its boot tracing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds like a textbook case for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

</p><p>Which virus software do you have? Unplug or turn off wireless networks and see how it boots. I would run windows defender offline scan. It boots for a cd DVD or use drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have recovery media or a recovery drive see if it boot into that slowly, too. The external media would be better.

<p>
</p><p>Update your graphics driver. If that doesn't work disable your graphics adapters so that it uses the basic display driver</p>

            The only thing know of that does that during boot is chkdsk and a missing drive. A hang can be caused by a corrupt drive. Keep an eye out for disk errors. Look in event viewer to see what chkdsk infi is logged and be extra vigilante about keeping a backup
 if data just in case. Good to hear it worked

For best results:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Backup all your data (documents, pictures, music, text files, databases, bookmarks/Internet favorites, installation executables, product keys, emails, contacts, etc.) to external media.&nbsp; (External media is something like an external hard drive, network drive,
 CD and/or DVD, etc.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Figure out what hardware you have and locate (via their web page) the latest version of the hardware device drivers for each component in your computer (motherboard, video, audio, network, etc.) and download those and save them to external media.&nbsp; (External
 media is something like an external hard drive, network drive, CD and/or DVD, etc.)&nbsp; Don't forget any external hardware like printers, scanners, etc.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Make sure you have all your installation media for all of your utilized applications and operating system stored in a safe/external to the computer completely place.&nbsp; Also make sure you have the product keys/serial numbers for any purchased software easily
 available for installation.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Format the system and install from scratch.&nbsp; You can do this utilizing any internal mechanism provided by the system manufacturer (Dell, HP, Gateway, Lenovo, etc.) to restore/recover the system to factory defaults.&nbsp; Otherwise, use the Windows 7 DVD or USB boot
 media to start the computer, erase the partitions, create new partitions and install cleanly using your product key.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Install all the hardware drivers you got earlier - that should allow your operating system to communicate with your hardware in an efficient manner.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Update Windows 7 via the built-in update feature.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Install all of your software using the media you stored off the computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Update everything (Windows 7, installed applications, etc.) completely.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Make sure you perform the normal maintenance tasks like disk defragmentation, checking the disks for errors periodically, keeping your antivirus software up to date, keeping the Windows and other application patches current, etc.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Beyond that, anything else is just for when *you* mess something up and/or allow something to get messed up (could be unintentional, viruses and malware can take advantage of holes you did not know existed - but in a well protected system that is also well
 maintained and has a careful user - this is minimized.)&nbsp; Make consistent backups on a schedule to external media and test them when you can.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In other words - unless you already have a problem, cleanup is unnecessary.&nbsp; Yes - badly programmed applications can leave their marks in the registry and some even leave files behind - but their impact on your performance is minimal if existent at all.&nbsp; Most
 system tweaks will do little for your daily performance and are meant for more specific things (like if you utilize your network in a certain way or make graphically heavy applications or record music, etc.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What you are trying to 'tweak for' would be good information to give.&nbsp; Improving overall system performance is usually a moot point if best practices were followed from the start.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you really insist on trying to not start from a good point and follow the best practices to make sure you don't need to cleanup (or cannot do this for whatever reason...)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p>Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>. Remove whatever is found.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<br />
<p><strong><u>Free up some hard drive space and get it organized:</u></strong></p>
<p>Open an elevated command prompt by clicking on the start orb and browsing through All Programs --&gt; Accessories and right-clicking on "Command Prompt" and choosing "Run as Administrator".<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Type in the following in the command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>
<p>... and press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>The process takes a few minutes to complete, it ends with the sentences “Service Pack Cleanup operation completed. The operation completed successfully”.<br />

schedule this regularly</a>.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>

Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used. Then you can determine what to do and what to delete/archive.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and arrange everything for more efficient access...<br />

 the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.<br />

<p><br />
For Cleanup: You don't need anything that doesn't come with Windows, but if you want to use CCleaner, it's fine, as long as you don't use its registry cleaning functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Registry fixes, *Nothing*. </p>
<div>
<div><font><span>Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think,
 and what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Read http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000643.html</span><br />
<span>and http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</span><br />

<div>You also might want to read the section on the CCleaner Registry Cleaner here:</div>
<div>http://www.howtogeek.com/113382/how-to-use-ccleaner-like-a-pro-9-tips-tricks/<br />
<br />
<font><span>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from the market
 almost immediately. Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font><span>For Uninstall: Just uninstall from the Control Panel.</span></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font><span>For System Tweaks: Again, nothing. All these programs are more likely to hurt you than help you.</span></font></div>

Read my previous reply and that of others.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What you need to do is all in there.&nbsp; Specific questions can be asked about specific problems - but there is no "one-stop fix-it-all" software out there to tweak your system.&nbsp; No matter what you see advertised.<br />

                    I'm getting electric shocked where my wrist makes contact to the left bottom corner of the surface laptop. The only way I don't get shocked is if i'm wearing a long sleeved shirt or a jumper. To put it simply if I make contact with the bottom left side
 of the laptop for longer than 10 seconds I get shocked. What should I do to fix this

    <title>Program too big to fit in memory - Microsoft Office 2007 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tankedthomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program too big to fit in memory - Microsoft Office 2007 Professional - MS Word</h2>
                    Recently, my Microsoft Office Word stopped functioning. It is the 2007 version, that came bundled with MS Office 2007 Professional edition. I did buy it in a store, so it is all legitimate, so that is not a problem. However, I have never had a problem
 like this up until now. When I try to run Microsoft Word, I get a command prompt window flash at me, and by taking a few guesses, and trying to screenshot it, I managed to see that it said "Program too big to fit in memory", and that means, no more Microsoft
 Word.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The last thing I want to do is reinstall the whole suite, so I've tried a few things, but none that have got many any further to a solution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First of all, I checked all the other Office programs to see if it was a problem with the whole lot, but that does not seem to be the case. Word is the only one with that problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next, I tried looking for the same problem on the internet. Well, I've found it, but with completely different programs, and the causes and solutions seem to be totally different - there's nothing that could be used to fix MS Word.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I had no luck with that, I just started ending services that weren't need to let my computer run that were taking up memory (even if it was a tiny bit). Still, no luck. Side note here: I don't know if the error message is actually accurate in what
 it says. I closed every program I had running, and as many services as I could safely end, but it still didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to install Office 2007 Service Pack 2, but it was already installed. Just a side note - I think this could be the cause of the malfunction, but I'm not sure, and I don't know if it would be safe to uninstall it, then reinstall it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally, I tried the last resort of contacting Microsoft. I get to their support page, I find the contact link, I choose my product (Microsoft Office 2007 Professional), and.... I think
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/oas/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the link it took me to</a> sums it all up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As for my operating system, I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit edition. I have 1GB RAM (pathetic, I know, but I bought my laptop back in March '06, and don't have the money to upgrade it at present), and a dual-core on 1.73gHz each.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That's pretty much all the information I can give, so if someone could help me fix this (preferably without reinstalling the suite), I'd really appreciate it.</div>

            Ok, I'll try that, although I have to say, albeit being a bit slow, my computer runs fine on 1GB RAM, and I've been running Office 2007 for just about two years now (if it was released in 2006, it could be closer to 3 instead, I can't remember), without
 a problem, might I add. It just loads slowly, but it's okay, and I'll be in the market for a RAM upgrade early next year (unfortunately, a computer upgrade isn't likely at this point in time).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, I do think it is corrupt; I just find it weird that it seems to have happened after Service Pack 2 was installed, although I can't be 100% sure if it happened straight away or not (but I think it did), so I thought if I perhaps reinstalled that,
 it might fix the problem. I will try reinstalling just Word, though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>UPDATE: I fixed it by doing a repair through Add/Remove programs. I guess I should have thought of that earlier.</div>

<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft Support tried and failed, he suggested that I download the Media Creation Tool, which I did. He then said to "Upgrade Now" and "Keep My Files". all of which I did. Once complete I had the same version I started out with!</p>

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I read the final suggestion (that I <em>WAS</em> up to date) and I realized that Windows updates were flying in faster than UFOs over Roswell, New Mexico, I decided that I couldn't be up to date and something was preventing the installation of new updates.</p>
<p>So, I decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 and that did the trick. Instantly, (well, not exactly instantly, but...) the system was up to 586!</p>
<p>Therefore, while I don't think a clean install is (was) the answer, it certainly solved the problem, something no one else seemed to be able to do!!</p>

<h2>            Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 compatibility with Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an Asus X series laptop which came with Windows 8 and Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless adapter and driver installed. It worked perfectly for the last year. I have now upgraded(?!) to Windows 10 and it now won't connect with the Internet. My attempts
 to diagnose the problem suggest that there is a problem with the adapter and/or its driver. Luckily my PC, on which I am writing this, is still working, but obviously I cannot now use the laptop to download new driver software. How do I resolve this problem
 please?

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description I understand the issue might due to the incompatible drivers. Try to download the latest compatible drivers on your PC and use any external Storage device to transfer and install them on your Laptop.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know if problem still persist, we're glad to assist you. Hope this will address your query.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Downloading the patches seems to have worked well for me (have not tried adjusting photos yet), but note:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; I had to locate them via copying the link listed.&nbsp; Going through Corel's website, I could not find them for anything earlier than X4.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I still would not work until I restarted the computer and/or unchecked the "Run this program in compatibility for ... (Windows 7)" box which I had previously checked in trying unsuccessfully to get it to work.</p>

            <p>I had to run the patches using RMB (Right Mouse Button) --&gt; "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not run the DXSETUP.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed PSPP X3 from the CD.&nbsp; Rebooted.&nbsp;PSPP X3 crashed.</li><li>Tried Compatibility Mode with Win7. PSPP X3 crashed.</li><li>Started PSPP X3 as administrator.&nbsp; PSPP X3 crashed.</li><li>Found this thread.
<ul>
<li>Downloaded 5 patches using Chrome as Edge would not FTP.</li><li>Ran&nbsp;Patch1.&nbsp; Successfully installed.</li><li>Ran Patch2.&nbsp; File access error.</li><li>Ran Patch2&nbsp;using RMB--&gt;"Run as&nbsp;administrator". Successfully installed.</li><li>Ran Patch3&nbsp;using RMB--&gt;"Run as&nbsp;administrator". Successfully installed.</li><li>Ran Patch4&nbsp;using RMB--&gt;"Run as&nbsp;administrator".

<p>Thanks for the pointer to the FTP site, as the Web support page only goes back to X4 as of the start of 2017.</p>

            <p>You need to install five patches after installing PSPPX3 - do it from here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ignore desktop shortcut of PSPPX3 (and delete it - create a new one later), and then start PSPPX3 directly from START menu.</p>
<p>It works well on my both to Windows10 upgraded PC.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Product Key Windows 7 ultimate</h2>
                    Hi Y'all, &nbsp;I've got a unique situation. I have a laptop and it HAD windows Vista on it and I have the COA for that and the License Key, but I upgraded to windows 7 ultimate and wiped out the vista (it was a full version disk) Now I don't have the COA or
 Lic# for the 7 ultimate. How can I obtain a legit one? Being I had a authentic copy of vista, I feel I shouldn't have to pay full price for a complete new version, especially because it's kinda old now, but I like it and want to stick with it. How and where
 do i get one?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 does not come for free or for a discounted price because you had Vista; you have to buy it as everyone else does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was that free offer years ago; long expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(78, 176, 233, 1)">How does the Windows 7 Upgrade Option work?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Windows 7 Upgrade Option is available through participating PC manufacturers on selected PCs and through Microsoft on qualifying purchases of the Windows Vista packaged product. The Windows 7 Upgrade Option applies to Windows
 Vista Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate editions. Your Windows 7 upgrade will be to the comparable version: so you'll get either Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional (the upgrade to Windows Vista Business), or Windows 7 Ultimate, respectively.
 The Windows 7 Upgrade Option program runs from June 26, 2009 <strong>through January 31, 2010.</strong> Some Manufacturers may choose to shorten the Upgrade Option time frame.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend going back to Windows Vista, since thats no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>question, what is currently installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 7 Ultimate is still installed, you could try retrieving the product key for Windows 7 Ultimate, if its still installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are four utilities, all of which will may display your product keys if they are still there:
<br />
Belarc Advisor: http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html <br />
(It does a good job of providing a wealth of information.) <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also: http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder.shtml <br />
and: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html <br />
and RockXP: http://www.majorgeeks.com/download4138.html which has additional features
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to find the product key, you can then download and create a bootable copy:</p>
<p>
<span><span>Download Windows 10, 8, 7 ISOs</span></span></p>
<p>

</p><p>You can then create a bootable copy using the instructions in the following article:</p>

<p>Well, Bill,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; How many times do I have to purchase windows, like everyone else? Windows 3.1, Windows 98 2nd edition, Millenium, Vista upgrade? XP? I mean really, how many times? At what point do you get the windows merit badge or get acknowledged for in part buying
 one of your summer homes? Like everyone else has. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your reply sounded so arrogant, I couldn't help myself. I'm quite sick of buying Microsoft products to be honest with you, but I was seriously wanting to make my copy legit, that's all. I "bought" or acquired the disk(s), I just need a valid product
 key. The one on my home tower got damaged and is no longer readable aside from the laptop I spoke of initially. Are the people that sell product keys on ebay legit? Or are they just spitting them out of a key generator? I just want to take the right course
 of action without having to sheli out ANOTHER $200 or $300 only find you no longer support that product. I don't like windows 10 and won't use it. Free or otherwise. I think Linux might be the answer to this problem. What do you think?</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thank you Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your information was most helpful, but unfortunately, I never had the product key for this windows 7 ultimate, it is a re-install disc that I purchased on eBay. I didn't realize it didn't come with a key. I'm wondering if the people on eBay selling
 them with a defunct computer or part are product keys that were never registered. It was my understanding that Product keys, COA's and the likes are not transferable. That would include not resell-able, right? How do they get around this? Are they licensed
 Microsoft re-salers? or dealers? Or are they just not legit? How does one tell one from another? Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Don't buy a Windows 7 Product Key by itself; buy the complete sealed package (DVD/License)</p>

<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>

<p>Auction websites like eBay are notorious for selling non-genuine licenses, so you were likely a victim.</p>

<p><span><span><span>- Doesn't

<p><span><span><span>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>OEM System Builder version:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.&nbsp;</span></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, your best course of action if you want to stick with Windows 7 is to purchase an OEM system builder license or consider switching to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This
 means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Edge Chromium, the Reading List - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Edge Chromium, the Reading List</h2>
                    <p>on the Edge feedback forum at</p>
<p>I have posed the following question in response to an existing thread</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>I wanted to ask this more pointed question:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>　</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the mooted "offline" Reading List feature that was included in Edge HTML but never fully activated be added to Edge Chromium?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I did get one reply to a question I posed, I think back in 2015,on the promised offline capability that reply said simply and unequivocably</p>
<p>
</p><p>""At this time, the reading list is not available offline in Microsoft Edge, but we’re working on it for a future update"</p>
<p>
</p><p>　</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion it is a pretty useless add on anyway. because in EdgeHTML it does nothing that adding a URL to the Favorites list already does and now tht Edge Chromium sensibly includes an Internet Exploder like facility to Save a webpage complete you can
 save the whole webpage for off line viewing i.e.reading anyway</p>

</p><p>Many thanks Sumit for your prompt and relevant response. Actually this is a case of &nbsp;my bad, because I had omitted to go back and&nbsp;&nbsp;complete&nbsp;the first line of opening post it should have said&nbsp;:-</p>
<p>on the Edge feedback forum at</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Discussions/Reading-list/m-p/414287#M364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Discussions/Reading-list/m-p/414287#M364</span></span></a></p>
<p>I have posed the following question in response to an existing thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in fact surprised to find the separate Edge feedback page having become deeply involved with another thread on this forum, that&nbsp; appears to be the primary Windows Community forum, a long (418 replies)thread about saving web pages due to Edge HTML's
 disgusting lack of functionality that thread was started soon after the original release of Window 10 and in almost 4 years has never had a proper response from Microsoft despite the 418 replies so far that sorry thread is at:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/forum/all/how-to-save-web-page-in-edge-browser/6c6f4095-f62e-48e8-8512-3fb47f981f88?page=21">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/forum/all/how-to-save-web-page-in-edge-browser/6c6f4095-f62e-48e8-8512-3fb47f981f88?page=21</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had simply copied my reply to make it appear in the Main forum It's Microsoft's fault for confusing things by starting in December a separate Edge Chromium forum.</p>

<p>I have neglected to keep an eye on this thread for a while and have&nbsp; only today found that the&nbsp; some erk (jerk/idiot) has summarily 'locked" i.e. virtually closed the vital 418 reply thread entitled&nbsp; "How to save Web Page in Edge Browser"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;wherein many highly concerned users have questioned Edge's dis-functionality in its original (HTML) form</p>
<p>Why&nbsp; on earth was that thread closed before anybody at Microsoft with any sense had tried to answer it properly I had more observations to make regarding the effect of Edge Chromium on that subject now I cannot say anything more there so am going to say
 things&nbsp; on this still open thread&nbsp;</p>
<p>oor is it "locked" mainly to force people to use the Edge feedback link in Edge itself if so it would have been nice an very helpful to have mentioned that instead of a bald inexplicable "locked" statement!!!</p>
