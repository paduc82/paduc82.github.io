<h2>            HDMI won&#39;t work in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I bought an 'All In One' with the discription of...<br />
LENOVO A540 All-In-One PC Windows 10! i5! /1TB Hybryd HDD! / MULTI-TOUCH Screen!</p>
<p>And i was told to do a full factory restore to solve the problem of my hdmi not working. When I connected it to the 55" TV, the A540 PC went into 'Shut Down' mode and turned itself off, but there was no response from the TV.</p>
<p>Not being 'techi' minded I took the easy option and took it to PC World who said they installed all new drivers and wanted to send it away but I took it home and tried it myself instead. It was just the same, so I updated Windows and sent away for a 'Lenovo'
 HDMI cable {about £8} and plugged it in and the PC screen went black but after a few second's it came back on but the TV still didn't respond,so I thought, well at least the PC work's now,so I started to try a few thing's with the cable plugged in. It didn't
 show up on 'installed devices', so I tried a 'hardware scan'. It gave it a 'Pass' overall but the Diagnostic's showed..."Chipset test"-failed and "PCI/PCI-e test"- failed, but the "USB test"-passed. After a short while though it changed the failed ones to
 'Invalid'. {can't remember which scan I used now}.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had similar problem's?</p>
<p>Thank's in advance.</p>
<p>Paul.</p>

<h2>            Modern Warfare 3..</h2>
                    ..Is exactly the same as Modern Warfare 2. If you care about gaming as a whole at all, do not buy it. Stop showing Activision that they can release another expansion pack for COD4, and charge you 60 dollars and get away with it. Seriously people, get some
 sense. There's MUCH more games coming out this year that isn't Call of Duty, and I'm not taking about Battlefield 3. Consider this, before continuing to, yet again, contribute to the death of gaming.

[/quote]Wow.&nbsp; First off when you take into account that only 13% of gamers are boys 17 or younger and that 37 is the average age of gamers(thanks to ADrunkCanadians post in another thread), one could assume that CoD is played by more adults than kiddies.&nbsp; Secondly
 CoD dieing will change NOTHING in the way the industry works.&nbsp; They will continue to "dumb down" or "casualize" games to get more sales.&nbsp; Take the game series you get your gt from.&nbsp; CoD had nothing to do with the "casualization" of the sequal.&nbsp; They just wanted
 more sales.&nbsp; This isn't anything new.

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Wow....just wow. I've cared about gaming since I was at least 3. And still, I'm getting MW3. I love the story behind the Modern Warfare games and people like you are not going to stop me from playing MW games. Sure, I love other series too. Halo being my
 favorite FPS series and Elder Scrolls being my favorite RPG. I'm anticipating many games this year, Halo: CE Anniversary, MW3, Skyrim, GoW3, AC: Revelations. All of these which are vast and different in many many ways. Just because you think that MW3 is the
 same thing is MW2 doesn't mean other people will think the same. Seriously dude, you get some sense. Also, CoD isn't going to be the death of gaming. Sure, CoD isn't the same as gaming used to be but CoD has pulled more people into the world of gaming than
 ever before. So to end this, please keep your rants to yourself, thank you.</p>

            <div>Which codecs did you install so that mkv files play natively inside Windows</div>
<div>Media Player? try a trick of renaming the mkv to wmp. You may not ever get this</div>
<div>to work. Take a look at</div>
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpromedia/thread/c9390c49-03bf-49f8-8ad0-4d1b761ab8ab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpromedia/thread/c9390c49-03bf-49f8-8ad0-4d1b761ab8ab/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Basically, the mkv file has to be transcoded on the fly between the computer and</div>

            Hi RaymondKelly1, i hope you're doin good today.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Check configuration in Skype
<br />
<br />Normally, you will receive the message about recording device error, if the microphone or the webcam is not configured properly in Skype.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />To check configuration:
<br />
<br />Open Skype and navigate to tools
<br />Click options and check for sound device.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Step 2: Verify in the recording tab if the Microphone is enabled and working.
<br />
<br />To check:
<br />
<br />Click Start, click Control Panel
<br />Click Soundand click Audio.

    <title>How can I do a system restore without access to my Start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elleanon  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I do a system restore without access to my Start menu</h2>
                    
<p>I somehow downloaded a virus - suspicious mystic, my anti virus tells me, and some other backdoor trojan.</p>
<p>My norton anti-virus keeps blocking them, and they keep attacking. I need desperately to restore my computer or reformat it. I have two anti-spyware/mal-ware programs too, and they claim they detect and quarantine the problems, and yet my AV continues to
 be triggered.</p>
<p>The problem is that as a consequence of the viruses, I no longer have access to my Task Bar, nor to my desktop options. Everything I do has to be done through Task Manager. The same applies in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>I can't access system restore through traditional means, and since I have a Netbook, I don't have an XP CD, nor do I have a CD drive, so I can't just format and reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked up several fixes online, but all require access to files that I do not have, like explorer.exe and rstrui.exe. I have not been able to implement any of the fixes I found online.</p>
<p>i have no files that need to be saved desperately - so if someone can show me a way, aSAP, to fix my computer I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>As I have said, I have tried many things, but at this point, I think my only option is to somehow restore my computer to its original settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I found a way to access System Restore, but it seems that I no longer have restore points from before the moment of the infection. Is there no way to restore to default settings when I first got the computer last year??</p>

<div>You'd need to read the manufacturer's instructions for that - and back up your data first, as it will be wiped during the process.</div>

            Hey do one thing first backup your file and download the avira live cd from avira website and boot from the cd to clean the virus,Because the virus is running once windows opens but not at booting time so this is the only way you can delete and save your
 os.any doubt reply me<br />

            thanks for your responses. It appears that i am screwed as I now get "fatal system error" when it tries to boot windows. I think I may have been backdoored and someone may have removed important components. I am going to take it in to get the Windows OS
 reinstalled. Luckily i don't have anything important on the drive.

<p>Wherever you take it in, get them to make you (or teach you how to make) a method to boot your system when you have problems sometimes in the future.</p>
<p>Either a bootable USB thumb drive or an external USB CD drive where you can boot the XP Recovery Console then you can fix these annoyances.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span>DOES NO ONE READ THE MICROSOFT DOCUMENTATION THAT COMES WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM??? ONCE XP IS INSTALLED, THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS ACTIVATE IT. THE SECOND THING YOU DO IS GO TO THE START MENU, APPLICATIONS,
 SYSTEM TOOLS, AND SYSTEM RESTORE-AND CREATE A RESTORE POINT! PICK A NAME FOR THE RESTORE POINT THAT IS EASILY RECOGNIZED...SAY, FRESH XP INSTALL! AND WHAT'S THE THIRD THING TO DO???</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WITH THE XPCD IN THE DRIVE, IF THE WELCOME TO WINDOWS SCREEN DOES NOT APPEAR, DOUBLE CLICK ON THE DRIVE IN MY COMPUTER AND CHOOSE "BROWSE THIS CD OR INSTALL OTHER FEATURES" AND CLOSE THE WINDOWS. (THIS WILL LET SET-UP UNDERSTAND YOU DO NOT WISH TO RE-INSTALL
 XP!) NOW, AT THE START MENU,&nbsp; THE RUN COMMAND, TYPE (WITHOUT THE QUOTATION MARKS) " D:\I386\WINNT32.EXE /CMDCONS" and press enter. VIOLA!!! SETUP WILL BEGIN WITH A COUPLE OF SEMI-MISLEADING POPUP SCREENS ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR DISKS AND SUCH, THEN ASK YOU
 IF YOU WISH TO INSTALL THE COMMAND CONSOLE AS A START-UP OPTION...CHOOSE YES, (c'mon, do it !!!) and after the screen about the console using a whopping 7mb of drive space, it will popup one last window about the recovery console being successfully installed
 and using it to boot a system when xp doesn't want to start. after a restart, it will be listed as one of your startup options... I wish I had done this for every computer I had ever installed xp on!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mention this because tooooooo many times, the xpcd will not be available/ or in useable condition when it is needed afterwards...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final thing every user with an xpcd might do is use the backup utility to backup the I386 directory to their hard drive, creating a blank, new folder, and then using backup to restore the backed-up files to an ALTERNATE LOCATION, namely that empty
 new folder they just created...THEN, RIGHT CLICK THAT NEWLY FILLED FOLDERS ICON, AND MARK IT AS READ ONLY... AND, IN EFFECT, YOU WILL NEVER NEED THE DISC AGAIN- until your hard drive takes a dump!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS IS SOLID, TIME PROVEN ADVICE, PEOPLE!!!</p>

There are no wrong questions...The easiest thing in the world to get is a wrong answer!!!

<p>Hasn't anyone ever told you that writing ALL-CAPS POSTS WITHEXCESSIVEPUNCTUATIONMAKES YOU SOUND HYSTERICALANDANGRY OR ELSE ARE A TOTAL SPEED-FREAK. PS IT IS VERY RUDE!!!</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>And if you'd read my post you would have probably&nbsp;seen that I don't&nbsp;have a CD&nbsp;drive, nor do I have an XP CD (doesn't come withe my Netbook). That stuff was all preinstalled on my Netbook, and no, I didn't get any Windows documentation either.</p>
<p>I also clearly stated that I didn't seem to have old restore points anymore, which suggests that I thought I'd made some. For the first two days I couldn't even access&nbsp;System Restore. Suddenly I was able to access it randomly out of the blue, and I saw there
 were no restore points past the date of infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, basically, your sanctimonious post is probably the least helpful thing I have read in relation to my problem. None of your suggestions would have been relevant to my case, especially not after the fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the issue description it seems that the computer doesn’t recognize Sony Cybershot Model DSC-W650 on the computer. I do understand the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have any USB or external drives worked on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does the camera work fine on other computers?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you tried plugging it to other USB ports and checked if it is working fine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us try performing the following steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that the hardware device is compatible with your computer and with your version of
<span>Windows</span>. If the device isn't compatible, you will need to find the correct driver. Check the information that came with your device. You can also search for the device on the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><b><span>Windows 7</span></b></span><span> Compatibility Center</span></a> website. This website contains a comprehensive list of computers and devices that have been tested to work
 with <span>Windows 7</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Many devices require special drivers to work properly. Be sure that you have installed any software discs that came with the device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer. Restarting might be necessary if the driver requires it, or if the driver didn't install correctly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If the device is a universal serial bus (USB) device, disconnect it and then plug it in to a different USB port.
<span>Windows</span> should detect the device and install the drivers, and notify you if the device drivers didn't install properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Updated drivers might be available through
<span>Windows</span> Update. When you check <span>Windows</span> Update, click <span>
View available updates</span> to determine if an updated driver is available for your device. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></a>.</span></p>

</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</span></p>

            Hello  
<br />
<br />I am Vicky, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />To take a screenshot on Windows 8 is not as tough as we think. If the Skype app is in full-screen mode and you want to capture it, simply press “Windows” and “Prnt Scr” keys at the same time. Moreover, just like Windows 7 OS, you can as well take a screenshot of an active window by pressing “Alt+Prnt Scr” keys.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have any further question about this issue let me know. I am here to help you.

<h2>            MapPoint 2011 will not install in Win 7 x64</h2>
                    At startup, the software required the install of Visual C++ Redistributable Package, Office Access Database, Engine, and Microsoft.NET Framework.&nbsp; None of these would self install so I downloaded them from the Microsoft website and installed all.&nbsp; However,
 the system does not recognize that the Office Database Engine is installed.&nbsp; It keeps asking for it, says it will install it and then bombs out.&nbsp; I have my antivirus turned off for the install as well.&nbsp; The software is from my Action Pack Subscription and
 there is not option to download a 64 bit version.&nbsp; I presumed it would run on both op systems, but........

            Hi  LORIHEIZER
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />The Phone Companion app that came with earlier versions of Windows 10 has now been replaced by 'Your Phone' app. If you are running Windows 10 1903, it should already be included. You can also download it from the Store:

            sorry, but I finally figured out.&nbsp; Now Your Phone has undone half of what I did.&nbsp;

Re-build Windows 7
<div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp;
 You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you are likely into a re-install.&nbsp; Takes a lot of time, but not all attended time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the similar issue, however, I purchased Win 7 pro with the notebook. So I don't have the disc, but I have the license which is on the back of my Notebook. I am currently in Directory Repair Mode. Surely there is another way to fix this issue without
 a full installation.</p>

            <p>hi</p>
<p>an automatic update could have caused it, corrupted graphics driver, etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are a couple of things to try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>see if changing screen resolution, without updating Graphics Drivers, works</p>
<p>if not:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>go to your computer or graphics cards manufacturers website and look for the drivers download&nbsp;section</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>look for your computer or graphics card&nbsp;model number depending what you have&nbsp;and download and install the latest vista graphics drivers</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>then&nbsp;try doing the screen resolution changes</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution</a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Change screen resolution </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>__________________________________________________________</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>or try a system restore to before&nbsp;this happened</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/system_restore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/system_restore.htm</a></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>if necessary do it in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Vista</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Restart your computer.</div>
</li><li>
<div>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the<strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select the <strong>Safe Mode</strong> option using the arrow keys.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.</div>
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>
<div>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.</div>
</li></ol>
<p>________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if an update caused this to happen&nbsp;change how&nbsp;you get updates to let you choose what you install to stop it happening again</p>
<p>you may have to install them one at a time to find the problem one</p>
<p>make sure that you do not use Windows Update to install 3rd party Hardware drivers</p>
<p>get them direct from the Hardware manufacturer</p>
<p>and when you see the problem&nbsp;update right click on it - UAC prompt - then hide it</p>

<p><strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong> - If you select this option, Windows will download updates to your computer, but not install them automatically. If you want to install the updates then you must install them manually.
 You should only select this option if you have a reason for not installing updates automatically. Only advanced users should use this option.</p>
<p><strong>Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them</strong> - If you select this option, you will be alerted when there are new updates available to download and install. You can then choose to download and install the updates
 that you wish. This option should really only be used by people who know exactly what updates they need or those who have limited access to the Internet.</p>

<p>Then in the resulting Window click Advanced Display Settings</p>
<p>Set your resolution to the on marked (Recommended)</p>
<p>If none of the resolution settings are marked (recommended) then you need to update your Display Driver</p>

<p>A new video card replace your ATI card? It could be a simple problem of a technician not removing traces of the old driver.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>How old is your Graphics card.&nbsp; It could very well be that your graphics card is the cause of the problem.&nbsp; If it is faulty then windows might not be recognising it and therefore will be giving this type of message.&nbsp; It could be this that has been causing
 your problems from the beginning.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you receive any error message?</div>
<div>Did you try updating the Windows updates one by one?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue could occur if some of windows update components are corrupted, hence we will try to reset windows Update components and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You need to follow the below provided link to run the fixit which will automatically fix the issue if you find any issues with the fixit then you can follow the further procedure to manually reset Windows update component.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How do I reset Windows Update components? </strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971058</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>We will try to install the updates one by one and check for the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Download and install the Windows Update agent</div>
<div>The Windows Update Agent lets you manage which updates will be installed on your computer. The Windows Update Agent works together with the Windows Update Web site to provide the latest updates to your computer. The Windows Update Agent also works together
 with servers that are running Microsoft System Management Server and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) in a corporate environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information about how to download and install the latest Windows Update agent, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to obtain the latest version of the Windows Update Agent to help manage updates on a computer</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the above solution doesn’t resolve the issue then follow the below provided steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now try to install the standalone version of the updates and check if it resolves the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To do that you need to enter the KB number of the Windows update in the search field of the below provided link.</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/search/</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the above provided solution doesn’t resolve the issue then you may hide the updates which are causing the issue, to do that you can follow the steps provided below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Windows Update , select the update you want to hide and then right click and select "Hide update". Allow the action when prompted to by User Account Control.</div>

            1. This might be an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.
