    <title>Work Around for Upcoming Lack of Support for Individuals Using Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> online educator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Work Around for Upcoming Lack of Support for Individuals Using Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a disabled teacher who has had to work from home and teach courses online for the past 11 years, since I can't work in the field anymore, and Windows 7 has served me very well in this endeavor. In fact, shortly before it was announced that Windows 7
 is effectively being abandoned, I searched all over to replace my dying computer with another that has Windows 7, and I finally found and bought a great laptop that has it, because I have Windows 10 on a tablet and I CAN'T STAND WINDOWS 10, so I do not use
 it for work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that, for a fee, Microsoft will provide extended support for Windows 7 for three years, but it sounds like it will only be for companies (and probably cost an arm and a leg). Can people suggest alternatives for individuals who will continue to use
 Windows 7 but without the necessary supports, such as those of us who work from home --and don't have the money to pay for support anyways? (My school does not provide any equipment or financial assistance for the technology we must use.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also a senior who can't afford to retire because my Social Security is not enough to live on, so I MUST work to survive and this upcoming lack of support for Windows 7 is really disconcerting to me, particularly the lack of updates which address issues
 around security, privacy, malware, etc.</p>

<p>With end of support Microsoft is not telling you that your operating systems won't work.</p>
<p>What they are saying is that after a certain date they will no longer support them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether they still work or not with particular programs&nbsp;is up to the particular program manufacturers.</p>
<p>Example: Google Chrome is no longer supported for security updates in XP or Vista by Google and Mozilla Firefox&nbsp;is following the same path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this basically means with Microsoft no longer supporting&nbsp;an operating system&nbsp;is that even though hackers may find "holes" and vulnerabilities to be able to access the operating systems and cause security problems, Microsoft will no longer be&nbsp;monitoring
 or rectifying those problems by way of Security Updates each month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are on your own in regards to maintaining the Security of your operating systems.</p>

</p><p><strong>Windows 7 Extended Security Updates<br />
</strong>As previously announced, Windows 7 extended support is ending January 14, 2020. While many of you are already well on your way in deploying Windows 10, we understand that everyone is at a different point in the upgrade process.</p>
<p>With that in mind, today we are announcing that we will offer paid Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) through January 2023. The Windows 7 ESU will be sold on a per-device basis and the price will increase each year. Windows 7 ESUs will be available
 to all <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Enterprise customers in Volume Licensing</strong></span>, with a discount to customers with Windows software assurance, Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Education
 subscriptions. In addition, <span>Office 365</span> ProPlus will be supported on devices with active Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) through January 2023. This means that customers who purchase the Windows 7 ESU will be able to continue to run
<span>Office 365</span> ProPlus.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Please reach out to your partner or Microsoft account team for further details.</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>This time around, the ESU program is being run out of Microsoft's Volume Licensing Unit and Core Windows Engineering "is producing these updates like a product," Spataro explained.</p>

 still after more than 3 years since Windows 10 was introduced.&nbsp; Come January 2020, the medical field is expected to have 71% of their PCs still running Windows 7.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My clients are all keeping their Windows 7 systems.&nbsp; There is no very good reason you need to invest in a new computer, particularly if you are like most
 and use your computer mostly for email and browsing the web.&nbsp; The only thing that should prevent you from using your computer is if it needs to be replaced or some piece of software you need is no longer available.</span></p>

<p>Take a screen capture of it.</p>
<p>You can use the Snipping Tool or use the Ctrl + PrtScn Keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Ctrl + PrtScn you will have to use Paint to open it in.</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<p>Press the Ctrl + PrtScn.</p>
<p>Open Paint.</p>
<p>Select the clipboard.</p>
<p>Click on Paste.</p>
<p>The image will appear.</p>
<p>Select Save As and choose how you want to save it.</p>
<p>You should be now able to print it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also convert it to a Pdf once saved providing you have a Prog to convert it with.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>My bro and I had this trying to Play Ryse, figured we would try the party chat and yes, for whatever reason, it seems like MS thought it was a good idea to have us join a party, but automatically turn chat off, so myself AND my brother from his end had to
 snap our party chat and both turn on the chat function. &nbsp;If I am joining a party, we should automatically be able to talk, not jump through more hoops. &nbsp;I already get annoyed paying multiplayer games with people who don't say anything and it takes away from
 the strategy and meeting people. &nbsp;But giving us the easy way out by not being able to talk, makes it so people don't even want to mess with it in the first place and its just pure silence. &nbsp;So annoying.</p>

<p>Hi i have the same problem can not join other people's party's also people can not join mine. and just &nbsp;a bit feed back on the xbox one the party system has always been bad the 360 was just right easy to use and smooth 1 of my biggest misses from the 360
 is the party option and i don't like how you can not see who you just played online without going back to dashboard just feels a bit messy ATM and confusing to the average gamer</p>

<p>To answer your questions as old as this thread is, here is a link to an official post detailing the new update.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Also a current workaround is to exit your games, go back to the dashboard, hit the menu button and quit the game.&nbsp; Join and create your party, turn on chat and then continue with your game.</p>

<p>My brother and I tried to start a party last night as well, but every time we tried accepting the party invite, it simple asked us to start a party. &nbsp;It was seriously frustrating as we had to use Skype to communicate with each other, this of course caused

                    <p>i had issues with opening of the start menu in my laptop after my latest update for windows 10. i received a suggestion in the community to create a local standard user account and also delete the previous account. i did the same and now i do not have a
 admin account in my laptop. i want to change the local account into admin account and get administrator access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i already tried using the option of command prompt, to use <strong>net user administrator /active:yes
</strong>but i am getting an error. when checked in the command prompt option it shows one my accounts as a administrator. but when i check in the Control Panel&gt; User accounts, it shows as standard account. Also the status of the admin account is
<strong>"NO" </strong>in the command prompt for user status.</p>

            <p>Hi Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the account from the control panel itself from user control. I had two admin accounts earlier, so i was able to delete the other account. Then i changed the other admin account into standard account. Later as i already said earlier, i created
 a new account from the user control, as a standard account itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option, that you asked me to try i already tried but i get an error. To change the access i need to have admin access to either of the accounts, if i am not wrong. Now to be clear, i have a admin account, but it's admin access is being disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help to activate the admin access, kindly help me to activate the admin access. I tried to activate using the command prompt option by login from the admin account itself, but it doesn't activate.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WerFault.exe - Application error</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The instruction at 0x0000000004E17F9 refrenced memory at 0x000000000D82ff. The memory could not be written.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Then again, if I try downloading using Edge, the browser closes and downloads does not start.</p>
<p>Every time I am typing something, there is a pause for about 3-4 seconds after few characters (3-4 characters).</p>
<p>Win 10 is making my life a real trouble as I need my laptop for all my work. Should these issues not be resolved, I am planning to jump back to win 7.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop mouse from waking computer from sleep mode &#40;or at least make it less sensitive&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    In Windows XP: You could select "Stand-by" mode to put the computer into a reduced-power state without actually shutting down.&nbsp; Then you pushed the power button to restore the computer.&nbsp; That option apparently does not exist in Windows-7.&nbsp; Instead the
 only options are shut-down or sleep/hibernation.&nbsp; The problem is that in sleep or hibernation, the slightest vibration or stimulation (closing of a desk drawer, etc.) of the mouse wakes up the computer when I don't want that to happen.&nbsp; Does anybody know how
 to create the old "stand-by" mode of XP in Windows 7, or alternatively, at least make the mouse less sensitve to vibrations causing a computer wake up?<br />

            Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
run DeviceManager (devmgmt.msc) and select your mouse and select the properties. Now go to the power options tab and
<strong>uncheck</strong> the checkbox "Allow this device to wake up the PC".<br />

<h3> donald soutar  say:</h3>
<h2>            LAN Connection Stopped working on my computer running WIN XP MEDIA CENTER </h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; My LAN connection stopped working on my computer running WIN XP MEDIA CENTER. I access the internet with&nbsp;optimum online. I have a wireless router ( US Robotics ) connected to my cable&nbsp;modem and the desktop with the wired connection stopped working. My
 wireless connection on my laptop works fine through the same network. I first shutdown the modem, router and computer and re booted all. Modem 1st, Router 2nd and then computer. Usually works but not this time. Contacted optimum online and went through some
 procedures to rectify the problem. Opened cmd prompt, Tried ping only to get 3 no replys and 1 reply. Tried ipconfg /renew, didn't work.&nbsp; Had Firewall shut down&nbsp;during all this. Service rep from optimum online said he could see my modem was working but something
 like a firewall was blocking my computer from being accessed. Tried ipconfig /all and gave him the ip address he asked for that was showing, 169.254.80.196, he said that address&nbsp;won't work and we kept trying to renew ip address and we couldn't do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now i didn't mention here that&nbsp;this problem occured when&nbsp;i had a&nbsp;power&nbsp;surge while i was online. I rebooted and this is the problem I've been&nbsp;having.&nbsp;I asked the optimum online rep what else could be causing this like a virus or&nbsp; the surge damaged my LAN
 or OS&nbsp;and&nbsp;he said for me to try getting in touch with microsoft and perhapse they could help me further. I hope someone has an answer for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please....HELP!!!</p>
<p>Thanks ,</p>

<p>The 169.254.x.x IP address shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The LAN connection is configured to obtain an IP address automatically, and: </li><li>It can't communicate with your router to get the address. </li></ul>
<p>The power surge might have damaged the computer's Ethernet adapter.&nbsp; If so, replacing it with a new adapter will fix the problem.</p>

                    <p>I have been using Skype to connect with out of town clients for years. Suddenly I try to login on Friday and I'm kicked out. A new version installs itself and asks me to login. I use the email address I have been using and it says "That Microsoft Account
 doesn't exist." I try logging in with my other email and it gets me in, but none of my profile information, contacts or call records are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there's NO SUPPORT from Skype? Just this forum?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Susan and thanks for your reply. I followed those steps and it took me right back to the other email (maybe they're both associated with the same account?). I still don't have access to my contacts, my profile picture and other information is missing
 and my call records are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>I have been using Skype to connect with out of town clients for years. Suddenly I try to login on Friday and I'm kicked out. A new version installs itself and asks me to login. I use the email address I have been using and it says "That Microsoft Account
 doesn't exist." I try logging in with my other email and it gets me in, but none of my profile information, contacts or call records are there.</p>

    <title>X axis inversion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haarfaager  say:</h3>
<h2>            X axis inversion</h2>
                    
<p>Every game I have played on every console since the invention of the thumbstick has either had the camera controls "inverted" or allowed me to do this. XBOX one does not allow this. The games and the system itself only allow inversion of the Y axis, which
 is only half a solution, and therefore absolutely useless.<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I look like I am raiding tombs drunk, staggering around awesome, beautiful games completely unable to enjoy them because the camera is backward. Whenever someone shoots at me I raise my weapon and then flail around like I'm having a seizure because aiming
 is impossibly counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Please fix this, or I'll just return it and get a PS4 from the people that invented the thumbstick. They know how it works.</p>

<p>Why would anybody want to move the stick left to look right? Inverting the Y axis makes sense, since that mimics the way an airplane works and that feels 'right' and intuitive to most people. But even in an airplane you move the stick left to go left.</p>

<p>This thread isn't really about why. </p>
<p>Although if i must make the argument, the reason you would want to is because you're moving the camera. If you want you see to the left you move the camera around the subject to the right and so forth. If the subject for which you act as puppeteer in a game
 had a joystick protruding from their occipital lobe, it would be operated thusly, like a camera on a tripod</p>
<p>Contrarily, I also personally can't imagine why anyone would want to do it the other way, which "most people" find intuitive.</p>

<p>Well that makes sense. I guess it's all in how you visualize it. Myself I tend to think of the camera as the eyes of the "subject" as you put it so moving the stick left to see left makes sense. I've never understood the default Y axis most games have, I
 always invert it... although I'd argue the default is the true inversion. But I never invert the X axis. And that is why I asked, I couldn't understand why you'd 'fix' the Y axis but then mess up (from my perspective) the X axis. Now I understand.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Stuck at update screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ASUS K55 is two weeks old. Bought from Sears online. Win 7 SP1. 68 updates took overnight a week ago. Today it's stuck at update 5 of 7 for 9 hours. Cannot reboot - hold power button 15 seconds, it just goes back to update screen. Will not reboot. Do
 I need to remove the battery? It will not safe boot, safe mode, cold boot, pressing F8 does nothing, nothing, always goes back to update screen at update 5 of 7, no HD access anymore, cursor spinning but won't move, two periods keep shifting around, this baby
 is stuck. This is remanufactured unit so there is no recovery partition. Did make ASUS 4 DVD recovery disc set the first day, but come on, this is only two weeks old! IF it always goes back to update screen like this how would I be able to use the DVDs anyway?
 frustrating.... </p>

            Well, this was not helpful in my case. Searching other forums I found the<br />
correct answer was to shut it down (although this was really putting it into<br />
a sleep mode of some kind where the RAM is held I think?) and then to<br />
unplug the battery for 10 seconds. This erases the RAM and so when I<br />
then plugged in the battery and switched it on, it notified me that it did<br />
not shut down properly (duh?) and gave the option to boot into safe mode<br />
which I selected but then I got a phone call while it was booting, so I did'nt<br />
actually see what it did. When I got back everything had returned to normal.<br />
I then changed the Windows Update to manual, this should be the default.<br />
<br />
So I have the OEM (ASUS) recovery 4 x DVD set, which I made with the<br />
verify option, so I think they are good and will put this baby back to the<br />
way it was when I made them I expect. But I was a little nervous so I looked<br />
into getting a Windows 7 English 64 bit install ISO, which I got from the<br />
great river site as directed to by ASUS tech support which is at:<br />
<span><br />
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/</span></a><br />
</span><br />
and I used the Windows 7 USB DVD download tool to burn the ISO file<br />
onto a DVD, and this DVD WORKS FINE! But I am nervous about running<br />
this disc as a boot disc as I would not want to accidentally reinstall Win 7<br />
when I just wanted to poke around to try and fix something.<br />
<br />
So I found instructions on burning a Windows 7 boot CD, which I made.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-system-repair-disc<br />
<br />
but when I boot with it, it doesn't work, saying it is not a bootable disk.<br />
There is nothing wrong with my laptop, I am just trying out the disk.<br />
Here's the picture when I look at it - can anyone see something wrong?<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I put a screen shot here, but after I clicked Submit, it went away.<br />
<br />
The "System Repair Disc" I wanted to show has three folders and a file:<br />
boot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boot.sdi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,096 KB<br />
efi<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; microsoft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcd &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 256 KB <br />
sources<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boot.wim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 164,445 KB<br />
bootmgr.efi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 654 KB<br />
<br />
Again the Win 7 install DVD I made boots up JUST FINE (hooray!)<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 UK keyboard layout problem</h2>
                    <p>
Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm using windows 8.1 with a bluetooth keyboard (logitech k810). I'm french but i use qwerty layout.&nbsp;<br />
I'm encountering a strange issue, my keyboard is a UK qwerty and i tried to set a correct layout. The thing is when i browse layout into language panel, there is only US qwerty layout. Even UK qwerty layout is set as a US qwerty.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does anyone has a clue to fix this issue ?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my research and knowledge if at the time of installation language is selected as US English then in that case there might be a chance that the default layout might which your computer will select will be US English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you move to Windows 8.1? Is that you upgraded to Windows 8.1 or it cam preinstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer came preinstalled with Windows 8.1 and you have purchased it from US then there might be a chance that default layout will be of US qwerty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the screen shot provided below to know the difference between US qwerty and UK qwerty.

            Hi Tomáš,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for a quick update on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me gather certain information to get enough information at the current status of this issue:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Do you face the same issue when you boot the computer in safe mode? Does it still freeze?<br />
2) If no, did you check for the issue in clean boot state?</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have tried the methods suggested earlier, I would suggest you to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<strong>Apply a compatibility mode</strong>”:</div>

    <title>Connecting to XBL without UPNP enabled on router&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omar darwazeh-0810c5af-3a72-4c9a-b5df-9a50e126be99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to XBL without UPNP enabled on router&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, wondering if you could help,</p>

<p>I've disabled UPNP on my router, this has helped with my internet speeds by disabling the ability of my housemates to Portforward on our router for BitTorrent etc, not very nice I know, but they haven't paid me for their share of the internet anyway.</p>
<p>I am still able to use my Router settings to forward certain ports, i.e. for XBL, but my issue is that I run the ethernet cable through my laptop. When UPNP is enabled, I can connect flawlessly to XBL &amp; have a good experience playing, until my housemates
 begin throttling the bandwidth with their downloads.</p>
<p>Now even though I've forwarded the ports for XBL on the router, I still can't connect, it says it cannot find the network, so clearly UPNP is important, but there must be a way around this? I've tried altering the settings for the IP address on XBL, setting
 it to one the router can speak to, i.e my IP is 192.168.1.65~ &amp; I set the Xbox to 192.168.1.75, DNS settings the same as my laptop (through ipconfig /all) &amp; then using my default gateway, 192.168.1.254 (Thomson TG580 - terrible router, with minimal settings,
 no DNS settings / no QoS / no MAC filtering... nothing!). Still I cannot connect to XBL unless UPNP is enabled.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello Omar, first take a look at this page...</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../network-ports-used-xbox-live</a></p>
<p>If you have properly enabled each of those ports on your router for your xbox to use, make sure your Xbox 360 has a static ip address on your router, if it's allowed to change those ports being open will have no effect on your system.</p>
<p>Also if you have more than 1 xbox 360 or other gaming systems that need ports opened Upnp is the only way, opening ports manually is only allowed for 1 device on the network per port.</p>
<p>If you have tried all of this and still have problems, try these steps.</p>
<p>1. Turn off your Xbox 360</p>
<p>2. Unplug your modem</p>
<p>3. Unplug your router.</p>
<p>4. Wait roughly 1 minute</p>
<p>5. Plug in your modem and wait for it to fully start up.</p>
<p>6. Plug in your router and wait for it to start up.</p>
<p>7. Check router settings, make sure ports are still open and ip is set for console.</p>
<p>8. Turn on Xbox 360</p>
<p>9. On your xbox 360 go to Network settings</p>
<p>10. Restore default settings on your console for network.</p>
<p>After this it should connect to xbox live.</p>
<p>If this solves your problem you will simply need to restore the default network settings on your Xbox 360 each time you turn it on, as the Xbox 360 does have issues with some routers.</p>

            <p>Hey there Omar!<br />[quote user="Omar Darwazeh"]Thomson TG580 - terrible router[/quote] I second that!<br /><br />Firstly: Make sure your Thomson's firmware is up-to-date with the latest version.<br /><br />Second: There is a simple rule when it comes to directing network ports (manually or automatic) with UPnP or Port Forward, do not&nbsp;use these two features&nbsp;at the same time. Having UPnP enabled at the same time as Port Forward will overwrite the last one.<br /><br />Is your Xbox connected to a computer and use its internet connection to connect to Xbox LIVE (ICS/Bridge)?</p>

            Hi PapperBoy, 
<br />
<br />Let’s run through this list to see if we can get this game downloaded. 
<br />
<br />App troubleshooter - <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F2...</a> - download and run and see if it finds anything wrong with the store. 
<br />
<br />Next, let’s clear the cache - Hit the windows key + r, then type “wrreset.exe” and hit enter.  This will clear the windows store cache. Let’s check the store again. 
<br />
<br />Let’s try these things, and see if you can download roblox. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            click start and type cmd, right click and run as admin. Type:
<br />“net stop wuauserv” and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type control panel - file explorer options - click the view tab, and make sure “show hidden files...” is buttoned off. 
<br />
<br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and delete the content of the Download folder. 
<br />
<br />Click start again, type cmd, right click and run as admin, type:
<br />“net start wuauser” and hit enter.
<br />
<br />Once this is done, reboot. 
<br />
<br />Click start - Settings - Updates and Security - Windows Updates - see if any new updates are pending. Once done, try again to download roblox. 
<br />
<br />If no dice, Is there any chance you could send a screenshot of the error to me? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder.
<br />
<br />***can you try to download another game? I’m curious if it’s all games in the store or just roblox***

            Ok, I’m sorry this hasn’t helped. Without any feedback it’s tough for me to keep troubleshooting. I’ll do whatever I can to help, but I need to know what you’ve tried.

<h2>            Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 &#40;Definition 1.111.1045.0&#41;</h2>
                    Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.111.1045.0) - (size 16.6mb) Is this update safe to download?, I have searched microsoft's website for it &amp; it cannot be found, &amp; notice once installed cannot be removed. It has shown up as
 a new update to install a few times now, with a more recent date each time!?! &nbsp;I am not sure if this is safe. I have seen question's about similar update's but not with the same definition. can anyone help please?&nbsp;
