            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such feature available for Windows 10 similar to Apple finder. However, you can use the start menu and personalize it. For that you may refer to the article mentioned below.</p>

<h2>            How do I find out what Windows memory diagnostic found &#63;</h2>
                    <p>All there is is a small box that says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>" your computer has a memory problem" &nbsp;" memory problems can cause your computer to lose information or stop working . To identify and repair the problem contact the computer manufacturer ".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some place I can look and see just what it found ?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having all kinds of problems like, the blue screen memory dump, google chrome aw snap crash a lot , I was playing a game and it crashed to desk top then I could not start any programs with out restating the computer, the computer stopped responding
 in the middle of the Windows up date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When these problems started I thought ok I have this Windows 7-64bit running for 3 years so I re installed every thing and the same things happened , so I did it again but this time I used my XP disk to do the long format it took 6 hours to do the 2Tb hard
 drive if there was any viruses that should have killed them and the drive should be as close to new as I can get it but I still have all the same problems .</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have run scan disk no problems, right now my CPU usage is 6% ,RAM is 1.78GB used out of 8GB on task manager .</p>
<p>My computers performance scores are</p>
<p>Processor 7.2</p>
<p>Memory RAM 7.4</p>
<p>Graphics 7.4</p>
<p>Gaming Graphics 7.4</p>
<p>Hard drive 5.9</p>
<p>It says I have a memory problem but I have never seen more than about 2.8Gb of RAM being used I think my motherboard is going bad some thing to do with the LAN part of the board because all the problems seem to have some thing to do with the internet , but
 I would like to know what it found in case it's the hard drive and not the MB before I spend a lot of money on the wrong parts. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I try ed taking the RAM out and putting back in, ran the test again but didn't get that lucky still bad , so I took the RAM out of another &nbsp;PC and TA-DA ! it passed the test and every thing works now no more crashes.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if it was "Windows memory (RAM) diagnostic" &nbsp;instead of Windows memory diagnostic so first time user like me knows just which memory it is testing , I found it by accident and didn't know what it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your internet browser crashes a lot especially google chrome "aw snap" crash and programs crash back to desktop run this tool it could be your RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this maybe of help to others. &nbsp;</p>

            The message text for that code is MSG_E_BADCHARDATA, which means "An invalid character was found in text content". So, you have an invalid character

    <title>How long do warranty replacements for the Surface actually take&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuttgart21  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long do warranty replacements for the Surface actually take&#63;</h2>
                    My Surface stopped recognizing my Type cover seemingly at random and I took it in and they said Microsoft would send me a replacement. They opened a service order and told me I should expect it in the mail. That was 9 days ago and I still have no updates
 or anything on the item. It's says "In Progress" since the day I opened the order. On the mysurface.service.com site it also says "Reprint shipping label" (for whatever reason?), so I'm assuming that's the label they might use to ship the Surface out with?
 I tried typing in the tracking number on it and FedEx says "Not Found".&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm not sure who to talk to to find out more information, or if they lost my Surface / didn't seem to mail it out?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an in-store receipt that reads In-Warrant Exchange (IW) price 0.00 and what not, I had to ask for the service order number, which I wrote on the receipt.</div>

            <p>Hi there Stuttgart21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you had troubles with your Touch Cover, but&nbsp;I am glad you were able to set up a replacement. &nbsp;I would not be concerned that the shipping labels are still available to print; once the status is updated, that option will change to "track shipment".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the latest details on your replacement, I recommend chatting one on one with one of our Answer Techs,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful.&nbsp; Please let us know if you have any further questions.</p>

<h2>            Cant install Windows Updates. Error 1935 when installing Office 2010.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: <span>error 1935 when trying to install office 2010 on Windows 7. __Also: error opening installation log file when opening updates.</span></p>
<p>I am running windows on an 32bit&nbsp;intel based mac, and everything has worked fine until trying to intall office 2010 home and student version.&nbsp; It always gives me error 1935.&nbsp; The last time I tried it gave me 4 files that were supposedly causing the problems:</p>
<p>...appdata\local/temp\WER1CP.temp.app.compat.txt</p>
<p>...appdata\local\temp\WER2F3.tmp.WERinternalmetadata.xml</p>
<p>...appdata\local\temp\wer4254.tmp.hdmp</p>
<p>...appdata\local\temp\WER4254\tmp.xml</p>
<p>Also, and perhaps related, I have a really hard time installing updates.&nbsp; When I try to install updates from the program on the control panel, nothing ever happens.&nbsp; It ussually just stays on "downloading updates--0%compete" for&nbsp;forever.&nbsp; I tried downloading
 KB954430 manually from the microsoft updates website and it tells me there is an error opening installation log file and quits the installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for some reason I hadn't been able to download/install .NET FRAMEWORK4 for forever, but somehow on probably the 20th time I tried, it worked (or least it told me it installed).&nbsp; So I do apparently do have the working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARG!!</p>
<p>please help! thank you.</p>
<p>(p.s. my knowledge of software and computers is pretty limited, so please keep this in mind when answering my question.&nbsp;thanks!)</p>

<p><span>Hi Bradleye,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 other programs install fine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any antivirus program installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The two issues you have posted are more or less related to each other.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>For Windows Updates:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Run the Windows Update troubleshooter and check

<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help, try installing the updates
 in a clean boot state and see if it helps. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>

 the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Click OK, and then click Restart. Install the updates after the restart.</span></p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for your reply. unfortunately nothing you listed worked.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; running the update trouble shooter/diagnostic failed:&nbsp; error# 0x80131700,&nbsp; Path: non-local package,&nbsp; Source:engine (failed in regular and clean boot)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the clean boot, disabling non-microsoft stuff.&nbsp; nothing changed</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I do not have any antivirus installed.&nbsp; ( I am running windows on my Mac primarily so I can use one program- ArcDesktop-- that does not run on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac&nbsp;OS.&nbsp; I didn't think I would be doing much that would expose me to viruses, though I do check my email/facebook
 while using windows.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I tried to repair the Microsoft.NET 4 framework.&nbsp; The repair failed because it said there was another update in progress.&nbsp; I used the task manager to ensure that the windows updater was not running, and the repair still failed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The "Turn Windows Features on or Off" box&nbsp;does not work.&nbsp; it's completely blank.</p>
<p>6. New info!&nbsp; windows update now gives me an error code# 643</p>
<p>7. new info!&nbsp; Now, Office 2010 installation&nbsp;gives me an error# 2908&nbsp; {39A436F1-525F-4D9C-95E5-01D682F0FB25}</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The only other major program I installed on Windows is ArcDesktop, which installed fine and is working great thus far.&nbsp; I installed Adobe reader, microsoft silverlight, apple quicktime, and Hewlitt Packard printing drivers.&nbsp; That's about it, besides
 some Apple stuff that I installed at the beginning (it was recommend because I am splitting my hard drive between the mac and windows.</p>
<p>9. could all these problems be due to a virus??</p>
<p>10. What a mess!&nbsp; Please help! Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Syed N,</p>
<p>I read through and tried both articles and still the problems persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I run the system file checker as described in the first article you linked, I got the message:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;"Windows Resources Protection could not start the repair service"</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried again, with the same result.</p>
<p>I tried to do the system restore, but the only dates listed were for August 18th, and the problems began well before Aug 18th.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, I did not run the system restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The second article appears as though it's not for Windows7 but for earlier versions of Windows.&nbsp; The Automatic "Fix It" program did not run, saying<strong>"Microsoft fix does not apply to your operating system or application."</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I created the
 "Logging on" and "Logging off" programs as desicribed in the article under the heading,&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me fix it myself" , but&nbsp;I&nbsp;did not run them when I realized that Windows 7 was not mentioned in the article.&nbsp; I did not want to run something not meant for the operating
 system.&nbsp; Should I try it anyway?</p>
<p>Any other ideas?&nbsp; Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brad</p>
<p>p.s.&nbsp; in addition to all the other problems I listed in the previous post,&nbsp;the internet connection wizard thing doesn't work either.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bradleye,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The TrustedInstaller service has full access to Windows Resource Protection (WRP) files and registry keys, and this services needs to be running
 in order to restore missing or corrupted WRP resources. The TrustedInstaller service starts on-demand when running the System File Checker.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Let`s check if the TrustedInstaller (Windows
 Modules Installer) service is disabled. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type “s<span>ervices.msc” (without quotes) and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click<span>Windows

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Set
 its Startup type to&nbsp; <span>Manual</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK. Now see if you can run the SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help then, try performing an
 offline SFC scan from the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRe).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 the arrow keys to choose Repair your Computer in the Windows Advanced Boot Menu Options and then press ENTER.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So I eventually had to completely reinstall windows. &nbsp;It worked great for a few hours, but sometime after I finally finished getting all the programs and old files back on the computer, the same problems began again. &nbsp;(I even installed windows security essentials
 and scanned my old files&nbsp;for viruses&nbsp;&nbsp;before copying them to the hard drive.)</p>
<p>I followed both steps you suggested above.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The windows modules installer was already on start up "manual" . &nbsp;I tried the sfc /scannow, with the same results as above</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;ran the sfc /scannow in WinRe and it said, &nbsp;"There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. &nbsp;restart windows &nbsp;and run sfc again."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rebooted several times with &nbsp;same result. &nbsp;I had had some problems with having to force shut-down windows due to it endlessly &nbsp;trying&nbsp;nstall updates at shutdown, so I thought that might have been the issue. &nbsp;I went back into normal mode and disabled
 all of the updates services which allowed me to shutdown normally. &nbsp;I tried Sfc /scannow one more time in WinRe, with the same result. &nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, I also have a person from phone tech support helping me, and he is going to get back to me in a few days.
 &nbsp;Nobody seems to be able to figure this out. &nbsp;I have spent a lot of time on this.</p>

<p>The telephone support person had me run the online "one care safety scanner" &nbsp;It told me I had no viruses. It did say that I had found 212 registry items. &nbsp;I ran the repair on them with the program and it told me it had cleaned 210 of them and that there
 were two errors. &nbsp;it said, "<strong>com/activeX (2 errors)</strong>" &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, trying to run system restore did not work, again. &nbsp;It gave me errors ( at different instances) of<strong>0x800705aa, Incorrect function 8x0007001,</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;catastrophic failure 0x80000FFFF</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last question:</p>
<p>After I reinstalled windows, I installed windows updates, loaded necessary apple drivers, and installed Office 2010, ArcGIS desktop, and Microsoft Security Essentials. &nbsp;All of this worked great. &nbsp;I then copied files associated with ArcGIS that I had been
 working with before (reinstalling windows) back onto the hard drive. &nbsp;As mentioned before, I scanned &nbsp;the CDs that had these files before I copied them back on to the hard drive, and they scanned free of viruses. &nbsp; I have not opened any of these files yet.
 &nbsp;Is it even possible that these files could have contained a virus that the virus scanner did not recognize? &nbsp;If there was a virus &nbsp;on those CDs could it have infected my computer without me having even opened any of the files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, &nbsp;your help is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Many reports have came from Germany about Sleeping Dogs, that they can't download it. By the way, does it give you "This game is not available for consoles in your region", or do you just get to pin it and rate it only?</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player not installed properly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elijah cunningham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player not installed properly&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I try to play a music file or open the Media Player I get an error message that says that Windows Media Player is not installed properly and that it needs to be re-installed. It then asks if I would like to install the Player from the Microsoft
 website. When I click "yes" it sends me to this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/download-windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/download-windows-media-player</a>&nbsp;and I downloaded the Media
 Feature Pack, but this did not solve the problem. I also tried to install Window Media Player 11 for Windows XP, but this did not help either. Does anyone know how to solve this issue?

    <title>Problems changing from IDE to AHCI in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems changing from IDE to AHCI in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hey folks --
<div>I've been looking at switching to AHCI mode for our two machines at home. &nbsp;My wife's is running Windows 7 and mine is Win 8. &nbsp;Both of them were installed with legacy IDE running, so I've had to investigate how to make the change after-the-fact. &nbsp;With the
 Win 7 machine, I found and installed the correct drivers for the motherboard, did the registry hack, etc. &nbsp;It wasn't as simple as it was supposed to be, but it did finally work. &nbsp;That last boot, Win 7 grabbed onto the drivers and ran with them, and now the
 machine is humming along in AHCI mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Win 8 machine is a different story. &nbsp;The registry hack is a little different, and there are a couple different variations, none of which has succeeded in producing anything but the BSOD. &nbsp;I also found a method using Safe Mode, but this doesn't work
 any better. &nbsp;At this point, I have the BIOS with SATA Configuration set to "AHCI", but at POST it still recognizes all my drives as "IDE". &nbsp;The "Standard AHCI Controller" is showing up in Device Manager as "working properly", and it says its drivers are all
 up to date. &nbsp;What am I missing? &nbsp;(For that matter, is there someplace other than POST where you can actually find Windows saying it's running in AHCI mode?)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before anyone asks, here's what I'm running:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ASUS M3A78-CM motherboard, Socket AM-2 (latest BIOS, #2801)</div>
<div>AMD Athlon 64X2 6000+ 3.1GHz processor</div>
<div>Windows 8 32-bit, Build 9200</div>
<div>4GB RAM</div>
<div>OCZ Agility 4 256GB SSD (basically, the main reason I want AHCI and NCQ, so I can have TRIM support)</div>
<div>Seagate 1TB SATA HDD</div>
<div>Seagate 1.5TB SATA HDD</div>
<div>SATA DVD-RW</div>
<div>IDE DVD-RW (this is currently the only real IDE device in the system)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The registry hacks are all some variation under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\, but some say to change Error Control VD to 0, while some say to change Start VD to 0, some say to change StartOverride to 0, some say to delete
 StartOverride altogether, etc. &nbsp;I haven't found the magic combination, yet. &nbsp;Each one results in a BSOD, Windows diagnosing itself, and giving me a Restore option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Safe Mode option results in a clean boot, but Windows still does not go into AHCI mode after the BIOS change. &nbsp;One version of this approach recommended simply uninstalling the IDE controller in Device Manager, supposedly forcing the AHCI controller
 to install at reboot. &nbsp;The problem with this is that I do have that one IDE device plugged up, and so the system knows it needs to reinstall IDE for that. &nbsp;I tried simply disabling it, and the AHCI controller did install (as in, it shows up with good drivers
 in Device Manager), but still POST shows IDE drives. &nbsp;(One option that occurs to me is to try this with the IDE optical drive unplugged, and see what happens.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'll keep trying various combinations of both, but I thought I'd see if anyone has anything good to offer, here. &nbsp;(Each attempt is time-consuming, waiting for Windows to diagnose and "repair" itself... I only have time for one or two of those, before work.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems you would also have to make certain changes to the settings in BIOS after going through&nbsp;the changes&nbsp;in registry&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;change the SATA hard driver mode from IDE to AHCI mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Nope, just one SATA controller.</div>
<div><br />
The information Sonny got was similar to what I found earlier, though opinions differed as to whether it was best to tweak StartOverride from 3 to 0 or to remove it altogether. &nbsp;I've tried both. &nbsp;Somewhere between these registry hacks and the Safe Mode method,
 I seem to have it running in AHCI mode... but not. &nbsp;The AHCI Controller is active in Device Mgr, and the&nbsp;driver (storahci.sys) is showing as "up-to-date" and doesn't want a better one. &nbsp;HOWEVER -- Anvil says my drives are running in IDE mode, and that is still
 the way they show up in POST. &nbsp;I'm kinda scratching my head, here...&nbsp;

Changing the BIOS switch from IDE to AHCI is always the last step in any of the solutions. &nbsp;With the Win 7 machine, it was like magic after that reboot. &nbsp;Not so much, with Win 8.
<div><br />
<div>I have been talking with the manufacturers, but this is a custom build, so "manufacturer" could be several different people, including me. &nbsp;ASUS tells me I only need the driver supplied in Win 8, although they do have a suggested set of drivers for download
 (but at 4 years old, they appear to be geared more for Win 7 than 8). &nbsp;AMD has an AHCI driver installation package which requires Catalyst Installer, makes a lot of splashy panels on the screen but nothing else. &nbsp;Nobody seems to have the one "right" answer
 on this one, but it sure seems that Win 7 did a stellar job of handling the whole issue, while 8 needs to be poked with a stick.</div>

<p>I'm don't know anything about Anvil, but it if your drives are in AHCI Mode, they will show up in the "Safely Remove Hardware" list on the lower right of your taskbar...</p>

<i><b>THANK YOU!! &nbsp;</b></i>Believe it or not, that is the first mention I've seen of that particular point. &nbsp;I think this qualifies as a "Doh!" moment. &nbsp;I just never thought to look there, but of course they should show up as "ejectable", if they're now hot-swappable.
 &nbsp;And the answer is... &nbsp; <i>YES!</i> &nbsp;All my drives are showing up there.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Just as a final note... I followed up this train of thought by looking at Properties for each of the drives, and lo and behold, each of them (other than the active system drive) is now showing hot-swap choices under a "Policies" tab. &nbsp;The default is to
 have them "ejectable" under that pop-up in the system tray, but the other option is to leave them as removable-at-will, without needing the ejection pop-up. &nbsp;Supposedly the default option gives a little better performance.
<div><br />
<div>Also, on my wife's newer Gigabyte board, there was an additional step to take in the BIOS, which this led me to... her drives weren't showing up the same way. &nbsp;Turns out you have to go drive-by-drive to enable "ESP support" (eSATA Port, I believe), which
 causes that Policies tab to appear in Properties. &nbsp;After that, they all appeared in the systray pop-up, just like mine (except for her active system drive, on which I left ESP disabled).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks, again, for the helpful nudge in the right direction!</div>

<p>It is a little slower using the "Safely Remove Hardware" method, but very slight...</p>
<p>The advantage of using it is that it insures that any data still in the drives Cache is written to the disk before ejecting...</p>

            <p>Here is a method that worked for me in switching to ahci from ide in Windows 8.1. I have cut and pasted the web article.</p>
<p>In later posts on the Microsoft Community, changing the bios setting to ahci and then booting up in Safe Mode by hitting the F8 key several times at boot also performed the change automatically.</p>

 ( Advanced Host Controller Interface ) offers native command queuing and hot plugging through SATA host controllers (Serial-ATA) for hard drives. In simpler terms, there’s no reason you shouldn’t use it.</p>
So, how do you enable it? Do you have to reinstall Windows 8 again?
<p>No. You can enable it without losing any data.</p>
<p>Enabling AHCI in Windows 8 requires going through the registry ( yes, it’s still there! ) but it’s slightly different than how it was done in
<a href="http://www.ithinkdiff.com/how-to-enable-ahci-in-windows-7-rc-after-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Vista and Windows 7</a>. You still have to modify a registry key but the key is different now. Follow the guide below to enable AHCI in but make sure that you’ve backed up your data as well as registry, just in case.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit all applications</li><li>Go to the start screen and type in <strong><a href="http://www.ithinkdiff.com/how-to-enable-ahci-in-windows-8-after-installation/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#2772b3"><span style="color: rgba(39, 114, 179, 1) !important">regedit</span></font></a></strong>.</li><li>If you see the UAC (User Account Control) dialogue box, just click continue.</li><li>Locate the the following registry subkey:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<strong>\</strong>SYSTEM<strong>\</strong>CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\</p>
</blockquote>
</li><li>Locate the Error Control entry which should have a value of 3.&nbsp;Right-click on the entry name, select Modify, change the value from 3 to 0 and click OK.</li><li>Open the StartOverride folder and locate an entry named 0 with a value of 3. Change the value to 0 by following the procedure in step 5.</li><li>Restart and enable AHCI in your system BIOS</li></ol>
Quick Alternate Method
<p>If you don’t feel safe playing with your registry like I don’t with a neighbor’s dog ( except that I can handle a messed up registry but not a messed up dog ), I suggest you download the registry file I’ve uploaded
<a href="http://cdn.ithinkdiff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ahci.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Just extract the .reg extension file from the compressed folder and run it and restart your computer. Do the obligatory AHCI switch on from your system BIOS and you’re good to
 go.</p>

    <title>USB Gamepad not recognized on Forza Horizon 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arauggio  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Gamepad not recognized on Forza Horizon 4</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I downloaded Forza Horizon 4 to my PC through Microsoft Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I discovered that the game does not recognize my USB gamepad no matter what I try. The gamepad works fine with all my steam (and non-steam) games (e.g. Life is Strange, The Wolf Among Us, Mortal Kombat XL, Street Fighter V, PES 2018, etc.),
 but with FH4, it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a ticket with Forza support, and they were evasive and just told me to try Microsoft support. The main problem is that I'm unable to have acess to the game folder, that is encrypted in the "Program Files/WindowsApps" folder. Otherwise I would be
 capable of using x360ce emulator to force the game to recognize my inputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a way to make the game to recognize my "Generic USB Controller" (or to gain full access to WindowsApps folder)? I would like to emphasize that "to buy an Xbox One Genuine Controller" is not an option because it costs 3 times the game itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Android hangs 5-10 seconds every time I enter or leave a conversation view or I press the send button</h2>
                    <p>Skype for Android hangs 5-10 seconds every time I enter or leave a conversation view or I press the send button. I use the app in version 8.15.76.7 (beta) on LineageOS 14.1 / Android 7.1.2, on a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini International LTE edition. While with
 1.5GB RAM the phone isn't super beefy, I don't have issues with anything else including web browser, RSS reader with many images etc., so unless Skype needs &gt;1GB RAM, I don't see why it should work that badly.</p>

            <p>I am also having problems using/reinstalling FSX Gold Edition. FSX used to work without problems on Wndows 7 Pro 64bit, but I have recently done the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro 64bit and tested the FSX.</p>
<p>It worked ok until I opened another window within FSX (maps, configuration settings, select aircraft, etc. etc.) then the whole screen went black and had to close the FSX program from the task manager.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to uninstall the FSX game to do a fresh install. I ran the
<strong>setup.exe</strong> program&nbsp;from the CD as administrator but I get this message each time....</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68945b90-aef3-4351-b171-c0c885f97b07" />
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to do a clean boot using the instructions via the link above and going into the services (via
<strong>msconfig</strong>) and disabling the services and restarting the computer.</p>
<p>The tried again the install FSX but the same message appears as above. Now I cannot even install the game!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the delayed response and the difficulties that you're facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest that you check for updates/patches for this game and install them. If there are no patches/updates yet available for Windows 10 in the

                    <p>Original Title: .ICM For Monitor Not Working</p>
<p>When using Windows 8.1 I applied a .ICM file to color management to fixed the washed out colors of my ASUS VG248QE monitor; however, after making a switch to Windows 10, the .ICM does absolutely nothing. &nbsp;The colors don't change when I add or remove any
 .ICM file for that matter, as if the feature in color management simply does nothing.</p>

            Where I downloaded the .ICM/.ICC file wouldn't have any bearing on if it works or not considering it's the same file I was using in 8.1. &nbsp;Secondly it's not just ONE .ICM/.ICC; I have tried this with many different files to see if any work and they do not.
 &nbsp;Thirdly, a .ICM/.ICC isn't a driver for a monitor, it is just <span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">

            <p>Hi, I just switched to Windows 10 and have exactly the same thing. I need colors to be accurate as I am a post processing photos. It was working perfect in Windows 8.1 but now Color Mgt seems to be doing nothing, no &nbsp;matter what .icm file I load.</p>
<p>@Nvlddmkm: did you figure out how to use the .icm files?</p>
<p>@Microsoft: Please HELP!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Well... that's what I posted one hour ago. And now, after some searching on the net, I have found out how to reactivate my ICM files. Strange that Microsoft seems not to be able to properly answer this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read the full solution on this page:&nbsp;https://pcmonitors.info/articles/using-icc-profiles-in-windows/</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it was the last step that did the trick. The previous steps I used to do in Windows 8.1 too. Apparantly you need to reset system defaults to use the ICM files provided. I guess because Win10 comes with its own calibration method??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, for all strugling with this. See the last step in this link to fix this problem :)</p>
