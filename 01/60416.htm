<h2>            Windows back after installing Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My HP desktop came with preinstalled Win 8.1. I updated it later to Windows 10 using free update offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I installed Ubuntu linux to it and formated the hdd. Ubuntu was unstable for some reason in my computer and now I need to get windows back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do I have to install win 8.1 first or can I jump straight to win 10? And is my product key stored into uefi-partion or do I even need product key with win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Apuvamies, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Boot again on Windows 8.1 and find the key following this procedure. Then you can upgrade to Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed.

<p>You can install directly Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your PC is once activated with Windows 10 you don't shouldn't need key any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installation&nbsp; program ask key you can click "I don't have a product key" and continue to select which edition (Home / Pro) you want to install, select that edition which you have had originally.</p>

            Just install WIndows 10 directly.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

<p>Well, If you have UEFI and formatted the drive, you might have destroyed the EFI partition. You will have to prepare the drive for that and the WRE partition with your C:\OS partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to do a Legacy BIOS install, Which is the best option in my opinion, then just set you BIOS for USB or CD/DVD boot 1st and C:\ OS 2nd and format and install. It should create the WRE and C:\ partitions.</p>

<h2>            Older Gateway Desktop PC Running WIndows 10 for Since 2016 Now Stuck on Windows Lock Screen, Can&#39;t Get to Login</h2>
                    <p>My PC has been Windows 10 nearly 2 years. &nbsp;May have upgraded recently but now can't get past Windows Lock Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the pretty Windows Lock Screen picture, date &amp; time in lower left corner, and network connection in lower right corner. &nbsp;The mouse moves the cursor and if I touch the keyboard or click the mouse I see my name and Login appear briefly before returning
 to Lock Screen. &nbsp;Ctrl-Alt-Delete does not work but does briefly induce my name to appear
<span>briefly before returning to Lock Screen.</span></p>
<span>briefly before returning to Lock Screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have searched</span></span>I have read other threads about a similar issue and the recommendations to restart in Safe Mode but I have not figured out how to get there.
 &nbsp;There is no Power indicator on the Lock Screen and even when I click the Network Connection icon it only cycles the Lock Screen. &nbsp;I have tried to fail boot process multiple times to get Windows to diagnose issue but at the end of that process two buttons
 appear Restart is highlighted and Advanced Options is not highlighted. &nbsp;However I don't have a touch screen and this screen is not responsive to mouse or keyboard (tab, enter, or anything). &nbsp;Thus unable to restart in Safe Mode because I can't get to the Advanced
 Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It began this last night and has continued this morning.</p>

<p>No solution yet.&nbsp; I did download the Create Media Tool and created a Windows 10 Home Install Disk on a Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the first time I tried to create media USB it failed.&nbsp; I quick formatted the 8GB USB and reran Create Media and was successful.&nbsp; I booted from USB pressed Next after Language (English), Time and Currency Format (English), and Keyboard or input
 Method (US).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggested steps but ran into problems every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on Repair Your Computer, Advanced Options, then Troubleshoot.&nbsp; Then I tried all the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Startup Repair, Windows 10 - This ran but ended with "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC", Press Advanced Options to try other options or "Shutdown to turn off your PC", Log File F:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pick Advanced Options, Troubleshoot</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) System Restore - Windows 10</p>
<p>I selected 5/16/2018 11:22:56 AM Automatic Restore Point System (Only option on list)</p>
<p>Initializing, Restoring Files, Then System Restore did not complete successfully.&nbsp; Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.</p>
<p>Details: An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070003)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pick Advanced Options, Troubleshoot</p>
<p>3) Command Prompt - Administrative X:\Windows\SYSTEM32\cmd.exe</p>
<p>Administrative Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1]</p>
<p>Not enough memory resources are available to process this command (I have 4GB RAM installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Go Back to the previous version</p>
<p>It starts to run but then returns me to the Continue, Troubleshoot, or Turn off Your PC options.</p>
<p>If I continue to load Windows 10, it takes me to the Windows Lock Screen with Time and Date in lower left corner and Network Connection in the lower right.&nbsp; If I hit any key or click the mouse, My name briefly appears before returning to the lock screen.&nbsp;
 Each successive key stroke or mouse click causes the screen to revert back to the lock screen without seeing my name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created a Recovery Disk from another identical Gateway Desktop Computer, same processor, hard drive, RAM configuration.&nbsp; I retried all of the above and had the same results.&nbsp; I also have tried this with and without a wired Ethernet connection with
 the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            Please go through the steps again to downgrade:
<br />
<br />These instructions have worked for so many, so if you are getting it, you are not doing some correct. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

            Thanks.&nbsp; I was able to load Windows 10 1703 and have access to my old files in the Windows.old directory.&nbsp; I disconnected from internet to prevent upgrades for now.&nbsp; I don't think Windows 10 1803 is the issue as I have an identical PC running it fine.&nbsp;
 I will make sure I recover all my data before attempting to upgrade Windows or loading my apps on the machine now running Windows 10 1703 (March 2017).

            <p>You can't because it is for Android only. &nbsp;BUT! &nbsp;You can search the Internet for "Android x86 ISO" and get the ISO image of the version of Android that will work with VMWare and VirtualBox (virtual machine software) and actually run Android on the tablet
 along with Windows 10. &nbsp;When you search, make sure that it is a Google certified image or you will get the Google Play store within it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been a "LOT" of people asking about running Android apps on these tablets and these tablets are "WINDOWS" not "ANDROID" which is a completely different system. &nbsp;Using a virtual machine is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google themselves have a development image of Android out there which is the latest version and best to try to find it. It would come from Google themselves. &nbsp;That image can be installed in laptops and desktops as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to go that route, install Google Chrome web browser and within "IT", it has a store of its own which are modified Android apps from Google. &nbsp;They have a lot of apps for it. &nbsp;The browser acts as a runtime engine for those apps and only
 play through that browser. &nbsp;But, that browser is also known to cause Surface tablets to overheat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, just get an Android tablet!!!!!</p>

</p><p>Oh after you do this if I actually understand what you are saying, After you do the first restore default in Location Tab, then go to&nbsp;other folder and do restore default in Location Tab. Then you may not have to create the opposite folder as I mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I also recommend to stop sharing your files in Homegroup first if you are as you may not be able to make any changes while it is shared and restart PC then do the above process.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok, I don't see how This PC\Folders and C:\Users\YOUR NAME\</p>
<p>could show 2 different scenarios. </p>
<p>They both are the same location and Target Locations of C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Music &amp; C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;****** If they are the same in This PC and C:\Users\YOUR NAME of duplicates of one folder and the&nbsp;other one is&nbsp;missing Then;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For precaution of preserving your files:</p>
<p>Did you have music or pictures in these folders. </p>
<p>
</p><p>if so, first in C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Music folder, cut and paste all music&nbsp;contents inside of it in&nbsp;to a new created folder on desktop.</p>
<p>Then change the name of Music&nbsp;to Public&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Music</p>
<p>Right click&nbsp;&gt;&gt; properties </p>
<p>General Tab &gt;&gt; Rename it to &gt;&gt; Pictures</p>
<p>Location Tab &gt;&gt; Rename it to &gt;&gt; &nbsp;C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Pictures </p>
<p>select apply and or OK and allow the process "OK" with the verification windows.</p>
<p>in the end it may say it will not complete lost location, just click on cancel and it will change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Pictures </p>
<p>open it and cut and paste all&nbsp;picture&nbsp;contents inside of it in&nbsp;to a new created folder on desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok now, right click on Pictures Folder</p>
<p>select Cut and right click on desktop and click paste. </p>
<p>You will have a 2nd System Pictures Folder, which is different than just creating a new folder and naming it.
</p>
<p>There is one on Desktop and one in C:\Users\YOUR NAME </p>
<p>as the cut and paste function will also leave the Pictures folder in C:\Users\YOUR NAME, unlike moving a normal folder by cut and paste.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to the&nbsp;Pictures Folder&nbsp;on Desktop </p>
<p>Right click&nbsp;&gt;&gt; properties </p>
<p>General Tab &gt;&gt; Rename it to &gt;&gt; Music</p>
<p>Location Tab &gt;&gt; Rename it to &gt;&gt; &nbsp;C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Music</p>
<p>select apply and or OK and allow the process "OK"with the verification windows.</p>
<p>in the end it may say it will not complete lost location, just click on cancel and it will change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you should have&nbsp;System Music and System Pictures Folders in C:\Users\YOUR NAME</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now cut music content from new created folder on desktop and paste into Music folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now cut&nbsp;pictures content from new created folder on desktop and paste into Pictures folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;****** If they are different in This PC and C:\Users\YOUR NAME, such as one is correct and the other is incorrect, go to the incorrect location; and do the&nbsp;same above procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>except first, save the music and picture content from inside these 2 folders&nbsp;that are in correct location&nbsp;in to temp created folders on desktop as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>When done, put music and pictures content from temp folders back in to Music and Pictures.</p>
<p>Then delete the 2 temp folders you created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a folder left on the desktop named Pictures or Music delete it. But before you empty the&nbsp;recycle bin, go to C:users\YOUR NAME
</p>
<p>and make sure that the 2 folders are there and content is inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then empty recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be done more easier for me in safe mode and also using the security settings to reset system folders. The system folder compared to regular folders have a LOCATION TAB and it can be tricky to fix system&nbsp;folder corruption. And you are already working
 with a corrupt folder that needs to be reset to its proper target location and since you have a duplicate that makes it ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually did this on mine (it worked but I restored mine back with system image in 10 minutes), although I did not have a duplicate M or P folder, I deleted&nbsp;My Pictures system folder&nbsp;and then used the other one like I explained above, Music, &nbsp;and the duplicate
 created music folder&nbsp;to desktop "cut and paste"&nbsp;was changed to a system pictures folder and succeeded to my C:\users\my name folder as Pictures system folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck. </p>

<h3> leontief  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 Pro XP Mode with greater than 4 cores of CPU installed</h2>
                    <p>There exists a small category of Windows 7 users in a particular cross section.&nbsp; Let section A be Win7 users with more than the standard 4 cores of CPU installed, in some cases many times more.&nbsp; Let section B be Win7 users with "legacy software".&nbsp; Note that
 "legacy software" includes not just old XP/32 software but also some advanced technical software for which the latest version is not stable on Win7 or Vista, and which also does not run on any operating system other than Windows.&nbsp; Persons residing in both
 section A and section B, hereby called the "cross-section", will need Win7 Pro XP mode.&nbsp; However, XP mode currently fails to install at the last step with no further comment or recommendation, for all persons in the cross-section AxB.&nbsp; There is a related hotfix
 KB2519949 that pertains only to the AMD 8-core Bulldozer chip series.&nbsp; Microsoft has stated that KB2519949 is highly instance specific, and issues a strong cautionary note.&nbsp; The hotfix may not work and may even be unstable on some systems.&nbsp; Miscrosoft states
 on the KB2519949 webpage that further research is needed.&nbsp; I need to install XP mode and the Virtual Machine on Win7 Pro with 2x Intel E5-2620 CPU (24 cores).&nbsp; I would accept that XP mode can run on only a subset of my CPU installation, but only provided that
 this does not affect my full CPU installation and usage on Win7 proper.&nbsp; This is part of my PhD research, and the problem has deadlines.</p>

            Hi BetsyMendoza1 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />If your hard drive light is constantly flashing leave it for a little longer.  If it is only intermittently flashing then force the machine to shut down and restart.
<br />You may need to create a recovery disk at this point if the restore point failed miserably. 
<br />See link to create a recovery disk.

<div>Your problem is very likely a hardware one, but read the following:</div>

    <title>Windows no longer recognizes my USB to Parallel cable - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows no longer recognizes my USB to Parallel cable</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit. I recently installed my HP Laserjet 5L printer using a USB to parallel cable. All was going well until I tried to print from Excel. Long story short, I "illegally" aborted the print job and from that point on the
 printer was seen as "offline."<br />
<br />
I've deleted the printer driver through the print management console, and I've narrowed down the cable drivers based on modified files on the date I first plugged in the cable. BUT ... I can't figure out how to delete these files so Windows will again "see"
 this cable and give me the option to created a USB virtual port for the HP printer.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help?<br />

            Thank you for your response. In response to your question, No, I did not receive any error messages, and I have already tried all your suggestions.
<br />
<br />
Based on your response, I believe I did not title my question properly. I know what I did to cause the problem which probably corrupted either the cable driver or the printer driver.
<br />
<br />
I want to uninstall both the cable driver and the printer. <br />
<br />
Deleting the printer package was accomplished in Print Management, but I can't figure out how to delete the cable driver, which initially appeared in Devices and Printers under Other Devices. Once I figure out how to do this, Windows should recognize the USB
 to parallel cable as a new device, and again install it under Other Devices. This will give me the option to created a USB virtual port on which to install my legacy HP printer.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have taken steps to insure I never make this mistake again.<br />

            <p>Are these the drives on which you were attempting to run chkdsk?&nbsp; If so, the problem may be with the electronics in the case rather than the drive itself.&nbsp; See, for example,
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-1979433/open-lacie-porsche-design-9230-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-1979433/open-lacie-porsche-design-9230-case.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If they both really failed completely at the same time, that's both unfortunate and unusual (unless there was some common external factor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although hdtune is a good utility, it still might be worth checking with Seatools (LaCie was bought by Seagate a few years ago) -- unless the drive is making strange noises when it is powered on; in that case, the more you do, the more data you will lose.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how much the data is worth to you, there are companies that specialize in recovering data from damaged drives.&nbsp; This service is not inexpensive.&nbsp; The best-known is probably
<a href="http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/welcome/welcome-to-drivesavers/?dsNum=24387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DriveSavers</a>, but there are many others, including one that says it specializes in
<a href="http://www.drivecrash.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LaCie drives</a>.&nbsp; Many will give you a free estimate of the cost to recover data.&nbsp; I don't have any personal experience with any of these companies and can't recommend any of them
 over the others.</p>

    <title>Terraria reverted back to trial version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverwing333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terraria reverted back to trial version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A while back my&nbsp;family got the $1 gold for 1 month, well Terraria was the free game of the month, so we go it. &nbsp;I don't remember how long it ago it was. &nbsp;But two days ago we bought a new xbox because ours was going to ****, and since then, I noticed Terraria went back to the trial version...even though we got the full for free.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did the license transfer and tried re-downloading them, didn't work. &nbsp;Same thing happened with Goat Simulator, of which we also got the full version for free. &nbsp;What should&nbsp;I do? &nbsp;All of our saved data and other stuff for terraria is still in our storage, but it's now under trial&nbsp;instead and telling us to unlock the full game. &nbsp;Is there any way I can fix this? &nbsp;I really don't feel like purchasing it again. &nbsp;And is it because it can't be transferred? &nbsp;A bunch of the other arcade games that went to trial, came back as full after the license transfer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Couldn't really find anything on google for it, so I decided to come here. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>My brother managed to get the full&nbsp;goat simulator version back, what even?<br />

It's likely that the games were purchased across a few accounts; if this is the case, all of the accounts would need to do a license transfer.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, if it's been done on several accounts, then you will want to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact us</a> via phone or chat support to have them look at the licenses on the accounts on your console to ensure one of them has Terraria.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me know how it goes!&nbsp;I'm happy to address any other concerns you guys might have if this doesn't sort you out. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

            Hi, #1Mamacita
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode with network function.
<br />
<br />To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off

            Hi Shelly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            bri35, you may need to specify the file type (or select All Files) from the drop down menu when attempting to insert your movie.<br />
Please see the following Microsoft Office Help articles for further assistance:<br />

Also confirm that the file is in fact in the location you have saved it in, and that it is playable.

<h2>            Explorer.exe memory leak&#33; Booted into safe mode and...</h2>
                    I just bought a new lenovo yoga 2 11 today and I installed webroot, Firefox and Microsoft office that's it. I ran webroot and it said explorer.exe has a memory leak. So I started my laptop into safe mode and guess what no more memory leak!! How do I fix
 this after I boot back into normal mode kind of lost after seeing the memory leak gone in safe mode. Right now I did a reset of windows 8.1 to factory settings to see if this will help. Please someone help me I already made an exchange today because of a broken
 hinge don't want to go back

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As this is a new computer, it might not be a case of memory leak as we get to see that there is no memory leak in Safe Mode. It might be a false notification from Webroot application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a precautionary measure you may follow all these methods one by one and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure to keep the computer up to date with all the updates. If you use automatic updating, you won't need to check for important and recommended updates at all. Windows Update will check for these updates and install them when they're ready.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't use automatic updating, you should check for updates yourself at least once every week. Microsoft usually releases important updates
 once a month. However, updates could be released at any time.</span></p>
<p><strong>Windows Update: Frequently Asked Questions</strong><span>: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious
 or unsafe driver you shouldn't install.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and install drivers: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool:</span></p>
<p><span>Press “Windows key + R” to get the run window.</span></p>
<p><span>Type “mdsched” and hit enter to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. Follow the on screen directions to run this tool and restart the computer to check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 4.</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the hard drive. Windows includes features to help optimize the different types of drives that
 PCs use today. No matter which type of drive your PC uses, Windows automatically chooses the optimization that's right for your drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned under “To repair a drive” from this article and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Improve performance by optimizing your hard drive</span></strong><span>:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Important</strong><span>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found, then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on that sector might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    My older versions of Print Shop 3.0 and Version 23 won't work with Windows 10.&nbsp; The new Print Shop software gets very, very low ratings.&nbsp; ( not worth buying)&nbsp; I need to be able to make calendars-small magnetic up to 8 x 11 single and double wall size,
 brochures, business cards, greeting cards, flyers, etc for my photography business.&nbsp; Any Windows Store suggestions or recommended apps?&nbsp; Thank you ahead of time for your input.&nbsp; &nbsp;
