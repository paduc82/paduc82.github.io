<h2>            Western Digital My Passport not recognized in Windows 10 FIX</h2>
                    <p>This fix worked:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Go to Western Digital and download the update file.&nbsp; Unplug all USB devices except mouse, keyboard and My Passport drive.&nbsp; Ensure the WD Passport drive is connected to the back of your computer, not
 a USB 3.0 port, but a backward compatible USB port with the same cable that came with the drive.&nbsp; The download is compressed, so create a folder, and then un-compress the new files there.&nbsp; Hopefully, once you run the update, Windows 10 wakes up, recognizes
 there is an external drive, and admits there is a problem.&nbsp; It should offer to fix the problem.&nbsp; Be nice and agree, leaving your comment to Bill Gates and associates for another time.&nbsp; Once this fix ran on my computer, Windows 10 suddenly said it found a drive
 in e:\, as after C: and a DVD drive in D:, e: is the port that runs your external Passport.&nbsp; My Passport was old (2006), and it is now nicely open and giving me access.&nbsp; This was good, as I'm a writer and I had a book on the e: drive...whether it's going to
 be a best seller is up to you, the public.&nbsp; If Black Knight: Nebulous Dawn is on a shelf, buy...it will give D. Fitzgerald enough money to care for an ailing mother...truly.&nbsp; hope this helps, I was out of options until this worked like magic for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am
 an A+ certified&nbsp;computer technician, and this new world of apps and WiFi is troubling, but also amazing...just know the tricks.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has to be given the right instructions, and using the search web/windows link in the task bar is helpful...just type "troubleshooter" and it pops up and looks at your computer.&nbsp; It is an
 okay OS when properly told what to do, and it does have backward compatible features that need to be turned on for older devices to use...older devices do NOT work on USB 3.0, but most new computers have a few USB 2.0 ports that will work on older application.</span></p>

            Can you advise (more specifically) the &nbsp;Western Digital update are you referring to? &nbsp;Their site basically states they don't provide drivers, have been thinking that MS 10 simply has none for the old Passport. &nbsp;(Reminds me of the old unsupported printer
 days.)

            <p>I tried Googling "Update for Passport for Windows 10"...what they sent me worked...I'll see if I still have it and send it to you...I'll look now.</p>
<p>I found the update, it just says "WDFirmwareUpdater" and had a folder named Ref.</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe just google that and it will show up...or<br />

    <title>USB Flash Drive Doesn&#39;t have a driver. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel gomez 2001  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Flash Drive Doesn&#39;t have a driver.</h2>
                    <p>By using the "Disk Cleanup" tool provided, I accidentally deleted something I shouldn't have. I read, thinking I fully understood, and ended up deleting the USB Flash Driver for my computer. I have tried multiple ways to retrieve it such as:<br />
</p>
<p>-Going to "Recovery": Didn't ever enable this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using the Virtual Agent: To find resources about my issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Troubleshooting: The software attempts to replace the missing driver but doesn't (attempted multiple times including after restart)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Searching for more information online: Everything that seemed legit wanted money so I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Going to "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20034": The "Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager" was downloaded from the page. When executed it said that the setup required the ".NET Framework version 1.1.4322". It gave me an option Yes
 or No to go online and fix it. "The .NET Framework can be obtained from the web. Would you like to do this now?". I clicked Yes and it took me to: "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9832". This didn't work:
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ea9c243-0748-49c1-bbdd-2fcc1aeb5b4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ea9c243-0748-49c1-bbdd-2fcc1aeb5b4a" /></a></p>
<p>Manually, I searched for ".NET Framework version 1.1.4322" on the Microsoft website. Finding it I attempted to download, but my current version denied it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Edition is "Windows 8.1 with Bing"</p>
<p>I am using an HP Stream</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all that information, my question is:<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me out or point me in a new direction to reinstall this driver?</p>

            <p>Hi Suvarna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have problems with win10 &nbsp;recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to recover windows from the image, created on the external drive (WD My Passport). Recovery failed with the notice, that there is no access... , shows error 0x80070005, and that I have to turn off Antivirus program.</p>
<p>So I turned it off without any results - the same notice.</p>
<p>After that I run sfc/scannow, which did not find any problem and Microsoft Safety Scanner which also did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this I found out that there is a problem just to create a Restore Point - after a few days these points are gone. The same thing happens with the Restore Points created after windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use path, proposed by Jessen P (see above) Windows Logo + E, but could not find any
<strong>Tools</strong> menu</p>
<p>and Show Hidden Files and Folders in<strong> View</strong> menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any ideas.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

    <title>Wolfenstein Games Ranked from Worst to Best - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wolfenstein Games Ranked from Worst to Best</h2>
                    
<p>Here's my rank list from worst to best Wolfenstein games so far:</p>
<p>- Wolfenstein (2009) = Reason: Huge disappointment, didn't liked this one that much. The campaign was very mediocre at best &amp; the multiplayer was awful. The voice-acting &amp; plot are subpar as well. Raven Software did no justice to the franchise, this mediocre
 to poor installment deserves to be forgotten.</p>
<p>- Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001/2003) = Reason: An alright at best installment, again the multiplayer was terrible, but the campaign is decent to alright here. The voice-acting is still subpar, but the plot is okay though. This installment was mostly
 meant to reboot the franchise back in the 6th generation, it was a mild to moderate success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Wolfenstein 3D (1992) = Reason: The game that created and started the FPS genre, still to this day its a fun nice game, the graphics are good for its time, the music is decent and the plot is okay at best. One major flaw with this title though is the somewhat
 repetitive level design.</p>
<p>- Wolfenstein The Old Blood (2015) = Reason: A prequel to last year's The New Order, this installment is just as great as The New Order was but almost awesome.... almost. The music here is pretty forgettable at best, but everything else was great from even
 better graphics (thanks to being exclusive to next gen only), great story, superb voice-acting, and great gameplay.</p>
<p>- Wolfenstein The New Order (2014) = Reason: The near-perfect installment &nbsp;to the franchise, last year this game was somewhat try to reboot the series again, but this time, Bethesda is involved (developed by a Swedish subsidiary studio for Bethesda, MachineGames),
 and Bethesda has done a near perfect job with this one, much better than what Activision did. Good graphics, great music, superb voice-acting, great gameplay, and good story.</p>

<p>What's your rank from worst to best Wolfenstein games?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Tablet Mode often doesn&#39;t load start screen at log-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam z lein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Tablet Mode often doesn&#39;t load start screen at log-in</h2>
                    <p>Often when logging into my Microsoft ID account on Windows 10 on the Surface Pro 2 when set to Tablet Mode, after log-in I only see the taskbar and a blank screen (faded dark desktop background image).&nbsp; It's supposed to load the full screen start screen
 with all of my tiles.&nbsp; This is what it looks like when I log in:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57c568a8-0c29-4295-9095-6b3492535aff" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a completely new user (named TEST) with no Microsoft ID associated with it, then the problem does not happen. It logs into the full start screen correctly.&nbsp; To troubleshoot, I then deleted my primary account from the Surface Pro 2 so that only
 the TEST account remained.&nbsp; Then I re-added the primary Microsoft ID account in order to create a fresh non-corrupt profile in Windows 10.&nbsp; The problem went away UNTIL after it synchronized all of my settings with whatever cloud the Microsoft ID is storing
 them in.&nbsp; Now the problem has resurfaced. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed most non-essential non-Microsoft start-up apps and services, so I don't believe there is a conflict with anything 3rd party.&nbsp; I have not done a "Reset" yet because I don't want to reinstall all of my programs and besides I don't think the problem
 is with the software since adding a fresh user account and logging into that doesn't have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Touching the blank area of the screen will load the full Start screen by the way. It just doesn't load after logging in which is a bit annoying.&nbsp; Anyone else see this problem?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Update Errors 57A and 643</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to install my updates for about a week now and I simply can't.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to install my updates (27 for Microsoft Office 2013 and 1 for Microsoft Silverlight) i get two errors- 57A and 643.</p>
<p>I spent many hours searching for a solution to my problem,</p>
<ul>
<li>I made sure that I have all the permissions needed,</li><li>I rebooted my computer several times,</li><li>I have tried to fix my registry using RegClean but it did nothing.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I would be very grateful if someone helps me, because it seems like I can`t help myslef anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much,</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Khaled,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I can understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may face this issue due to corruption in window update components.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As a first step, try disconnecting all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard (If you have connected any external devices).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try following the methods below in order to get the updates installed successfully.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Run windows update trouble shooter</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Windows update trouble shooter provides the solution to some common problems with installing updates. And it tries to fix problems automatically</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still persists try method 2</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>You may try to reset the Windows Update components and then try to install the Windows Updates.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Refer: How do I reset Windows Update components?
</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:
</span></strong><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you
 follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue didn’t get resolve try method 3.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform clean boot.
</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Try to install updates in clean
 boot state and check</span></span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a USB stick for example. You should just go to the manufactures website of that desktop for example, search the model, and download the driver to the USB stick (on a working computer ) and install from USB and so on the affected one.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If it’s a custom build, you would need to know the motherboard make, Search on that manufactures site the same way (unless you have the motherboard disc).</p>

    <title>Xbox One Onlineverbindung geht nicht - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Onlineverbindung geht nicht</h2>
                    
<p>Kann mir wer helfen?</p>
<p>Ich hab folgendes Problem.Wenn ich mich mit meinem Wlan verbinde steht dann da, dass meine Konsole mit dem Internet verbunden ist, und wenn ich die Multiplayer-Verbindung teste steht auch da, "mit der Multiplayer-Verbindung sind keine Probleme aufgetreten".
 Aber wenn ich dann z.B: Black Ops 3 spielen will steht dann "versuchen sie es erneut oder öffnen sie die app lokal". Der Store lässt sich auch nicht öffnen und ich kann nicht sehen ob Freunde online sind. Andere Spiele die eine online Verbindung brauchen funktionieren
 auch nicht.</p>
<p>Was kann ich machen?</p>

<p>Hast Du schon mal einen Hardreset bei der Konsole durchgeführt? </p>
<p>Halte mal den Xbox Logo Sensor Button rechts an der Konsole für etwa 15 Sekunden gedrückt, und prüfe, dass die Netzteil LED orange wird.
</p>
<p>Wenn ja, ziehe das Stromkabel der Konsole und warte etwa 30 Sekunden. </p>
<p>Dann wieder alles einstecken und Konsole starten. </p>

<h2>            No Master Audio HD or Dolby Digital HD on XBox One.</h2>
                    
<p><span>My son just purchased an XBox One, it took about 1 hr to do full set up &amp; install Forza, fairly simple. I am SOOOOOOOOOO disappointed with MS. I put in Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray disk to see how it looks and sounds. I noticed the Blu-Ray player does
 not play Dolby TrueHD &amp; DTS-HD Master Audio. What a HUGE mistake. So I either have to use my PS3 or go out and buy a Blu-Ray player now if I want to be able to watch those movies and utilize those features built in the Blu-Ray disks. I don't get it, the Xbox
 One is suppose to be All in one entertainment system for our living rooms, but you skimp on what a Home Theater is all about.</span></p>

<p>You can get dts hd audio but I was told by the support tech that at this time support for Dolby isnt there yet but will be eventually. &nbsp; I agree with ur disappointment. &nbsp;How can u say its a next gen system when it can't do half the things that the current
 gen did, ps3 included. &nbsp;I made the choice to purchase the xbox one first because of the multimedia features alone. &nbsp;When I purchase my ps4 which will probably be 2014 holiday season I have a feeling my xbox one will just collect dust...</p>

<p>It's laughable how they marketed it as a media hub in your living room that it does everything similar to how Sony marketed the PS3 and it can't even play the HD codecs on the blu-rays which is a complete joke and they had the cheek to launch even expensive
 than the PS4.</p>

    <title>Printer problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-264  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer problems</h2>
                    <p>In January&nbsp; I purchased a new computer with Windows&nbsp;10 loaded and connected via Wi fi to my existing Canon MP560 printer&nbsp;(&nbsp;a few years old now). All worked well until last week. Then for some reason following a&nbsp; windows update ( I hate those things) it decided
 not to print any Excel worksheets or Word documents or items from websites. When trying to print, the paper whizz through the printer at a great rate of knots but with nothing printed.&nbsp;But perversely it did print photo's. So I knew the printer was connected
 and was recognized by the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the computer to an earlier restore point&nbsp;that I knew the printer was working OK. I also uninstalled the printer and re-installed it. As it was an old printer it identified that the drivers were out of date and&nbsp;installed new drivers automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Neither of these action seemed to work, but they might have done because&nbsp;I then decided to do a thorough clean of the printer via the printers maintenance programs. I had to run the programs a couple of times to get the colours up to standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not expecting much after that, I tried printing out some worksheets and documents and hey presto everything work fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am keeping my fingers crossed that it keeps working.&nbsp; I hope this helps others with the same problems, it worth a try you never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Write Protection Removal from USB flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Write Protection Removal from USB flash drive</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Write Protection Removal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since it's an<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> established fact</span> that Win7 is incapable of removing the write protection from a pendrive., I'd like to see if a different approach is feasible? Could I go into the "partition" and either alter
 it (resize?) or re-partition it to where it would make the drive altoghther a new, unused/open partition?
<em>If possible</em>, how do I go about this process? I'm thinking that re-sizing/re-allocating the drive, it would "wipe" it clean and from there I could use it as it originally operated...i.e. in read/write mode!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustrated @ Win7:</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I see that you are not able to remove the write protection from the USB flash drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To answer your query: Yes, you can format the pen drive, create new partition and use it without right protected). However, before doing that let's try these steps below to remove Write protection from your USB drive.
</strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>Please follow the method given below to “<strong>remove write protection from Pen drive</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
a. Open start menu, in the search bar type regedit and press enter. This will open the registry editor.<br />
<br />
b. Navigate to the following path:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: <br />
</strong>If the registry key StorageDevicePolicies does not exist, you will need to create it manually.<br />
c. Highlight StorageDevicePolicies, and then create a New DWORD (32-bit) Value named as WriteProtect.<br />
d. Double click the key WriteProtect in the right window and set the value to 0 in the Value<br />
Data Box and press OK button<br />
e. Restart your computer and try copying files into your USB drives.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article: Back up the registry in Windows 7</span></p>

            <p>Sir:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With all due respect, I don't believe there is a MSWin "<em>solution</em>" that I've NOT tried. Including, but not limited to, your suggestion. I've also tried 3 different software programs that also failed. The drive just refuses to be written to. I
 have one other application to try and I'll note the results in this thread.(if it succeeds) I would be interested in your method of "creating a new partition" for the one MSWin 7 uses would not work... guess what, got a pop-up that said "unable to perform
 task for disc is write protected". Perhaps your way of creating a new partition is different from MSW 7?</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried every "method" I could find to correct this curse using MSWin7. I have tried the operations you ( and many others) suggested and they've failed. I tried"LINUX", and also, got same results. I tried to re-partition on both MSWin &amp; Linux and
 got the same response..."Cannot perform operation due to 'write protection". Yes, I about fell over when I couldn't re-partition for you
<em>SHOULD</em> be able to perform that function irregardless of the "write protection". I need to find out how pendrives incorporate the "write protection" into their MBR and /or opening files and figure out how to "reverse" that process. Could you offer any
 assistance in that procedure? I do NOT want to trash the pendrive for &nbsp;I only been using it about 4 months and it worked perfectly before it was cursed with the WP. I came to this forum because I had been using it (the pendrive) in a Win7 machine prior to
 it, somehow, acquiring the WP. I DID NOT INSTALL THE WRITE PROTECTION !!! And, I'd like to stress...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I don't believe there is a procedure associated with Win7 that I haven't tried!</span>&nbsp;Please, someone has to know what
 this problem is and how to correct it. Would it be too much to propose this "situation" to your colleagues and see if any of them are aware of the problems and/or it's possible cure?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Refresh from bootable media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colingyoung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Refresh from bootable media</h2>
                    <p>It seems I got a pretty bad virus. &nbsp;Here's what's happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Computer hung when it went to sleep and would not wake up.</p>
<p>-Cold booted. &nbsp;When Windows 10 started, none of the apps that normally start would start. &nbsp;All gave errors.</p>
<p>-No apps except Windows apps work, and not even all of those</p>
<p>-Tried to do a refresh, but it can't - seems like my Win 10 installation files are missing.</p>
<p>-Don't have installation media. &nbsp;Upgrade from 8.1 was forced on me by download</p>
<p>-Tried (via Edge instead of Chrome) dowloading and using the refresh tool. &nbsp;Same error comes up when I try to run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to refresh Windows 10 from bootable media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not - what other solution is there to refresh Windows 10 in light of the fact that I don't have installation media - and possibly will need to re-download it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another problem a couple months ago and got EXCELLENT assistance from Pa Bear Dyer - I hope he sees this post too!</p>

<p>Thanks for the info, but I'm a little leery of editing the registry.<br />

<p>In addition, I'm leery of a website that advertises lots of PUPs.</p>

</p><p>I'm also pretty amazed that Microsoft doesn't have a more straightforward way to do this than editing the registry.</p>

    <title>3 xbox one consoles on a single gold account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fluffy the meek  say:</h3>
<h2>            3 xbox one consoles on a single gold account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>We are thinking of adding a 3rd Xbox one console to our house so myself and my kids can all play together at the same time, specifically the games&nbsp;that don't have split screen but do have multi-player. We&nbsp;prefer to buy the digital copy of the game and share the gaming experience across our LAN. Is it possible to connect a 3rd console without adding another Xbox live gold account and can we play together on the same network without buying multiple copies of the same game?</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>That was a really good explanation, thank you. I was hoping to&nbsp;expand our gaming opportunities, looks like we will stick with&nbsp;the two consoles and games that offer split screen. Again, thanks for taking the time and providing clear information.</p><p><br /></p>

And I just wanted to tell Microsoft that your company and your products are rip offs, you people are making money hand over fist, you could make a better product than you do. But I plan to complain to as many organization's as I possibly can. BBB, consumer protection agency, Department of justice, and there are a lot of other organizations on my list. I am waging war on your company and it's people. So here comes a lot at you!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Ryse Son Of Rome Multiplayer</h2>
                    Hi as im being ignored on twitter by Crytek and Ryse son of Rome I thought I would see if I could get ignored on the Xbox forum as well. I am finding it almost impossible to get a multiplayer match in Ryse it doesn't matter if I go into quick match or
 custom it just sits there searching and searching and searching and searching this is really starting to p*** me off. I've tried everything I can think of to sort it I.E reset my internet turned the Xbox off at the wall even checked my multiplayer in the settings
 and it says its all good. So can anybody help or tell me what's going on or is this the new Xbox live service pot luck weather you can get a game in Ryse or BF4

<p>I haven't tried the multiplayer for this game yet. If you've tried all of the troubleshooting tips though, it could be that there might not be anybody playing the multiplayer part of the game. It happens sometimes. Even if it's a new game and people don't
 like it that much. The population dies down. I would say just keep trying and maybe you'll get lucky.</p>

<p>I've had no problems with the Ryse multiplayer, it could be that you've just been unlucky so far. Have you installed the game update? You could always add me and see if that works with Ryse? BF4 has had some serious server issues and joining games on that
 have been difficult but patches and patience should sort that out!;-)</p>

<p>Have you tested your connection? &nbsp;Also have you tried playing online in another game? &nbsp;Also Hard restart your system by holding the lit up Xbox symbol on the front of the console for about 8 seconds, give it 5 min then turn it on again. &nbsp;Also try disconnecting

 hibernates and wakes up&nbsp;internet still works.&nbsp; If I reboot the reboot again&nbsp;- it is back to no internet until I do the magic network adapter disable/enable again.&nbsp; I also notice that after reboot as I logon and observe the network icon in the system tray -
 I see a red "x" for a slplit second before the icon becomes "normal" and says I have internet access when I mouse over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading all the posts on the internet I have tried the following things already with no solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Booted in safe mode with networking </p>
<p>2. Booted with selective services only (only Microsoft services, all other including Bonjour, etc. disabled)</p>
<p>3. Tried both NIC ports</p>
<p>4. Tried different network cables</p>
<p>5. Upgraded the NIC drivers to the latest version</p>
<p>6. Reset the TCP/IP stack (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</font></a>)</p>
<p>7. Disabled all power management under NIC adapter properties<br />
</p>
<p>The fact that I still have the problem in safe mode (and selective startup) - seems to indicate that the issue is due to some Windows component and not due to any other installed&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very frustrated.&nbsp; Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi, you are not helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem and find here two very similar post and both not worked - you only write to use troubleshooter. Yes its not a big problem, but we are your customers who bought your product and You it seems dont care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should consider at least some reaction like how it happens or what have you tried. The troubleshooter doesnt work - thats sure if this topic opens up again and again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope You will do something about it.</p>

            Have you tried uninstalling the ethernet adapter and then scanning for hardware changes in device manager? That should clean install the ethernet drivers and services

<p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this error occurs on your computer is because of a system conflict with a device driver. You can follow the steps on the link below to roll back the driver to it's previous version and see if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be able to check all the details on how to perform the action through this

link</a>. We also suggest that you download the Show or hide updates troubleshooter to prevent the problem driver from updating automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>

<p>From Microsoft</p>
<p>We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some
<strong>AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series</strong> adapters. The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for
<strong>all versions of Windows 10</strong> to delete the <strong>22.19.128.0 driver</strong> from the system and recover the recommended driver version (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start <strong>Device Manager</strong>. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> icon, and then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>, and <strong>right-click</strong> the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and verify driver version is <strong>22.19.128.0</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall Device</strong>.</li><li>Check the box that says, "<strong>Delete the driver software for this device.</strong>” This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.</li><li>The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select any device, then click <strong>Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</li><li>If the recommended driver (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>) is re-installed and this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here. (Repeat steps 1-3 to verify that the correct driver version is installed). Otherwise follow the next step to check for
 the driver using Windows Update.</li><li><strong>Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security</strong>, then
<strong>Check for updates</strong> and install any available updates.</li></ol>

    <title>&#34;this folder is empty&#34; error win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> penwick  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;this folder is empty&#34; error win 7</h2>
                    I have a USB HDD in which many folders are reported by Win 7 Professional 64bit ( a very new clean machine) as 'this folder is empty' when it isn't<br />
<br />
Copying a folder with this problem to the desktop doesn't change anything, but another Win 7 machine, 32 bit, sees the files OK.&nbsp; Copying them to another drive with that machine doesn't help.<br />
<br />
<br />
The folder properties shows 'Read only' but not 'Hidden' and changing 'Read only' doesn't stick - the properties come up the same afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
ChkDsk finds no errors.<br />
<br />
So it's not the drive, not the USB path, and I'm stuck!<br />
<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the USB Hard disk? </li><li>When you check the properties of the folder, what does it show? </li><li>On the second computer, when you try to copy the files to another driver, what happens? Does it display any error message or code?
