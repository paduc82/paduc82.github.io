<h2>            update kb936357  causing pentium 4  Hyper Threading freeze lock up problems&#63;</h2>
                    after installing update kb936357 from windows update (high priority update) my computer locks up at shut down. Also runs slower. Is this a known issue with pentium 4 HT processors? I found people on Google with same issue. Update is aimed at dual core
 procs. The P4 with Hyper Threading looks like a&nbsp;dual core but does not need this update. But my PC wants to install it. It is also in SP3. So I cant use SP3 or turn on automatic updates. Is Microsoft aware of this issue? Is there a fix?

<h2>            XBOX ONE Factory Reset does not work.</h2>
                    <p>I don't quite know how it got to this state, but I believe my console is dead. After a lengthy battle with this thing, it will not properly turn on. I press the power button, and nothing will happen with it. The light turns on and that is it. It doesn't even make a sound like the hard drive is being read. Before anyone tells me to factory reset it, I already have tried. I plug the USB in, which is formatted correctly and has the correct reset file, and also only has that file, then follow the reset steps exactly to no avail. I press and hold the EJECT and BIND button, then tap the power button and continue to hold the former two buttons, but no start up tones happen. At first I thought it was an HDMI cable issue, but someone suggested just to stream my XBOX's display to the app, which made complete sense since there would be no cables involved, but the app cannot even detect my XBOX on the WIFI network, meaning the system processes must not even be starting!

    <title>System sounds schemes not working on Windows 8 laptop after fully - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverdoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            System sounds schemes not working on Windows 8 laptop after fully upgraded  from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>As the title stated, I've upgraded my Win 7 laptop with Windows 8 Pro from Dreamspark (MSDNAA). I also did a clean Windows 8 Pro installation on my PC. All is fine on my PC. But on my laptop, the
<strong>system sounds</strong> scheme is muted, even&nbsp;though&nbsp;the volume of <strong>
system sounds</strong> at 100%. The notification sounds of Metro apps are muted, too. When I open the
<em>Sounds Panel</em>, al the sounds preview worked fine (both the default &amp; custom schemes carried from Windows 7). Also I check the "play Windows startup sound" &amp; it did play every time I start Windows. All other audio from music, video, game&nbsp;apps, Internet,
 YouTube, Flash worked fine, only the system sound schemes are muted. The audio files themselves are all good, not corrupted, the
<strong>system sounds</strong>&nbsp;volume even&nbsp;turned on when I previewed those&nbsp;files on
<em>Sounds Panel</em>. But when I actually did things like navigating in <em>File Explorer</em>, connecting USB devices, emptying recycled bin, there were simply no sound. I don't know if the problem is with my local&nbsp;account from Windows 7 now being upgraded
 &amp; linked with my <em>Microsoft</em>&nbsp;account, since I heard people having the same problem &amp; had to create a brand new account for. Maybe there's something wrong with the admin permissions that prevent the audio to trigger when the events happen. There's nothing
 wrong with audio driver since I upgraded to the latest <em>Realtek HD&nbsp;2.70</em> ( support Win 8) on both my laptop &amp; PC, worked fine on PC &amp; except for this very problem, worked fine with any other audio source on my laptop. Please help. Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S: My laptop is a 2-pt touchscreen from 2010, but still usable with the new Start screen. Just info, doubt it has anything to do with this problem. Though I found it less intuitive on desktop than Win 7. In Windows 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;you actually can swipe &nbsp;to go back
 &amp; forth in Explorer, 2-finger touch&nbsp;for right click (rather than just&nbsp;hold finger), the touch keyboard even had words suggestion like WP7.&nbsp;None of&nbsp;them works&nbsp;in Windows 8's desktop. Just enhance the desktop to be more touch optimized, since now the Metro UI&nbsp;is
 fully developed. Just sayin'. Rather than that, I'm loving it, especially on my PC since it run so fast without any hitch!</p>

<h2>            Device manager does not ask for UAC prompt</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Professional x64 SP1. Recently I have noticed that Device Manager does not ask for UAC prompt (if I run it from administrator, it works fine; if I run it from user account, it just shows notification window saying that I have logged in
 as user, and that if I want to change something I have to log in as administrator).<br />
<br />
As far as I remember, it used to ask for UAC prompt before. I couldn't find any setting to alter this behavior.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to enable UAC prompt to get administrative privileges when I run Device Manager? What behavior is expected by default?<br />
<br />

            You need to create a shortcut to devmgmt.msc on the desktop, then click it with your right mouse button and click "Run as Administrator" so that you get prompted for an admin account and password. This is the default behaviour for non-admin accounts.<br />

<p>Ok I was able to boot up my old pc which has xp and was the only way I could see that you had repiled to this .
</p>
<p>Now I would love to know what email programme you think I should use . Is the Microsoft email free now and not still bundled with office ??? Please do not suggest outlook (ex hotmail ) Or g mail or yahoo mail I want to be able to have a server address and
 to be able to open that . To start with i did not have problems with windows 10 and Incredimail but now its not working. Maybe your answer was fueled by a few pre New Years&nbsp; drinks or just not well thought out . I have been a huge supporter of every thing
 Microsoft for years and would expect maybe a slightly more helpful answer , not one that is tinged with what&nbsp; I&nbsp; feel is sarcasm and not helpful at all .

            <p>Incredimail is a toy, not a serious email programme. It caused a lot of performance related issues on Windows 7. I am not surprised that you are having problems on Windows 10. I will leave others to make suggestions regarding a more suitable replacement.</p>

Thanks well regardless of Incredimail is a toy, not a serious email programme I like it plus it is a **** of a lot cheaper then paying for the microsoft one bundled with office at How much per year ?? I really do not want all the programmes in office and would
 like to make a suggestion . How about making a menu price for me that would be word and email client I would be happy to pay for that rather then pay for a lot of things like excel etc that i would never use but thanks for telling me what to do and the only
 way I could have answered you on this was cause i had found that fix before i came to post this . I am a wee bit worried of course with not having that adobe patch . Is that patch only if i use edge or IE Happy New year Gerry :)&nbsp;

<p>Why does Microsoft advertise PC cleaner as "FREE" when it is NOT...it is the same nuisance i just got rid of but trusted Microsoft‚Äôs claim that it is good and it is FREE..</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Several months ago, I tried the pc cleaner you advertise as one of your products...I thought it was supposed to be free, but I found it was a "buy"...after I decided to try the "free" pc cleaner, I received a warning that there were "2,000+ errors on my
 computer"...I had a tech look at my computer and there were nowhere near 2,000 errors...not only that but I found at least 2 warnings a day even after he cleaned up the minor ones that were there...I tried to uninstall pc cleaner and it was virtually impossible
 to do so...he came again and uninstalled it for me...why was that so difficult...nothing he did was that involved, I just wanted to be secure about this problem...I think this is poor marketing...</p>

<h3> silentstick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Family keeps locking me out, although I am no longer part of the Microsoft family and the restrictions were removed.</h2>
                    <p>On Friday, May 24, I graduated high school and my parents fulfilled their promise of removing the restrictions from my microsoft account and removing the time restrictions they had set. It would lock me out at 11:00 every night. Anyway, they as well got
 me a laptop which is linked to my acct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, two times, I have now experienced it locking me out at the strangest times of the day. Such as Friday, it locked me out at 2:45 P.M. And today, June 3, it locked me out at 2:59 P.M. I would call my parents to inquire about it yet they had done nothing
 to lock me out. What is happening? How do I get it to stop? I had to use a parents' laptop to send in this question. It's honestly quite frustrating. The restrictions are gone. Why is it still locking me out?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It would suggest one of two things, the account if a Family Account or the NTUser.dat file is corrupt.
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />
<br />Change the date of birth on your Microsoft Account to ensure it reflects your are 18 years or older:
<br />
<br />Change the birthdate on your Microsoft account - Microsoft Support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/microsoft-account-change-birthdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: 
<br />
<br />If the other account is setup as a family account, sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.
<br />
<br />Change the account privilege 
<br />
<br />It is possible there is a profile issue, you could try changing the account privileges to Standard User from Administrator to see if it logs you in.
<br />
<br />In your current account
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Users tab
<br />Select the account, then click Disconnect
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the other account
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Group Membership
<br />Select Standard user
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK again
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, the try logging into the account. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, then it suggest NTUser.dat might be corrupt. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type view advanced system settings
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under User Profiles, click Settings
<br />For the affected profile, click Delete
<br />
<br />Select your user profile or another user profile that is able to log on successfully. 
<br />Click Copy To..
<br />Click Browse then save it somewhere on your drive
<br />Rename it to something else
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; system drive where Windows is installed
<br />Open the Users folder
<br />Open the troubled profiled
<br />Go to the View tab, then check off Hidden items in Show/Hide
<br />
<br />The NTUser.dat with backed up earlier, copy it into this folder
<br />
<br />Restart, then check if you can log in.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
This error message only appear if safely eject the device is selected and then tried to run the troubleshooter</p>
<p>I suggest that you follow the below steps:<br />
1. Restart the computer with the device being connected to the computer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Once the computer restarts without opening the contents, eject the device and check if it fixes the issue.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

No, this doesn't resolve the issue because, 1) I have no idea what "<span>Safe Removal tool" you are talking about or what that even is. 2) If I wish to eject a CD from the drive, of course I have to press the physical eject
 button--that's how the drive works! So this "cause" makes no sense. 3) On the "General" tab, there is no option to click anything other than the "Close" button.&nbsp; There is no "Troubleshooting" -- the word does not exist in that tab.<br />
<br />
As for suggestions to restarting the computer with the "device attached" ... the "device" is built in and I've restarted the computer many, many times since the CD/DVD drive ceased working. Nothing changes. Weird is the fact that I very rarely ever use the
 CD/DVD drive and haven't lately when suddenly there's an error message about it when I'm trying to debug how come "SearchFilterHost.exe" is suddenly "terminated" which I didn't do, and searching on the topic sends me down this rabbit hole to check properties
 on each drive!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am so sick of Microsoft's "solutions" just being meaningless and even whenever I do find a Troubleshoot button to press and run, it NEVER finds anything!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thoroughly frustrated? Yeah, you bet.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Movie Maker uses your system fonts, so all you need to do is install new fonts and they'll appear in the list of available fonts in Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft hasn't published a way to extend the transitions or the auto-movie themes. Thus nobody has created any additional transitions, effects, titles or themes. Nor has Microsoft added any. What you see in the program is what you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is in contrast to the prior version of Movie Maker (<a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>) where you could add

<p>I have used several different head phone sets, each one works well on other devices (e.g., my iphone, my windows phone). They also work when i am playing music on my Surface Pro 3. Just now i was listening to music on the surface pro 3 using Groove media
 player, the music played no problem on the computer speakers, i then plugged in the headphones and the music switched over to the headphones, i then unplugged the headphones and the system switched the music back to the computer speakers</p>
<p>it might be worth noting that i had the same problem when using skype in my MacBook air.</p>

<h2>            Automatic Repair Windows 10</h2>
                    Each time I start my laptop after seeing Windows 10 icon in middle of the screen "Preparing Automatic Repair" appears as though something will happen but shortly a blank screen results. It sounds like something is processing but no matter how long I leave
 my laptop no further messages appear. If I ultimately turn off the laptop, give it time before restarting all above happens again. I've gone through this routine a number of times with no different result. Effectively my laptop is useless until I can somehow
 bypass the Preparing Automatic Repair. Can someone help me please.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.

            Hi John,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>Hi Gary!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in my problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I turn on my other computer, I start with a grey screen that eventually becomes A W10 screen with the words Preparing Automatic Repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soon after the tumbling dots commence, but nothing further happens until the screen suddenly returns to grey. Simultaneously a white rectangular shape briefly appears around the outer edges of the grey screen. That's it then. I'm left with the grey screen
 only and all processing seems to cease.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course there is no Automatic Repair screen and therefore no opportunity to press the Advanced Options button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the Bios utility by pressing F2 just after turning on the computer. This utility setup is InsydeH20, Rev 3.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I follow the path of creating an installation media, I have no Product Key to insert as W10 on that computer is a free upgrade from W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As late as 5 days ago, I could still receive updates from Microsoft and the last one seems to have caused my present problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way I have no Wi-Fi since the start of this problem.</p>

            First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<h2>            windows store not opening in windows 8, after error code 0x80072f92</h2>
                    I have windows 8, since March 2013.&nbsp; I love it, but now I can't get into the app store, it is pinned to start,&nbsp; but when I click on it, it comes up but collapses back down.&nbsp; None of my other apps work, &nbsp;i.e. weather, Skype, video, internet explorer.&nbsp; I
 click on them and get nothing.&nbsp; I uninstalled my anti-virus, ran a command prompt to clear cache, but there was no cache to clean.&nbsp; I ran windows app troubleshooter, restarted my computer (several times), it found errors, but when the computer restarts, it's
 always the same, no apps.&nbsp; I also did a system restore which didn't take and a system recovery which failed also.&nbsp;&nbsp; Help!!!!!&nbsp; I want to update to windows 8.1, but can't with no store.

<h2>            How Much RAM Can Windows 2000 Support&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I'm trying to get my old computer to work again. It has Windows 2000 Professional installed on it, with a Pentium 4 2.66 GHz processor in it, with 1.25 GB of RAM installed. But it only shows that it has 256 MB of RAM installed. The computer used to
 run XP, and it recognized all of the RAM I have installed. Any ideas of what could be causing this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    <title>Font size problems in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxyeremin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font size problems in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I noticed Windows 10 occasionally messes up the sizes of fonts within the apps. I would be&nbsp;reading something, then go somewhere else, then come back to the same app, the fonts would be smaller, hard to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I was not sure, thinking I must be imaging things, but this behavior is confirmed. Can this be fixed? It is quite frustrating, and making the system almost unusable.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 installing loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomahaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installing loop</h2>
                    After looking at numerous posts, none were quite like mine. I tried to reset my computer using windows 10, while re-installing the power went out for the rest of the night. This morning I turned on my computer to be prompted with a "things were corrupted,
 press ok to have windows 10 installed." &nbsp;I kept pressing ok and it looped so I eventually turned to an online post which had me press SHIFT+F11 and change the startup value from 1 to 3. Now all my computer does is start up, flash the screen that windows 10
 is installing at 64% and then restart again. I've inserted a USB that has windows 7 on it and my computer won't recognize it. It won't let me into hyperdrive or BIOS. I'm really worried about if this can be fixed. I don't care about my files anymore. I just
 want my computer to work properly again.&nbsp;
