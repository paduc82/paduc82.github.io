    <title>Accidentally deleted a folder from the navigation pane... no delete - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Accidentally deleted a folder from the navigation pane... no delete confirmation box&#63;</h2>
                    I accidentally deleted a folder from the navigation pane in Windows Explorer, using the Delete key, not realizing that the focus was over there and not over on the side where the files are. After I hit Delete, there was no confirmation box or anything,
 the entire folder just disappeared instead of the selected files inside the folder. Fortunately, I was able to use a file recovery program to recover a few of the documents I wanted to keep, but not all of them
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't seem to reproduce the problem though. This has happened once before, but it only deleted a folder from a library. That time, I simply re-added the folder to the library. This time, it deleted the folder without confirmation from my hard drive completely.</div>

                </div>

<p><span><span><span>Hi ajg0001,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can customize several things about deleting files and the Recycle Bin settings.&nbsp; It’s possible that the delete confirmation dialog
 has been disabled.&nbsp; You can also set it to where the deleted files do not get moved to the recycle bin and are deleted immediately.&nbsp; Please see the below link for details on how it works and how to change it:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also, after the file was deleted, did you check to see if the file was in the recycle bin to be recovered?&nbsp; Here is a link with further
 information about recovering files from the recycle bin as well:</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 red Middle Light</h2>
                    
<p>I just turned my Xbox 360 on today and noticed that when I turn it on, it makes a really loud noise (Sounds like it's overheating) then the button you press to turn it on which is normally green, is red. There is no red rings, I've had those before this
 is only the middle light is red. I don't know what this means can anybody help me?</p>

<p>The middle light flashing is usually a god indication that your system is over heating due to poor ventilation, weather it be stuffed away in a closed, cramped space, or just dusty and clogged up on the inside.</p>
<p>Here is a page with some troubleshooting steps to possibly fix your issue:<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/power-button-blinks-red" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../power-button-blinks-red</a></p>
<p>Last resort if none of the troubleshooting works is that your console needs to be repaired, or replaced.</p>

<p>If it's a slim make sure before you turn it on that all cables and HDD/THUMB STICKS(if they contain profile) ARE FULLY PLUGGED IN.</p>
<p>For a system that according to release statement from XBOX the NEW SLIM MODELS will NEVER RING LIGHT. LIERS! it does; for a system you claimed that red lights were not even installed on this system.</p>
<p>FYI when I got this my 320 HDD switched to "UNFORMATTED" LOST ALL DATA and had to re-format took 3-4 days to get system to do it( was not the system as I put my old 250 HDD in and it worked fine)XBL needs to check on this issue as the day it happened everyone
 was having connection issues(when my drive quit out) I see a PS4 in my furture as XBL forgot how to help people but are more then willing to take the cash &amp; give no usefull help.

<p>G'day all! Let's try a power cycle on your consoles if you haven't already. Hold the power button for 5-10 seconds and allow it to completely shut down. Wait a full 30 seconds, then restart the console and launch the game. Let us know if that helps. If it
 doesn't, please provide some more details as to what's happening. Does it lock up completely, boot you do the home screen, etc? Does it happen at random, or consistently in the same place?

<h3> angiek  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Save IM As...&#34; function in Skype for Business</h2>
                    
<p>We use it extensively internally and with our customers. After a large meeting, briefing, presentation, there's always a bunch of messages in the IM window that we want to keep for records, follow-up, review things we missed, etc... Presenters also want
 to see what conversations took place via IM while they were busy presenting. This worked great in Lync.</p>
<p>We recently upgraded to this new Skype replacement. We can find this functionality anymore and googling yielded nothing. How is this done in SFB?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Yes, the new interface seems to lack the menu option, but you should still be able to press the F12 key to save it. With a remark though. If the "Save IM conversation in my email" option is disabled (which can be done either client- or server-side), you
 will not be able to use the Save as IM option (or press F12) to save the conversation.</p>

<h2>            Unwanted and automatic downloads to my computer</h2>
                    <div>I monitor automatic downloads to my computer since I have a limited GB allotment.&nbsp; Through the use of TCPview.exe downloaded from technet, I noticed two entities have been downloading very large files (greater than 500MB) to my computer.&nbsp; They are 'ptr.us.xo.net'
 and 'amaitechnologies.com'.&nbsp; I cannot figure out how much they intend to download.&nbsp; Who are these companies and how can I stop them from downloading?&nbsp; I have been able, I thought, to change the settings on every program on my computer to prevent it from automatic
 'updates' except for one.&nbsp; That program will be removed from my computer once it has completed its limited&nbsp;usefulness.&nbsp; What I want to do is to be able to identify the company doing the downloading and if it is legit, then I will take my laptop to the local
 libray and download the large files there.&nbsp; Afterward I will bring the laptop home and transfer the large update file to the desktop.&nbsp; This saves my limited download GB allotment.&nbsp; I, frequently use this method of updating my computer in the small community
 without high speed internet connection except at the library.&nbsp; Thanks for any and all information you can provide.&nbsp; regards, milt</div>

</p><p>Unlike WIN 7 where i simply go into hidden icons, internet access, right click the router Im connected to, go to properties, tick the '<strong>see password</strong>' check box...and hey presto I can see my password!......but that pathway isn't in WIN 10....I
 had to get on another device with WIN 7 to see my password</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do you find and see your router password in WIN 10</p>
<p>

            <p>To find the wireless password of the network you are currently connected to in Windows 10, I'd use one of the following methods.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Method 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections -&gt; Change Adapter Settings -&gt; double click your Wireless adapter
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should then see the 'Wireless Properties' button to the right of 'Details...' button. Click Wireless Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are already connected to the target wireless network, you should see the SSID page now. Click the tab at the top call 'Security'. This is where you find your password info like in Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tick 'Show&nbsp;Characters' in order to see the password used for current wireless connection.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Method 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Wireless icon in bottom right of screen. This will show you available wireless connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom you should see 'Network Settings'. Under that you'll see the actual wireless network you are connected to. R-Click on the wireless network here and you will see a 'Go to settings' button pop-up. Click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the way over on Network and Internet settings panel you should find a scroll down bar. (often hidden till you roll over it.) Scroll down to the bottom past all the available wireless networks</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom you will find 'Change Adaptor Options'. Click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click your Wireless adapter -&gt; Wireless Properties -&gt; Security tab -&gt; tick 'Show Characters'</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There are merits to both methods. One is more like traditional XP/Win7, but takes a click or two more than method 2 unless you have short cuts set up. Method 2 is easier for tablets, which seems to be the direction personal computers are going. I like to
 know both ways so it's easier going from one to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Star Wars&#58; KOTOR &#40;on demand Xbox classic game&#41; won&#39;t download to my 360...</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic off the Xbox Live Marketplace (it appeared on the marketplace around the time it became backwards compatible on&nbsp;Xbox One, sometime in the last week or so). No matter what I do the game won't download.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p>



<p>I've tried resetting the system cache, resetting router, power cycling the console, resetting my internet settings on the console...nothing works. I've tried countless times to get this to download to no avail. If I&nbsp;leave the tab open and wait for it to download, it reaches 100%. From there I select "Play Now" and it goes to a black screen, then to the Dashboard. I look for it in My Games and it isn't there. Then I check the HDD&nbsp;storage&nbsp;and there's a corrupted file the same size as the game I'm trying to download, so I delete that and try again (I delete the corrupted file every time).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I had a chat with Xbox&nbsp;Support and the person came to the conclusion that this is a problem with my internet. That simply isn't the case. I have downloaded TONS&nbsp;of stuff, lots of Arcade titles and On Demand games, as well as many of the GwG titles. I've never had a problem downloading online content, so I have no reason to believe that suddenly my internet can't handle a 4 GB download.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>And I know it isn't my hard drive. I bought the console new. I'm using the E&nbsp;model Xbox 360 which came with a 500 GB hard drive right out of the box. I have original xbox discs that work in my console just fine (played them recently, too!).</p><p><br /></p>



<p>So, before I&nbsp;request a refund for this game, are&nbsp;there any other things I could try to get it working? I've literally tried everything I could think of.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Re-Identifying Network Issue</h2>
                    I have a Desktop with Windows 10 but I don't have a wifi card in it. But, I am using an extender to connect my pc to the wifi. But for some reason it started to say identifying network, then it connects. I can use it for a minute then I cant use the internet
 and I go to see the network stats and it says Identifying Network. It repeats this ALOT. The extender I am using is a TP-Link TL-WA850RE. I should note that I have tested my laptop with the Ethernet and It worked perfectly fine. No issue at all. Please Help.

    <title>So I purchased Fable III &#40;2015&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andantejones-pike  say:</h3>
<h2>            So I purchased Fable III &#40;2015&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I hope everyone who plans on buying this game and all future versions of this game will read this before going through with it.</p>
<p>In late&nbsp;mid-November of 2015 I purchased a PC DVD version of Fable 3 from GameStop's online store. I was excited&nbsp;about the idea of playing one of the sequels to a game I had genuinely enjoyed when I was younger, and I couldn't argue with the price.</p>
<p>When the game arrived I was thrilled and installed it immediately without doing any research on the game or its online gameplay feature, completely ignoring the announcement of "Games for Windows LIVE" on the front of the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon installation I launched the game and was greeted with a Fable 3 launch screen and the option to launch the game, and when I clicked on the option to launch the game I was greeted with an additional screen informing me that I would have to sign in to
 "Microsoft Games for Windows LIVE".</p>
<p>Simple enough, right? I clicked continue and after a brief processing screen I was informed that I could not connect to "Games for Windows LIVE", and that I should check my internet connection. After Several attempts I did a brief search on the internet
 and found that "Microsoft Games for Windows LIVE" was no longer a service being provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little confused but undeterred, I scoured the internet for patches and updates, reading up on other people's encounters with this issue, and after trying just about every trick in the digital book, I called Microsoft. My first call with them was brief
 and very discouraging as the man I spoke with claimed "Microsoft is not responsible for products developed by Lionhead Studios."</p>
<p>I hung up with them and spent a few days forgetting about the game. Today (11/22/2015) I called Microsoft again, and after roughly&nbsp;a half an hour of&nbsp;being passed around to just over a half a dozen different representatives, I am on hold with the promise
 that Microsoft can help me with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 3:01pm (10 minutes after I was put on hold), I was connected to a brand new representative who proceeded to feed me the bit about contacting Lionhead Studio before putting me on hold again.</p>
<p>At 3:07pm I was asked for my phone number for the ninth time and almost immediately put on hold.</p>
<p>A few moments later I was transferred to a person I could not understand at all, but I explained my problem... and was put on hold to wait for the next person whom I also could not understand.</p>
<p>At 3:27pm I hung up after giving the final representative my email and asking that they contact me via internet communication. Five of those minutes were spent attempting to ensure that they had gotten my email correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than waiting for them to contact me I tried calling a different&nbsp;number. I told the representative (Robin, the first name I've understood so far, lol) what the issues was and was put on hold. When Robin picked up again, he wanted to transfer me again,
 so I just asked about their online support. </p>
<p>At 4:09pm I contacted Microsoft's online support and spoke with Adrian Maria T, who informed me he was not an expert on my particular issue, and redirected me to a list of specialists. I selected one of the techs and waited to be connected with them via
 online chat.</p>
<p>At 6:50pm I gave up on my wait, thus concluding my tale of what happens when you purchase a game with Microsoft online authentication encoded into the launch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and Lionhead Studios could have just as easily required online authentication once you attempted to use the game for online gaming, but instead they chose to restrict the usage of this game solely to people who purchased it within a strict deadline.
 They did not pull the unusable copies from the shelves&nbsp;or recall what they knew for a whole 365+ days&nbsp;to be&nbsp;an unplayable game.</p>
<p>There are no remnants of Microsoft's Games for Windows LIVE, and somehow nobody at Microsoft was tasked with producing an update or patch intended&nbsp;to fix the requirement of online authentication for a single player game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shocked as I was to admit it, Microsoft is assuming zero accountability for Fable 3, and will most likely rerelease the game at full price within five years time.</p>
<p>The lesson here? It's hard to say. I don't want to badmouth Microsoft but they've really let me and numerous other people down. This game is still available at Amazon and other web stores for relatively cheap, but no price is low enough for a game that is
 about as good as a coaster for your table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is easily the WORST example of Microsoft's otherwise excellent customer service concerning outdated products. You have a better chance of successfully installing and using Windows 3.5 than you do a copy of Fable 3 purchased in or&nbsp;after 2015.</p>

    <title>Product Key Deactivation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crispyt7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product Key Deactivation</h2>
                    <p>A while ago, a friend of mine lent me their copy of Fable 3. I managed to install it and use
<strong>their own</strong> product for my account. I have now recently&nbsp;bought my own copy of the game and created a new account as we wish to play it together but they cannot connect online because of the separate account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have a solution to deactivating the product key of a game on a Windows Live account? I know Fable 3 is an old game but it would be great if somebody could help me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            Hello PAULINEHEWINS,
<br />
<br />This might happened after any Windows update, like u did.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to try this:
<br />
<br />Open device manager, go to bluetooth option.
<br />If u cant find it go to Network Adapters: if u cant see anything that has to do with buletooth then go to: Universal Serial Bus Controllers and at least one of the insnt working.
<br />    So what you have to do is:
<br /> 1. Open Device Manager
<br /> 2. Scroll down to find Universal Serial Bus Controllers and expand it
<br /> 3. If you use a mouse with a USB adapter, you need to figure out which controller uses it
<br /> 4. Looking at the Universal Serial Bus Controllers, unplug your mouse.
<br /> 5. One of the images should go gray. This is the controller for your mouse. 
<br /> 6. Plug the mouse in and you should see it become black again. If not, then you were looking at the wrong one. Try again. 
<br /> 7. Check which controller this is
<br /> 8. Unistall every device but the mouse. 
<br /> 9. Uninstall the controller for your mouse. 
<br /> 10. And finally turn it off and back on ( do not jus restart)
<br />
<br />Hope this coul helps you       
        </p>

            Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings  go to Update &amp; Security and after  go to Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Update the  Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model. Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - System Icon Tray and Search Box Disappear from Task Bar &#40;and fix&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had this annoying little problem a few times recently so presumably introduced by a Windows update recently..... It is very annoying and I could not find the answer anyway on the web and subbled across ths answer yesterday having tried tried pretty much
 everyingthing else to try and fix it (e.g regedit, scf /scannow and a host of other things).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the search bar to open programs like excel quickly so the missing search bar was a total pain in the **** and wasting loads of my time. Snagit and other System Tray links being missing also made my life harder (wasted time opening them the long way
 around).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the systems icon tray (volume control, power , wifi or network icon etc etc has disappeared just to the left of the clock on the right of the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the search box on the left of the task bar has also disappeared here is the fix that worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP4 is connected to a SP4 Docking Station. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Simply detach the power supply wait a few seconds then reattach the power supply and the taks bar refreshes with the missing system icon tray and search box.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me around 4 to 5 hours yesterday to find this solution by trial and error. It is not a permanent fix as you need to do it each time when you boot up and the icons and search box are missing ut at least the fix is easy and quick each time.</p>
<br />
<p>It might just be a docking station bug that has recently been introduced by a Windows Update is my guess (thanks Microsoft for the wasted half day of my life working out a solution to this very annoying and time wasting little bug!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps other people save hours of the life wasted trying to fix this annoying recent bug in Windows and the SP4 particularly is my guess.</p>

    <title>Audio hiearchy between applications within Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marine dawg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio hiearchy between applications within Windows 10</h2>
                    When using an audio source, if another audio source is started it is silenced and plays no audio.&nbsp; For instance when listening to music via Groove, Pandora, Spotify et cetera and the launching Edge (any browser for that matter) and any page that generates
 audio it does not play said audio.&nbsp; You can go back to the audio program hit pause the resume and now both audio sources can be heard.&nbsp; From herein the audio from the browser (or any assumed second audio source) will only play under two conditions.&nbsp; Either
 you music app must be playing music or the page gets reloaded/relaunched to be gain "audio dominance."&nbsp; This did not exist in Windows 7, I don't know what is causing this dilemma.&nbsp; I am using a Surface Book 2.

            I will try those methods.&nbsp; As far as the situation, it is duplicated 100% of the time regardless of the audio source.&nbsp; Source 1 will be dominat over source 2 regardless of the program or file type.<br />

 by doing a search for drivers from within "Properties" for the printer (there were 4 or 5 listed) and the third one installed for me and I haven't looked back.&nbsp; I have no idea why this happened for what it got fixed, just happy it works.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately there are not guarantees that any printer, etc that we have installed on a previous version of Windows will work with the current one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like HP does not want to provide support or drivers for it anymore.&nbsp; So you either have to use another version of Windows the does have drivers for it.&nbsp; Or get a newer printer.</p>

 the "tree"&nbsp;Under&nbsp;&nbsp;printers, remove any "unknown devices" Worked for me bonne chance</p>

            <p>That didn't work for me. I've even removed the printer, and allowed Windows 10 to "discover" it and install it. The printer works, the update doesn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Null Print - HP ENVY 5640 series - Error 0x800f020b</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that I am working with a laptop and this printer is used in one location via the local wifi and selected as default. I have another printer installed for use at another location. That one is networked via cat5 through a different router. I
 don't think those facts are germane, but I put them out there anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remove the update fail notice from the notification area only to have it return every day.</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Keyboard and Mouse Works, Stops Working, then Works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josh_365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Keyboard and Mouse Works, Stops Working, then Works Again</h2>
                    <p>When the computer turns on (from restarting/shutting down/sleep) or when the screen is detached and reattached, the built-in trackpad and keyboard are both able to work for 15-30 seconds. After that, both stop working and only the touchscreen is able to
 work. The keyboard's&nbsp;backlight,&nbsp;Fn, and detach button still work during this period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;maybe another 30-40 seconds, there is a notification at the bottom right screen with a yellow triangle and an exclamation point that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB device not recognized</p>
<p>The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs even though I have not attached any other USB devices and I believe that the computer doesn't recognize the built-in keyboard and trackpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only after this notification appears, the keyboard and trackpad are both able to perform well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also a brand new Surface Book 2 and while I was setting it up, I could not move the mouse or type on the keyboard and rather used the Cortana Assistant to complete the first boot and edit&nbsp;the preferred settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to fix this? Thank you.</p>
                </div>

    <title>Language Inconsistencies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baldguy_369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language Inconsistencies</h2>
                    <p>I have odd inconsistencies in language across different 'parts' of Windows 10. My language and region settings are set to Canadian English, but certain Windows 10 apps like Calendar, Photos, Calculator, etc. are all using Hebrew. Their icons use Hebrew,
 all of the menus are in Hebrew, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This causes me 2 problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I don't speak enough Hebrew to use these apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, it seems that Cortana also wants to use Hebrew, and so insists that it is unable to function because of my language settings (even though my language and region settings are Canadian English, which has just been added for Cortana).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find where to adjust the language for these apps. The problem started when I tried to download a Hebrew language extension for Office to use spell check features.</p>

            <p>Just got my shiny new Ultrabook - and was very disappointed by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The opening screen (the screen after power-on and before logon) shows the date in Norwegian. The request by the manufacturer of the computer to register is also in Norwegian. And the worst thing is that my scanner software installs in Norwegian too (this
 software worked satisfactory on my old XP laptops for years).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some fantasy, combining my knowledge of English, Dutch and German I can guess roughly what is said - but obviously that is not good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the system there are lots of places to specify languages but nowhere I saw "Norwegian", neither did I specify Norwegian when I started my pristine laptop the day before yersterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional observation I just made: <em>sometimes</em> the correct language is displayed on the initial screen. But then it reverts to Norwegian again. No, I have to changed anything meanwhile.</p>
<p>

            <p>As with sanitysucks and FritsJansenZ, the language inconsistencies on Windows 10 persist for me. Cortana now works - I had mistakenly associated Cortana's problem with the language inconsistency. The language inconsistency is more troubling. Calendar, Email,
 Store, Pictures, Skype, and other Windows-affiliated apps are all entirely and stubbornly in Hebrew, despite the fact that I've set English to be the default and display language everywhere I can. (I assume that those are the names of the apps in English.
 There are other apps whose names and functions I can't guess - some app with a lightbulb as its icon, and another one that seems to pair the computer with a smartphone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, tell us, where have you hidden the language settings for these applications? Why don't they respond to the normal language controls?</p>

            To clarify: This problem affects roughly 21 Windows-affiliated apps, and I have the same problem on all 3 of my Windows 10 devices (a laptop, a desktop, and a tablet).

            Thanks for sharing that. All of my language and region settings (including the settings under the Administrative tab mentioned above) are Canadian English. All of the Windows apps continue to display and run in Hebrew. Thanks for trying to help.

    <title>Password Problem with windows 10 &#38; my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password Problem with windows 10 &#38; my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft community,</p>
<p>hoping someone can help. I dutifully changed my password for my microsoft email account which worked but when I want to log onto my laptop now &nbsp;I have to use the old &nbsp;password &nbsp;to login then the new password to access my email. &nbsp;Previously whenever I changed
 password I only had to use one password to access everything once I logged onto the laptop. &nbsp;The situation is aggravating but not a matter of dire urgency. &nbsp;I have a prepaid internet drive because where I live does not have access to the Internet so I'm careful
 about how much time I spend on the Internet. My laptop (a good brand) is approx 3 years old but in good working order. &nbsp;For heavy duty Internet usage I access the computers at my local library.</p>
<p>Also I have downloaded windows 10 prior to the password change no problems</p>
<p>Looking forward to your thoughts</p>
<p>KayeW</p>
<p>

<p>Bom, entramos naquele velho dilema, "e se", por si só a fonte já serve como proteção do aparelho, haja vista que poderia ser "descartado" o uso de aparelhos auxiliares para está função.</p>
<p>É aconselhável que utilizem sim um segundo aparelho de proteção, prevenindo assim um possível dano à fonte do aparelho, que não deve ser muito barata... Como já é de conhecimento de todos esses aparelhos em sua grande maioria possuem fusíveis que são facilmente
 trocados em casos de queima, isso sem contar no preço... É aconselhado que se utilize um no-break justamente pra se evitar desligamentos repentinos, podendo danificar alguma instalação ou romper algum arquivo dentre outros, &nbsp;caso não seja viável financeiramente
 eu mesmo utilizo um filtro de linha com protetor de ruídos, que serve pra evitar a queima por raios ou descargas elevadas próximas a minha região.</p>
<p>OBS: Compre aparelhos decentes, aparelhos de má qualidade podem interferir na quantidade de energia que está indo para a fonte/console e gerar ainda mais prejuízos futuros. Vale salientar que o desligamento abrupto do sistema dificilmente danificará o aparelho,

<p>Michael, a MICROSOFT recomenda, eles criaram tudo, fizeram arquitetura e projetaram, colocaram todas as peças, eles entendem bem mais que a gente ;) não é por que achamos que é melhor uma coisa, que irá ser melhor, eles fizeram a fonte como um estabilizador,
 como falaram, então é melhor seguirmos o conselho de quem criou e sabe como funciona de verdade o aparelho.</p>
<p>"é aconselhavel" por quem? pelos técnicos que criaram a fonte? acho que não... heheh
</p>
<p>mas tudo bem, cada um com sua opinião ;D Abraço!</p>

<p>Entre filtro de linha e estabilizador, opto pelo filtro de linha.</p>
<p>O esquema de ligação que utilizo é o seguinte:</p>
<p>TV e aparelho via satélite, DVD, ligados em um filtro, onde, neste mesmo filtro está ligado outro filtro, exclusivo para ligar o Xbox 360 e Xbox One.</p>
<p>Tempos atrás havia muita queda de energia em minha cidade, sempre utilizei este método com os filtros e nunca tive problema nestes aparelhos, lembrando que já queimou um roteador em uma destas quedas de energia que não usava este tipo de proteção, que agora
 já conta com o mesmo sistema.</p>
<p>Se é correto, não sei, mas está funcionando!</p>

<p>Na verdade não, não é aconselhável usar uma estabilizador pra um X360 ou XOne, pois ele já tem uma fonte interna, se por acaso houver uma queda de energia e a volta dela vir acima do esperado a fonte e o estabilizador pode vir a entrar em colisão e acabar
 queimando o aparelho. </p>

<p>Com certeza não, use um estabilizador ou no-break que é muito mais seguro, agora se não tem jeito mesmo liga na tomada mas nao é recomendado.</p>
