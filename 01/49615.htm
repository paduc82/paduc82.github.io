    <title>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION on ESPN website - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtman44  say:</h3>
<h2>            DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION on ESPN website</h2>
                    <p>This started happening in the last several days but only when ESPN.com is open. BSOD with www.windows.stopcode and the&nbsp;DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION followed by several minutes while it sends the "error info" and then reboots. Sometimes it happens when opening
 the page on Google Chrome (if the page is slow to load) and sometimes it will run for 30 minutes before it happens. I tried loading the page on Edge and it happened almost instantly. But has ONLY happened on ESPN. Could it be because ESPN is still an http
 and not https? Could ESPN be causing it by making the page load slow because I use an Ad blocker? Any recent changes to Windows 10 that would cause this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has happened over a dozen times in the last week and has me frustrated enough to use other sports sites for scores etc but sometimes they are the only game in town to watch a college BB game.</p>

            Hi there JTman! Thanks to a fellow Microsoft Community VIP ZigZag, I have a few possible solutions for your issue.
<br />
<br />"1-Memtest.
<br />*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. (CAUTION, EXTERNAL SITE)  <a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org</a> 
<br />*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.
<br />*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.
<br />*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.
<br />
<br />Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.
<br />If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.
<br />
<br />2-Driver verifier
<br />Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.
<br />
<br />*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.
<br />*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.
<br />*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.
<br />*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).
<br />
<br />Here is the procedure:
<br />- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter
<br />- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"
<br />- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"
<br />- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"
<br />- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"
<br />*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"
<br />- Select "Finish" on the next page.
<br />*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.
<br />*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.
<br />*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.
<br />*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.

            Hi JTman44,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>I have the same issue with ESPN on two different laptops. Started on the 18th of January. I have updated drivers, performed check disk, read Microsoft's useless suggestions for a remedy. All to no avail. All other websites function properly. I would be interested
 in any ideas as to the solution.</p>

<p>I finally got my Minidump (.dmp) files open and the two I still have both show the same problem: Symbols could not be loaded for<strong> IDSvia64.sys</strong> which is a<strong> Norton</strong> file. Couldn't find anything recent on their forums so will
 have to post there and see what they say. Still strange that it ONLY happens on ESPN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some old posts showed people uninstalling Norton and reinstalling but no explanations as to why and it did not always solve the problem.</p>

    <title>Black screen after logon on lenovo T520 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bazagee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after logon on lenovo T520 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I faced this issue on a Lenovo X201T upgade but that was fixed by forcing presentation screens. Not so on the T520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a fresh Windows 7 Pro with all updates and Lenovo drivers. After I had it configured as I needed I spun the upgrade ISO disk to install 10 (RTM). This is laptop is not connected to a domain and has no password entered into the user account as
 yet.</p>
<p>At boot it logs on and I see the desktop of about 8 to 10 seconds then goes to black screen with workable mouse cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can bring up Task Manager with Ctl-Alt-Delete. I can boot to Safe Mode but the same process happens (blank screen after logon).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing Nvidia drivers from Device Manager (after launching it via Task Manager).</p>
<p>Tried running Explorer.exe via Task Manager. Disabled any video drivers in Startup tab of Task Manager.</p>
<p>Tried windows key + P and selecting the last option (3 down arrow clicks followed by enter.
</p>
<p>Tried connecting external VGA monitor (I see the same as the laptop black screen if external monitor is enabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run out of ideas on this one....&nbsp; anyone? </p>
<p>TIA</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. This seems to be a profile based issue...&nbsp; I can switch user or log out and get the&nbsp;'before' picture&nbsp;(hole in the rock) and the logon&nbsp;screen to display. As soon as I press enter to logon (remember there is no password yet) the&nbsp;would-be desktop&nbsp;goes black.
 I can see any error message or informational message boxes/windows that I may be able to button-mash - just nothing connected with the users desktop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try to create another profile (if I can get to that screen and see it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: after launching control.exe from task manager &gt; User accounts &gt; Manage&nbsp; another account &gt; Add a new&nbsp;user - I get an explorer.exe error message window "Class not registered" error. The account I am logon on with has Administrator privileges. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2:&nbsp; I was able to add another user account via cmd.exe net user command (did not make this user an administrator account). At logon I got a desktop until the profile must have sniffed out the Intel HD Graphics 3000 and Nvidia NVS 4200M adapters which
 in turn loaded the Nvidia 10.18.13.5382 drivers 8/7/2015 with the Digital Signer MS Hardware Compatibility Publisher.
</p>
<p>Looking at the events log of these two devices I see EventID 441 errors on the day of upgrade giving Device PCI\Ven_#### could not be migrated.
</p>
<p>Next step look for windows 10 drivers for this card and try to install.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">winver</span>
</em>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What is the edition of Windows operating system installed when you bought this computer?</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer before you experienced this issue?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>Did you receive any error messages when doing system restore?</span></li><li><span>Where do you backup your files?</span></li></ul>

<p>I'd like to second&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/66deb41c-9a55-4a44-adcf-88936366465f">Joann Eva's&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>response and ask another question: "Have you recently installed and used a Third Party Registry Cleaner and Antivirus Program such as CCleaner or one of its many competitors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because that would explain a whole lot. Those "Cleaners" are hazardous to your computer's health. The problem is that you can often use them quite a few times and find that your computer speeds up rather nicely. Then, one day, important drivers
 and other things inexplicably go missing (usually you discover this on a restart) and you're in the soup. I still wake up screaming from memories of my early experiences with System Mechanic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let us clarify: Is it a System RESTORE or a System RESET you cannot get to work?</p>
<p>System Restore is when you go back to an earlier (saved backup) version of your system from before problems began showing up. With those backups having been lost (or deleted) naturally System Restore is not going to work. There is nothing for it
 to go back TO.</p>
<p>If you recently installed the CREATORS UPDATE you could ROLL BACK your computer to your previous version of Windows 10 (if it was less than 10 days ago) with the aid of your windows,old file.</p>
<p>See this link for helpful instructions on dealing with that:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, a System Reset is best accomplished from this Menu on your Hard Drive:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3fe8a0b-7655-4761-8c02-8d2fab2fd2fc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3fe8a0b-7655-4761-8c02-8d2fab2fd2fc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If you cannot get that Menu to open normally you will need to type msconfig in your Cortana Search Window...select the first item that comes up on the menu:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71cc6e45-394c-479c-80fc-57b63c429bbc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71cc6e45-394c-479c-80fc-57b63c429bbc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And restart your computer in Safe Mode aka "Diagnostic Startup" THEN run Restore/Recovery from there.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade starts spontaneously under Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saktinathmukherjee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade starts spontaneously under Windows Update</h2>
                    I have Windows 8.1 running in my laptop. I have consciously uninstalled KB 3035583 (Get Windows 10). Under Control Panel-&gt; Windows Update, I have changed settings to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download &amp; install them". I have hidden
 "Windows 10 upgrade", but still whenever I try to Install other upgrade like "Definition update for Windows Defender" ,"Malicious Software detector", etc. "Windows 10 Upgrade" starts automatically. &nbsp;<strong>This eats up my metered Internet Data usage&nbsp;&amp; Windows
 10 upgrade failed to Install at 24% always with "Something Happened". </strong>The setuperr.log is blank.&nbsp;This is vexing &amp; I had to disable "Windows Update" totally.Is there any way out?

            <strong>There is no solution provided for "Something Happened" in the link provided, which was last updated by the author Andre Da Costa on 6th August,2015.
</strong><strong>Also you have not mentioned any solution to stop spontaneous downloading of "Windows 10 Upgrade" inspite of the checks provided in the Settings.</strong> Today also when I tried to "Install" Virus Updates for "Windows Defender" &amp; "Malicious
 Software" the screen immediately changed to "Downloading Windows 10 Upgrade -Getting Set Up files". I had to stop "Installation" &amp; Disable "Windows Update" at "Services". Microsoft Support Engineers should be more knowledgeable to solve problems rather than
 referring to links, which don't have any relevance..

            This upgrading to Windows 10 wrecked my laptop. Though it is able to perform the basic tasks, some important files are missing : I am unable to "Recover" from Control Panel -&gt;Recovery. I'll suggest you may try downloading the ISO file in a DVD &amp; Create
 a USB Installation Stick using Rufus. You have to Use MediaCreationTool.exe(version 16423 or later) &amp; also ensure you download the compatible version suitable for your "Language", Region","Locale", etc (the default is en-us). The Procedure is detailed in the
 Wiki Article, "How to Download official Windows 10 ISO files". Best of luck.

            <p>Greg, thanks for your questions. &nbsp;I started the install from the Get Windows 10 icon in the System Tray. &nbsp;For the last 18 hours, it's been stuck on Upgrading Windows - 76% and showing that it is configuring settings at only 6%. &nbsp;It looks like the system
 is completely frozen. &nbsp;My inclination is to turn off the laptop and see what happens. &nbsp;I did download the Windows 10 media creation tool to my USB Flashdrive and downloaded the Windows 10 Upgrade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Vince - </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and press the power button until it shuts down.&nbsp; When you start it back up hopefully it will roll back or offer a Boot Menu item to Roll back.&nbsp; If not you may need to reimage or reinstall the qualifying WIndows 7/8.1 but this may also be the best
 path anyway to overcome whatever is interfering with Upgrade.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it rolls back you can try right clicking on Task Bar to open Task Manager, uncheck everything on Startup tab and reboot.&nbsp; Then uninstall any AV besides Defender so it doesn't interfere with upgrade or built-in Defender which is adequate.&nbsp; Then open the
 installation media within Windows, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.</p>

I meen i would be happy purchasing content if i enjoy the game but forcing me to purchase content before playing a free to play game will not happen. I am pretty sure MS are opening them self's to law suit's.</p>

            Hello, I have started a new discussion at the forum informing that War Thunder's free to play version is going to be released on the Xbox One. I was looking at past War Thunder posts about the free to play version and wanted to let as many people who are
 interested in War Thunder to know. If Microsoft Agent Moderator 'XBF Lesile D' is viewing this, I could not find a way to message you after your comments and just wanted to let you know, and thank you for the links that you provided.

<h2>            Skype for Business Gibraltar</h2>
                    <p>We have a small office in Gibraltar and would like to implement **** for external telephony but the Microsoft PSTN calling plan is not available there and due to the size of the office, we do not want any on-premises **** servers as local support is minimal.
 The Tel nos also need to be local numbers. Due to a lack of both options, are there any other options available to implement **** as we're migrating to **** across other international sites within the organisation? The other sites are larger and are in UK,&nbsp;USA
 &nbsp;and Canada where Micrsofot PSTN calling plans are available or we have the option of installing on-premises **** servers on SIP trunks.</p>

Since Skype for Business PSTN calling is not available in Gibraltar, you may need to deploy on-premises Skype for Business server. Here are two articles for your reference.

It is still not feasible to purchase PSTN calling in Gibraltar. You can refer to the article below for more details and know the new updates of PSNT calling.<br />

            <p>The Playstore is only available on Google Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to the Windows Store, try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Check Windows Update for the latest updates first.</p>
<p>- </p>
<p>Press Windows key + Q</p>
<p>Type: <strong>troubleshooting</strong></p>

</span></span></span><span>
<p>I would suggest you to rename the software distribution folder by following the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Type cmd in the search bar.</p>
<p>2. Right click and select "run as administrator"</p>
<p>3. Copy the following command and press enter after each line:<br />
<strong><em><br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
cd %systemroot%<br />
ren SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
</em></strong>4. Restart the computer and try to download the apps.</p>

            I just fixed this problem. I have a Lenovo Thinkpad and my log on reverted back to Windows Classic with the slower sign in and I was unable to switch back unless I uninstalled atginahook.dll, a program that is made by AuthenTec, Inc. It is part of the
 security system in my Lenovo, specifically fingerprint security. After trial and error I got a message from AuthenTec that suggested I might have True Suite biometric programs in my computer and to uninstall it. In the program list I found Lenovo Fingerprint
 Security and uninstalled it. Problem solved. I don't know what set this thing off, but it was annoying. Hope this helps.

                    Previously on my laptop, I was always able to set up a mobile hotspot. However after the recent update, the hotspot refuses to turn on and even crashes&nbsp; my computer. Upon checking cmd, my Network share adapter is now off when before the update it was on.
 what should I do?

            Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options

<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.

    <title>How do I stop Windows automatically changing resolution when a new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikephillips_798  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows automatically changing resolution when a new display is detected&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When windows detects a new display device connected, it automatically changes to what it considers the best resolution, typically 1920 x 1080. This occurs in both Windows 7 and XP, and with different graphics vendor's chips (e.g. nVidia, ATI, Intel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our software has to run at specific resolutions, so we need some way of turning off this anti-social behaviour! I have tried experimenting with registry keys, but the settings get over-written.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that we also have to use specific drivers to work with legacy hardware, so updating to the latest drivers definitely won't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A related problem which occurs on Windows 7 / ATI systems - after initially setting up with a VGA monitor only, if I then plug in an HDMI display and attempt to set Clone mode (aka Duplicate these displays), the resolution also gets forced to 1920 x 1080,
 and I then have to reset the resolution manually. Is there a way to stop the resolution changing when changing the multiple monitor settings? I think this also happens if I try to change the orientation to portrait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance will be greatly appreciated, not just by me, but by others who appear to have raised the same problem, but without a satisfactory answer.</p>

            <p>Hi Karthik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, even if it was not the answer I was hoping for. It is unfortunate that the designers chose to implement an automatic "feature" without providing a method to disable it when required, as it really is very annoying, especially for unattended
 operation.</p>

    <title>FUBAR after update to Windows 10 Pro version 1709 OS Build 16299.98 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avip toyou  say:</h3>
<h2>            FUBAR after update to Windows 10 Pro version 1709 OS Build 16299.98</h2>
                    <p>I allowed an update over-night on Friday, 3 days ago.&nbsp; New version is Windows 10 Pro, version 1709, OS Build 16299.98.&nbsp; Not sure old version, but it would be whatever was the official prior build since I do not normally delay new updates very long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have the following symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>User folder changed to XXX.YYY where XXX = computer name and YYY = user name.&nbsp; This caused all system folders to reset.&nbsp; The old system folders are in the old user folder which was simply YYY.&nbsp; Yes I know how to access Properties --&gt; Move.&nbsp; But should I
 have to do that?<br />
</li><li>Some non-Microsoft apps are gone &amp; had to be reinstalled.<br />
<br />
</li><li>A whole bunch of bloat-ware was installed like Candy Crush &amp; etc.<br />
</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Font size</span>&nbsp;used for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
icons</span> etc. are <strong>tiny</strong>.&nbsp; Attempting to use Display Settings &gt; Font Size changing from 100% to 125% affects ONLY TEXT within a window and NOTHING ELSE.&nbsp; The desktop icon font size and the font size used in Menus etc. is unchanged.<br />
<br />
</li><li>TaskBar completely reset.&nbsp; Trying to PIN *anything* to it, it deletes any any prior pinned items and pins the one new item.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Log off, restart, power off -- none of these help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by a Microsoft techie in a prior question &amp; answer, that there are unfortunate side effects of an upgrade.&nbsp; Did Microsoft intent to BREAK a bunch of stuff and FUBAR my system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, it seems like the upgrade has some major errors.&nbsp; What do I do now?&nbsp; Roll back version?&nbsp; Reinstall latest version (not sure how to do that)?&nbsp; Full PC reset -- and then I have to reinstall a LOT</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to check if you're still experiencing the stated symptoms after performing the update? If yes, can you perform a clean boot and check if you encounter the same symptoms while in the clean boot environment. To do this, follow the steps provided

<p>well honestly speaking basically you're **** now !!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I personally tested all the windows 10 buildz since it was released<br />
and honestly the 1709 build is the worst one<br />
from my personal experience it just become extremely painfully obvious that&nbsp;<br />
the ms windows 10 team have no **** clue to how fix the existing problems of windows 10<br />
so they decide to ignore those problems and add more problems among the new features that nobody really care about<br />
my best advice to you is just re-install windows 7 or windows 8.1 or Linux if you like it<br />
and forget that windows 10 even exist </p>
<p>because microsoft with the current delusional attitude about windows 10<br />
they're going end up just like they did with windows 10 mobile phone<br />
and when that happen you don't want to be even near to windows 10<br />
now you just wait and watch that happen...!!! </p>

<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 upgrade is demanding an additional 8G storage which I cannot do, therefore the upgrade will not download. I cannot make the download directly to the SD card.</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading to a newer version of Windows 10 basically needs at least 20GB of storage for the download to pursue. If you are having a hard time upgrading because of not enough space issue, we suggest deleting some files and apps that are not needed. Or, you
 can transfer them to another external hard drive to free up space for the upgrade. You can refer to this article for tips on how to

<p>Hi, thanks for the answer, however...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop - ASUS E200H - only has 32G of storage. I deleted/uninstalled absolutely everything possible but it still isn't enough.
</p>
<p>If the update needs 20G then I cannot physically clear that space as the current Windows/system files only leaves 12G<br />
</p>
<p>I have an additional 32G on an external SD card but the update will only download to the local storage, where I cannot create 20G free space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop tells me that it cannot install important security updates until I upgrade but how can I upgrade my laptop ?</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If you have deleted and uninstalled unnecessary apps to free up space and the system is still asking for another 8GB storage, you have the option to use another external hard drive for the update to continue. You can refer to these

<p>Hello Anne,</p>
<p>What is occurring here is that Microsoft have not anticipated the possibilities of tablets, etc. having only enough disc space for the Windows platform and other secondary apps and software... which leave a pitiful amount of space left for Microsoft upgrades!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one thinking that if Microsoft switched their brain on for one minute and thought about this, then the whole upgrade process would actually take into account any inserted media like USB Flashdrives and/or SD Cards for the purpose of the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what people are complaining about and it's about time someone listened.&nbsp; Again Microsoft is being reactive (and damned slow about it) instead of being reactive.&nbsp; Only when Apple takes the monopoly and business off them will they ever listen and react.
 Typical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely if the Create Media Tool asks "please select" option for USB drives (in order to load update onto USB drives for updating another PC or Tablet with not enough memory) then the auto-update process should be developed to accommodate too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on... we are approaching 2020...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft with it's multi-billion empire can surely break into its profit and sort things like this out?</p>

<p>In all cases you should start with inserting your SD card (or USB stick) in the computer and have it formatted in NTFS format. Also assign it with a letter so that you recognize it as a drive (for example assign the letter O and name it "Win 10 ISO").</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>(Note: If you are planning to create an installation media with the USB, the USB will be reformatted in FAT format and you will not be able to use it for extra space during the upgrade process if/when your hard drive has limited capacity.)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>1. Visit the Microsoft site and go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download Windows 10 page</a>.<br />
2. Use the Media Creation tool to download the latest version of Windows 10.<br />
3. Choose not to upgrade now but rather download an ISO to upgrade later (be sure to select the correct Edition and architecture (32bit &nbsp; &nbsp; or 64bit) for your device.<br />
4. Save the ISO to the SD card (or USB stick) (formatted in NTFS) (a 32GB or above is recommended).<br />
5. Once the download is completed go to the SD/USB folder and right click the ISO file.<br />
6. Using a free program (for example WinRAR - www.rarlab.com - or 7zip - www.7-zip.org/) extract all &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; contents of the ISO file to a folder in the SD/USB.<br />
7. Open that folder and right click the setup.exe file using the "run as administrator" option.<br />
8. The program will reinstall Windows 10 in your computer and when prompted choose to keep your apps and files.<br />
9. When the installation program asks for more space, choose once again the SD card/USB stick. (In some &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; cases you may have to click on "Fix Issues", if presented, to be given the choice).
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the process you will have the latest Windows 10 edition installed.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>An Important Note: You should have the device connected to the charger through the entire process, so, if your tablet (or other device) has only one USB port then you will want/need to use the SD card method.</p>

<p>according to your description, you problem is that your hard drive do not have enough space for you to upgrade ASUS laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you need a larger hard drive. If you still use this hard drive on your computer, it will run out of space sooner or later. Thus, you'd better

Thanks, but this is a 32G laptop by design. There is no hard drive to replace. Additional storage can be added via micro SD card but the upgrade will not download to it.

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions that I supplied should have worked, perhaps I should have been more clear as to the exact intricacies of the procedure. I'll post them here again with some additions and bold print to highlight the most important parts to achieve success.
 I hope that this helps;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Visit the Microsoft site and go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

2. Use the Media Creation tool to download the latest version of Windows 10.<br />
3. <strong>Choose not to upgrade now but rather download the ISO file to use to perform the upgrade later</strong> (be sure to select the correct Edition and architecture (32bit or 64bit) for your device. (<strong>To do this, follow the instructions for Creating
 media to install on a different PC</strong>).<br />
4. Save the ISO to the SD card (or USB stick) (<strong>formatted in NTFS, you must reformat the SD card or the USB drive that you will be using to the NTSF format before beginning the download</strong>) (a
<strong>32GB</strong> or above&nbsp;<strong>quality brand name SD card or USB drive</strong> is recommended).<br />
5. <strong>Once the ISO file download is completed to the SD card (or USB drive) go to the resulting SD/USB folder and right click on the ISO file</strong>.<br />
6. <strong>Then, using a free program (for example WinRAR - www.rarlab.com - or 7zip - www.7-zip.org/) extract all</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

7. <strong>Then, open the resultant new folder and right click on the setup.exe file and select the "run as administrator" option</strong>.<br />
8. Then, <strong>choose the Upgrade Now option, the program will then proceed to upgrade (feature update) the installation of Windows 10 in your computer. When prompted, choose to keep your apps and files if/as that is your choice</strong>.<br />
9. When the installation program asks for more space, choose once again the SD card/USB stick. (<strong>In some</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>This has worked for thousands of people that are using devises with tiny and/or space restricted SSD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your still having problems after using this exact procedure, let us know, and include as much detailed information as you can concerning, we'll be glad to continue to help you further in resolving the issue.</p>

<h2>            Misuse of the System of Reports on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>2 days ago, during a game of Gears of War 4, [<strong>mod removed</strong>] sent a message to me and another Member of my team to report us 6&nbsp;times per day until&nbsp;we receive a ban. The threat came for no reason, just because they're losing the game. I have all the msg saved including the gamertags&nbsp; would report me.<br />
From what I read on sites, the misuse of the system of Reports goes against the Xbox Live Code of conduct and carries punishments to the author. I don't even know if he reported me, but this individual should do this every time&nbsp;he lose a game ... who knows how many players may already have been banned because of the action of this sore loser.</p>

    <title>NO sound, Just static.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brainfreezy  say:</h3>
<h2>            NO sound, Just static..</h2>
                    I JUST gotten this computer for christmas.<br />
and it's just spitting out static. Although it's<br />
new, I "updated" the sound card driver, and <br />
troubleshooted like crazy. And windows found<br />
no problem. <br />
<br />
I was wondering, while I was transporting<br />
the laptop, maybe I bumped it and caused<br />
the sound card to mess up. (if that's even <br />
possible)<br />
<br />
I checked alot of older related questions, <br />
and tried the answers but it didn't work for<br />
me :&lt; <br />
<br />
please help, thank you.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 App store and some apps not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iw11wfc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 App store and some apps not working</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has to be amongst the worst operating systems ever created, to say it is flaky is a complete understatement !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to do two complete clean installs of this operating system since it's release in July 2015 and now it looks like I could be facing a third one.. &nbsp;All of a sudden I noticed that my Photo App wasn't opening images and I receive a message stating
 that I will need to reinstall the app from the app store, so I click on the app store icon, and low and behold, that's not working either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the so called "Repair Tools" that are built into Windows 10, but guess what ??.. Yep you've guessed it, they don't work either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really is a case of "Should of stayed with windows 7", but again, guess what ?? Yep that's right, it won't let me revert back to Windows 7 either .. To say I am unimpressed with Windows and Microsoft is a total understatement, this is just bloody infuriating..
 &nbsp;Sort it out Microsoft for goodness sake, get it right for your customers and stop trying to compete with Apple all the time, put your effots into getting it right for the customers that you do already have !!!</p>

</p><p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response, I can confirm that I have tried all of your suggestions, sadly with no resolution to the issues that I am experiencing. &nbsp;One thing that I have notice now though, is that I don't have the Photo App at all now, it has disappeared
 from my system all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To both of your questions with reference to Error Message Numbers or Did I make any changes to the system, the answer is No I didn't and No I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really can't believe that an operating system that is supposed to be all singing and dancing can be so terrible.. &nbsp;How do I get back to Windows 7, because Windows 10 is shocking and no wonder it was free !! &nbsp;The reset function isn't working to reset my
 machine back to Windows 7 and as my system came pre installed with the operating system I don't have a disk to reinstall it either, can you advise me what you intend to do with regards to this issue ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
        </p>

            <p>This problem has nothing to do with the apps or the Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; All of the previous troubleshooting is irrelevant. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a new HP Envy that has worked perfectly for the past month...until today.&nbsp; I have made no changes or additions - the only "change" is the geographic location as this is occurring while we are on vacation in Montana.&nbsp; The problem just surfaced
 today when I tried to open a photo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Significant to troubleshooting this issue is the fact that the problem is isolated to only 1 of the 2 admin users set up on my laptop.&nbsp; All of my apps fail.&nbsp; The tiles are dead; the apps open a window which immediately closes, mostly with no error, but when
 run as the default app to open a file, results in "The remote procedure call failed" error.&nbsp; My husband, logged into his user account on my laptop has no problem--all apps function normally.&nbsp; That tells me there's nothing wrong with the apps or the Windows
 10 OS.&nbsp; It seems that this&nbsp;problem must be related an individual user's&nbsp;Microsoft Store account, like some kind of authentication is failing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A temporary workaround&nbsp;might be to create another user and&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;that until&nbsp;Microsoft comes up with the real fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on&nbsp;the length of time this issue has gone unresolved, I have little faith that will happen anytime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
