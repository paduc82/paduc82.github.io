<h2>            STOP&#58; c000021a &#123;Fatal System Error&#125; The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000 &#40;0xc0000001 0x0010081c&#41;.  The system has been shut down.</h2>
                    
<p>Background: Earlier today I was trying to figure out why the command prompt on my computer would not open.&nbsp; It would show on my Task Manager in the process tab but nowhere else.&nbsp; So I found a forum response (here, http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproperf/thread/ae38c898-1e90-40b9-b91c-de47f9f1adb5
 ) and tried to do what it said.&nbsp; After I made the changes it stated I went to restart my computer only to get the above listed error.&nbsp; Startup Repair stated it could not repair the computer automatically.</p>
<p>I get the same error when I try to safe mode or Last Known Good Configuration.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</strong> - has a section for if you can or can't start Windows.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>STOP: 0xC000021A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can be a difficult problem to solve and you may indeed need technical help from a real
<br />
computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System
<br />
maker's Support. <br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xC000021A: STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED<br />
<br />
</strong>The STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED bug check has a value of 0xC000021A. This means that an error has occurred in a crucial user-mode subsystem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED Parameters<br />
<br />
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. </p>

<strong><br />
Cause<br />
<br />
</strong>
<p>This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows
 cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution <br />
</strong><br />
Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</strong>
<br />
<br />
Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should
 be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending
 software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS startup disk to gain access to the computer's hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename
 or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove
 it to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p><br />
Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</strong> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service
 Pack is installed.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is my generic bluescreen troubleshooter - you can try Safe Mode as suggested in the article<br />
above - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.&nbsp;Windows disks are probably needed - if you do not have to try
<br />
repair you can borrow a friends as they are not copy protected. Also you can buy the physical
<br />
disks from the system maker cheap as you already own Windows (you will need these to reinstall
<br />
if&nbsp;required). You can also make repair disks on another computer.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Windows&nbsp;DVD or
<br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

========================================<br />
When ripping a CD with Windows Media Player you can<br />
choose, MP3, WMA, or WAV but I don't think WMP can<br />
do a simple conversion from one format to another.<br />
<br />
Based on your description I'm thinking a solution would <br />
be to convert all you files to WMA.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free - some retail...the following freeware<br />
is just one example.:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake - Free Audio Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_audio_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_audio_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your music file's on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Audio button and Browse to the <br />
folder your music files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your music files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMA icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; Choose <br />
a "Save To" folder so you can find the converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and the files should be <br />
converted very quickly.<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />

            <p>Windows update is running and doesn't show Western digital driver as available. I clicked on uninstall driver from device manager and rebooted but it didn't try to reinstall the WD driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that is one of the issues I have. the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (KB4013429) fails to install. several errors in the eventlog but nothing that makes sense to me. so I used the hide/show updates tool to hide the cumulative update and
 it quit trying to install it for a week or so and then yesterday it started trying to install it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the update history and it shows the Cumulative update failing to install again. also as I looked through the update history it showed the Western Digital driver update failed several times the last on 2/25/17. then it quit trying. Strange thing
 is the update it was trying to install was released in October 2015. </p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems like all these other issues started when the Cumulative Update was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me know if I can supply any more info or point me in the direction of diagnostic tools.

            <p>I have tried the solutions in the link including successfully running the DISM.EXE to no avail. So short of reinstalling Windows which is very difficult to do since this was an upgrade from Windows 7 so their is no media to install from, I am out of solutions.
 Note it is an Update that is failing not an Upgrade. Would appreciate any additional guidance you can give. I can also provide and additional info
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the Cumulative Update as the system is closing windows for restart the following error (copied from event viewer) occurs. and so after restart it installs the Cumulative Update and tells me it needs to restart. this is a never ending loop.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Greg, that's the issue. when I open Disk management the WD Passport USB drive doesn't show so I cant assign a drive. when I open device manager the Passport shows in other devices. when I open Settings - Devices - Connected Devices it shows "My Passport
 Ultra" but says driver is unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I do a clean install of Windows 10 do I have to reinstall all my Software? they have been accumulated over the years and not sure I have the install source for all of them.</p>

            HI CH.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See fixes for the error here:
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/43-errors-explained-2619238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/43-errors-explained-26...</a>
<br />
<br />For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay, see if the Device is listed.  From it's dropdown menu change it to what you want it to do when plugged in.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br /> Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Overwrite My Save Game On Clouds, Can i Restore this &#63;</h2>
                    Due to some of the problems that occurred in my account and Xbox, I had to delete all my Save Games (from the Setting -&gt; Storage -&gt; Clear Save Data) menu, then to make sure that the operation was done correctly I opened one of the games to see if it was
 deleted by Save Game, then I connected the Xbox to the Internet and logged in to my account and I opened the same game again, but unfortunately it was wrong to sync instead of the Cloud option, From Storage option I chose to delete my previous Save Game and
 OverWrite the Save New<br />
How can I restore the previous save?

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; Game saves are stored on both the Cloud and the console.&nbsp; If you accidentally overwrote a save on the Cloud then I'm afraid there is no way to recover it.&nbsp; You'll need to continue from where you are now.

<h2>            Skype to go is not working. How can I get to the skype to go help desk&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI! </p>
<p>so I have Skype to go and during the last week every time I call a number the connection fails.
</p>
<p>It rings several times, and by the time the person answers we can't hear each other. I tried this calling different phone numbers, from my cell and my land line and it doesn't work.
</p>
<p>Also tried to delete some numbers and adding them again but it's still failing.</p>
<p>How can I get in contact with somebody from the Skype service? otherwise I will have to cancel my service with skype to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.
 In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is
 disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
After disabling antivirus, you may try to install the updates in Clean Boot state. Refer the following article.<br />
</span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Once you are done with clean boot, please follow step 7 in the article to set your computer
 back to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>You may refer the following article.<br />
</span><strong><span>Unable to install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2</span></strong><span><br />

<b>Important</b>: The above mentioned article contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

</span></b><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the
 hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
</span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Make sure that you back up the data before proceeding with Check disk.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi Sumit, I've followed your thread with <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/20b9da7a-86f6-4fd4-a1fd-65eef06cf809" title="richardliu2015">
Richardliu2015 </a>about Windows 10 updates which are stuck. I have this same problem. So far, I've downloaded and run the Wureset batch file but without success. I see you've also mentioned a Windows Update Troubleshooter utility. Is it OK to run this With
 Windows 10? I'm not a technical sort of person and am always afraid of breaking something by doing the wrong thing!</p>
<p>Thanks, Jay</p>

    <title>Cursor disappears on Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldchabot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor disappears on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    Cursor often disappears and is replaced by a gray rectangle on the right side of the screen. Sometimes I can slide the rectangle away, and it turns into a circle or disappears and the cursor comes back. But if I have a program open, then the cursor can
 not be recovered, and I have to reboot.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we continuously press the Shift key 5 times the computer will a bleep sound and pop up will come up asking if you want to turn on sticky keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn off the dialog box and thus relieve the annoyance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start → type&nbsp;Ease of Access → Make the keyboard easier to use.</p>
<p>2. Locate the “Make it easier to type” heading.</p>
<p>3. Remove the check mark from the box next to “Turn on Sticky Keys”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note:<strong> Sticky</strong> <strong>Keys</strong> is an accessibility feature to help a
<strong>computer</strong> user who has physical disabilities. It essentially serialized keystrokes instead of having to press multiple
<strong>keys</strong> at the same time which makes pressing combinations of <strong>
keys</strong> a lot easier because the <strong>keys</strong> remain active until any other
<strong>key</strong> is pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED blue screen on Samsung Notebook</h2>
                    My laptop will try and start up and then instead of going to the login screen, a blue screen comes up which states:<br />
<br />
"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />
PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED<br />
<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.<br />
<br />
If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching and shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup
 Options, and then select safe mode.<br />
<br />
Technical information:<br />
***STOP: 0x0000006B (0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)<br />
<br />
Collecting data for crash dump...<br />
Initializing disk for crash dump...<br />
Beginning dump of physical memory.<br />
Dumping physical memory to disk: "<br />

It then will restart itself and usually go to a black screen that asks me if i want to go to system repair. I have tried that and it says it failed to do a system repair every time. I've also tried starting in safe mode and that doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
Please Help!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I see that you are unable to boot to normal and safe mode also getting an error "STOP: 0x0000006B ".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Quick questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a brand-new computer?</span>
</li><li>
<span>What anti-virus application or security is installed on the computer?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On my research I found that on a computer that is running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, if you uninstall McAfee Agent 4.6.2 and restart
 the computer. The computer crashes during the startup process. Additionally, you receive a Stop Error message that is similar to one you have mentioned on your post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>You receive "0x0000006B" and "0XC000021A" Stop error message after uninstalling McAfee Agent 4.6.2 in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008
 R2</span></strong></p>

<p><span>You may try the steps from the following link and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Windows Vista or Windows 7 no longer starts and the Startup Repair tool does not fix the problem</span></b><span><br />

<p>Things are getting a little tight. Assuming that the problem lies with some inappropriate setting in the registry, you can restore the registry files manually to an earlier point by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires
 some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area. Note that it might reset your password to an earlier value.</p>
<p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu.<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I shall call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; cd &nbsp;/d &nbsp;Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; xcopy &nbsp;*.* &nbsp;Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; cd &nbsp;RegBack<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?<br />
9. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y software &nbsp;..<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y System &nbsp;..<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can replace Steps 1 . . 5 by booting the machine with your Windows Repair CD.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro Screen Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank.lithium  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Screen Glitch</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have had my 128GB Surface Pro model for approximately 3 months now, and the entire device had been operating smoothly until last Wednesday. Normally, when I need to wake the device from sleep mode, I would just press the power button, however that method
 didn't work on that day. When I rebooted the device, the screen suddenly began flickering erratically at the start screen, growing ever dimmer, until the screen appeared to be shut off again. It was only upon close examination of the screen that I discovered
 the screen wasn't shut off, but <b>extremely</b> dark.<br />
<br />
After repeating this exercise a few more times, I decided to refresh the device, and things appeared normal for the rest of the evening; I covered the screen with the touch cover just for experimentation, and lo and behold, the device was (and still is) having
 the same problem as that of Wednesday evening.<br />
<br />
I really like my device you guys, it was operating smooth as butter until last Wednesday, and I would really appreciate if anyone, including those with experience in similar issues, could help me resolve this matter before I am forced into the hassle of restoring
 it or trading in a new one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Appreciations in advance!<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Frank<br />

<h2>            Captures folder gone and I can&#39;t record games</h2>
                    <p>I recently took my ssd out of raid 0. I believe that my Captures folder was on these drives. There is no way to get that folder back since they have been formatted since then. Now, when I try to record and says "can't save files. please make sure captures
 folder allows files to be saved." When I check where captures are saved, there is nothing. No location what so ever. I made a new Captures folder and put it in the videos folder, but this didn't work either. I think i need to add this folder into the registry
 or something. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            I've pretty much tried everything I could find in the forums and ms help. When I'm in settings, game bar will not stay on. I turn it on but when i go back into settings it's off. I've tried to change attributes in the Captures folder, that I created in
 videos, such as sharing with everyone and permissions. I honestly think that I have to create an original folder using the registry, if that is possible. I also went into the registry and followed a suggestion about setting a couple values to 1 instead of
 zero but that did not help either. Still looking for a solution. Thanks

<p>I tried this and many others. Another thing that might help is that in the xbox app, when I go to DVR, it just says something went wrong while trying to load this information please try again later. This is what I've tried:</p>
<p>1. the above suggestion.</p>
<p>2. creating a new captures folder.</p>
<p>3. adding in values of 1 to the registry on local machine..dvr and saves. (not sure what the total process was anymore but found by googling)</p>
<p>4. resetting videos folder to default location since there is no captures folder.</p>
<p>5. and a few others i can't recall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said before, my captures folder was on my D drive (i think) and when I took that drive out of raid 0, not even thinking about the captures folder, I think I lost that original folder. If there is a way to introduce a new captures folder into windows,
 that's what i think i need to do, via registry probably. Thanks for all the help and responses. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've tried this, but the probably is that there is no folder location in the dvr settings. it is just blank where there should be a saves folder. I created a captures folder in videos, but this did not work either. Thanks though.</p>
