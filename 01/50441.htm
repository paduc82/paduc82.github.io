    <title>War Thunder Terms ARE not clearly Disclosed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            War Thunder Terms ARE not clearly Disclosed</h2>
                    This one of the most expensive games I have ever played. Gamers need to continual in-app purchases after getting a new airplane. You can play the game without it; however you will be at a significant disadvantage and likely to be the become the prey amongst
 the other players most of whom are heavily invested in this cross-platform game. However, this part IS listed under general terms.<br />
However, I have learned in a hard way after spending hundreds of dollars that, the game is structured in a way that is absurdly UNFAIR for XBOX players. And you can easily find this in many other forums. This issue stems from the fact that game inserts brand
 new players (which includes many of the console players) with the very experienced players against each other at every level of the game. In other words, it might be your first fight, and you will be playing against gamers who have been playing this game since
 2013. I have played against players at RANK 3 out of the nine ranks, who had over 100,000 planes killed.
<br />
After having four months of getting killed all the time, and investing heavily upgrading the airplanes and still not displaying considerable improvements, I started a search for the gamers stats, particularly for the newcomers. And I could not find anything.
 So, I started looking at the stats after the end of each game I have played. (STATS include several key measures for an individual player; how many airplanes killed, how many games played, and the critical measure what is the player's success rate). That's
 when I found an incredible amount of UNFAIR discrepancies. HAVE I BEEN TOLD SUCH PRACTICES I WOULD HAVE NEVER INVESTED IN THIS GAME?<br />
Players can play at any RANK. I player, who has been playing this game since 2013, who has killed over 100,000 airplanes can play with a player who is playing his 1st game. A new player has NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER AGAINST SUCH PLAYERS. THIS is not mentioned anywhere
 explicitly within the terms of the agreement. However, in the forums, they indicate that you can turn off the cross-play option in the game an play only against the XBOX players. There are a limited number of players in the XBOX community and doing such changes
 the entire experience of the game. AGAIN THIS IS NOT STATED IN THE TERMS. <br />
This game is not made for Xbox controls. You will have to invest in purchasing a decent mouse and keyboard. You can use your Xbox controllers, but this game requires precise shooting at various angles in matters of milliseconds at high speeds. Not build for
 hand controllers. Such a necessity to purchase a KEYBOARD and MOUSE is not stated in their terms.<br />
Playing with experienced players is very frustrating. Don't take this lightly.&nbsp; 65% to 80% of the airplanes are killed by the top 2 -4 people in a match.<br />
GAME HAS IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES FOR XBOX PLAYERS. It freezes 90 % of the time when you are in the hangar, modifying your airplanes.<br />
65% of the time airplanes disappear on your screen. I have been shot by many ghost airplanes.<br />
WORST PART IS; They have almost no support for XBOX players. AND IN THEIR FORUM, it indicates that there is NO NEAR TERM PLAN TO SUPPORT IT. I think Microsoft should not include a game just because it is popular amongst the many PC players while having nearly
 no support for the XBOX players.<br />
GRAPHICS are terrible for the XBOX players. Let me Explain, although the environment and planes look so awesome and realistic when it comes down the shooting everything suffers. The fast-moving target a merely 2mm faint circle is tough to notice and next to
 impossible to see in some environments such as snow or rocky mountains. IN PCs, players can alter settings to match their eyesight (With or without glasses). Such options are not available for Xbox users. IF YOU can't shoot well, You can't play this game,
 AND if you can't see the circle well, you can't shoot well.<br />
AND GAME LAGGING; Their US servers are horrible. With ping consistently over 63 and latency at 2% to 5%, you are trying to shoot at airplanes that were there 2 seconds ago. They blame the users' internet connection speeds or users not setting the XBOX ports
 correctly. I am pretty savvy at this. And I have set up the ports accurately. XBOX ping is under 45 ms, latency 0. Our internet speed is at 200 Mb/s. Problem is in their servers!<br />
<br />
Overall, this game is very expensive and not ready for XBox. I don't know why MICROSOFT agreed to sell a game without meaningful technical support. UNFAIR player match system is not displayed accurately anywhere. Many of the glitches that have been present
 four months ago are still there present today with no plan per their forum post, is insight.

            Contacting the game makers directly is the best way to go since this game is not a Microsoft made game.

<h2>            I CAN&#39;T LOG IN TO MY ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a new e-mail address and then went&nbsp;t make a new Microsoft account with it. After that, I then created a new "User account" on my laptop (Windows 10 Home) and made it as the administrator and removed administrator rights from my past account (it was
 then just a local account). As I did that, the laptop restarted all of a sudden because it had some updates to install on Windows and after that nothing was the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't:</p>
<p>-&nbsp; log in to my administrator account (I get the ''The user profile service failed the sign in'' message)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; install any of the new programs (when I get asked to write the administrative password I then write it down and nothing happens)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; open anything in administrator mode (I get the ''Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\System32\*name*.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, then try again.'' message)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; reinstall windows with the option of keeping my files (I get the ''There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made.'' message)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been battling this problem for almost 2-3 months and finally I decided to write it here in hope of someone having the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>XBOX ONE Rise of the Tomb Raider and Preview Dashboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous7571  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE Rise of the Tomb Raider and Preview Dashboard</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased this game on 25/12/15 and played it once on that day, I also downloaded some other games at the same time.&nbsp; Since then I had the latest Preview dashboard install on the console, now the Rise of the Tomb Raider will not launch.&nbsp; I get the sound
 when clicking the tile to launch the game but nothing, no errors.&nbsp; I can even navigate to another game and click that and that game will launch as expected.</p>
<p>I have logged support cases with XBOX support references 1335473173 and 1335507819.&nbsp; I have also been passed to the developer forum which has revealed absolutely nothing and in fact their forum suggests that XBOX Support is where I should go for help!</p>
<p>For some reason I get Group not Found when trying to get to the Preview forum, so MS Support suggested that I log my issue here and hopefully someone can help me get the game working.</p>
<p>I am happy to go through all the steps I have taken to try and get this game working, but if you can check the support logs you should be able to find out all of this before hand.</p>
<p>Here is hoping that someone form the Preview programme can assist me,</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Keith</p>

<p>Most people in this forum are just Xbox gamers like you, so we can only make some suggestions.</p>
<p>For what it's worth...</p>
<p>Have already uninstalled the game and re-installed it?</p>
<p>Press Menu button, select Manage Game, Manage All, then Uninstall All. This will remove everything relating to the game, including your game save. However, when you re-install the game, and assuming you are able to launch it this time, it will sync with
 the cloud and download any previous game saves.</p>
<p>If that fails, try playing the game using another account/guest account to see if it's your profile data which is corrupted. If it launches with that then the problem is with your game save. You will probably need to delete your cloud saves. To do this,
 go to Manage Game as before, but this time move to Saved Data, press menu, and select Delete Saved Data. You will be given the option to delete it just from your console or the cloud as well. Be warned, that this cannot be undone so if you want to keep a previous
 save then you might want to try something else first. It will be like playing the game for the first time.</p>
<p>A more drastic step would be to remove your profile, power-cycle your console, and restore your profile (you'll need your email address and password). This will remove the game saves for every game and all user data from your console, but it will not remove
 any of the games themselves (unless you manually uninstall them). Then next time you play a game it will sync your data and re-download your game saves; this can take time. I'd only do this as an absolute last resort and there are no guarantees it would even
 work anyway.</p>
<p>I hope you sort this because it is a fantastic game.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>Yes I was told that some of the preview moderators also come into this forum and hopefully would see this.</p>
<p>As for your suggestions I have done them all along with others suggested by XBOX Support, I have also downloaded my profile on to another XBOX One and then installed the game on their which then works.</p>
<p>To me it points at the fact I have the Preview Dashboard on my console, it does only effect this one game though and all others work fine.</p>
<p>The developer forum still has not resulted in any responses to my issue, which being honest I find some what disheartening considering they have had the money for the game.</p>
<p>I have been passed a contact phone number via Twitter now from XBOX Support, so I will pursue that avenue tomorrow and see if I can get the game working again.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I know you tried your profile on another console, but, out of interest, have you tried downloading someone else's profile to your console and running the game? However, I think you're probably onto something with the preview program being the root of the
 problem. I'm on the program too and experiencing other problems: syncing game saves with the cloud and achievements not unlocking. Neither am I the only one on the program suffering these problems. I am considering removing myself from the program at the moment
 as, like many others, we continually report problems and nothing gets done about it.</p>
<p>I really hope that the phone support is able to help you sort your problem. Let us know.</p>

<p>i had this problem with the definitive edition of tomb raider...i purchases it on 9/16/15 when it was free(Games for Gold in September) and on my console it said i needed to buy it for $30....checked my account and the purchase of the game wasn't listed......so
 i rolled back the preview dashboard today...and now my enrollment is pending...and i bought it for $30 last night because waiting for a reply on having a way to re-install it without buying it would take too long..i don't know if it was a glitch with the dash
 or the website itself to make it so my account didn't show that it was purchased at that time...</p>
<p>if there is a way to do that...can anyone post it ...that way i can call Xbox support and get a refund for the game</p>

<h2>            Webcam Problem with Lenovo T510</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded a Lenovo ThinkPad T-510 from Windows 7 to Windows 8. A problem has developed with the webcam which worked perfectly prior to the upgrade. The Windows 8 installed driver does not work although device manager reports that it is working properly. But
 the device will not show a picture. The digitally signed Microsoft drivers installed are ksthunk.sys and usbvideo.sys, file version 6.2.9200.16384 (win8_rtm.120725-1247).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have considered uninstalling them to see if windows will proper driver, but have not seen in guidance about doing this. This is a known issue, there are others that have the same problem&nbsp; and have been given no solutions.</p>

    <title>Will not print Images in Black &#38; White only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will not print Images in Black &#38; White only</h2>
                    
<p>I have a HP Pavilion running Windows 7 with a Canon "Pixma MP150" printer. I have it setup to print Black &amp; white only. However, when I scan in a Document &amp; try to print it I get a message:</p>
<p>"The following ink cartridge will be used for the specified printing. Color</p>
<p>The settings in the Ink Cartridge Settings on the Maintenance tab of the printer driver will be disabled."</p>
<p>It then proceeds to print a blank page since I do not have a Color Cartridge in the printer.</p>

    <title>How do I change my Media keys to actually work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -victoria24  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change my Media keys to actually work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an ancient mechanical keyboard which has the shortcut keys to play, skip and the volume keys, only somewhere along the line my keys are all mixed up, the volume down button opens the calculator and the replay stops the track, while volume up and skip
 don't work at all, the only thing that works is the stop and play buttons, is there a way to actually fix this? I've been through all the keyboard options on my computer and none of them have the option to change this.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<p>In order for special keys on your keyboard to function properly, you have to install the appropriate software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your "ancient mechanical keyboard"?&nbsp; Of course, if it is too "ancient," there may not be a version of the required software that will run on you (unidentified) version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't identify the keyboard from a label on the bottom, open Device Manager (click Start, type Device Manager in the Search box, press Enter) and look in the "Keyboards" category.</p>

<p>The model is: IBM, KB-9930 back from in the old XP Days. (if not 95/98)</p>
<p>I'm currently running in windows 7.</p>
<p>I'm just really confused how the "volume down" button has become "Open calculator"</p>

<p>Unfortunately, although that old keyboard may be mechanically better than modern keyboards, there is no longer any software support for it.&nbsp; As near as I can determine, drivers for this keyboard were only produced up to Windows XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even XP drivers are
 now only available from sketchy download sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what "keyboard options" you may have tried, but the place to look is in the Control Panel.&nbsp; If you select "View by small icons" in the upper right corner of Control Panel, you can then find and click the "Keyboard" control panel icon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's marginally possible that you might find something in the Start &gt; All Programs list or in the list of installed programs (click Start, type Programs and Features).</p>

    <title>PC with Windows 8.1&#58; stopped loging in using normal Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g2_destiny  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC with Windows 8.1&#58; stopped loging in using normal Windows Account password</h2>
                    OS: Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
After upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, I used my PC system without any significant problems for several weeks.<br />
<br />
Three days ago, Windows 8.1 stopped accepting my normal Windows Account password.
<br />
<br />
Now, when I try to log-in, the system replies "Your PC is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this PC". I do this, but it won't accept this last password.<br />
<br />
The reason the PC is offline is that I set its NIC to "disabled", when I leave it for longish periods.<br />
<br />
How can I recover this situation without completely re-installing the Windows 8.1 ?<br />
<br />
(I want to avoid all the collateral annoyances)

            <p>You might be able to reset it using the built-in Administrator account.</p>

<li>Details: The built-in administrator account that comes with your computer should be disabled at all times, and only used for emergency situations, like restoring your computer or resetting some other user's password.</li></ul>
<p>You can reset your forgotten password from any other administrator-level account. If there are no other Administrator accounts on the system, you can boot to Safe Mode to access the Built-in Administrator account and use it for this suation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>WinKey+I</strong> (that's an <em>i </em>) to display Settings, click the
<strong>Power Options</strong> icon, then&nbsp;<strong>hold down Shift </strong>while you click the
<strong>Restart</strong> option.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>On the first screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot, </strong>then <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next screen, select
<strong>Startup Settings</strong>. Click the <strong>Restart</strong> Button.&nbsp; On the next screen, press the
<strong>Number 4</strong> Key.&nbsp; The computer will start in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click the Arrow Icon on the login screen and select the <strong>Administrator</strong> account.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>After Safe Mode starts, open Control Panel (Press WinKey+X to get there easily) then
<strong>User Accounts</strong>.&nbsp; Select <em>Manage another account </em>and select the account you wish to change to an Administrator account.&nbsp; Select
<strong>Change Account Type</strong>.&nbsp; Select the Administrator option and click the Change account type button.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Exit Control Panel and Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Log on with the account you changed to an Administrator account.&nbsp; It should now have full access to the computer.</li></ol>

            <p>That's not likely -- there is always an administrator account that is hidden until you get to step 3 in those steps.&nbsp; It comes automatically with the system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It would have been very difficult for you to remove the administrator account, so unless you took extreme&nbsp;measures to erase it, it should still be there for you.</p>

            Kevin, thanks for your excellent reply. <br />
It helped me understand the situation, but as yet there is no solution.&nbsp; Each route that I follow ends in a request for a password (which I cannot correctly supply).<br />
<br />
Below I have given additional details which may trigger useful thoughts from you (or the others).<br />
Please let me know if I have written too much<br />
-&nbsp; this is the first time I have used a communty site like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
RESULTS OF FOLLOWING YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ==&gt; <br />
<br />
After completing Instruction 2 my PC re-started, but showed no direct indication that it was running in Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />
A log-in page displayed my Microsoft Account name: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
This did not accept its password.<br />
<br />
Clicking the large Arrow Icon displayed possible selection of either of my two Microsoft Accounts: "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"&nbsp; Neither account accepted its password.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUESTION 1 <br />
I could see no sign of the disabled built-in Administrator account. <br />
Is the Administrator Account restricted to being a Local Account ?<br />
<br />
QUESTION 2<br />
Is it possible that I could have renamed the built in Administrator Account<br />
<br />
QUESTION 3<br />
Who is responsible for judging if this problem is important and worth following up and sorting out ?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM<br />
<br />
1<br />
No similar problem occured during year that I was running Windows 8<br />
<br />
2<br />
The problem started on 25/11/2013.<br />
It seems associated with the NIC being disabled (disconnecting the network), and the "last password memory" somehow becoming corrupted<br />
- see Note H below and my original posting on this site.<br />
<br />
3<br />
At present the only known solution is to carry out a re-installation of Windows 8.1, and then avoid disabling the NIC.
<br />
(In my case a reinstalation of Windows 8, then an upgrade too Windows 8.1 wuld be necessary.)<br />
-&nbsp; these are strictly temporary measures.<br />
<br />
4<br />
Probably the problem would not occur if only Local Accounts were used.<br />
<br />
5<br />
The problem appears fundemental. <br />
If so, its cause should be understood and corrected<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SUPPORTING NOTES<br />
<br />
A <br />
I can still successfully access both my Microsoft Accounts via "login.live.com"<br />
<br />
B:<br />
For several weeks I was running the PC under Windows 8.1<br />
I disabled the NIC card overnight, in order to disconnect the PC from the internet as a safety measure.<br />
When I logged into the session next morning there was a comment that the PC was not connected to the network, but the password was always connected on second attempt.&nbsp; The problem started on 25/11/2013<br />
<br />
C: <br />
Rebuen Caldron reported a very similar problem on 17/11/2013.&nbsp; See:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/cant-login-to-windows-81/eaae8950-1197-45a0-9992-3d1caa1c9d48<br />
<br />
D: &nbsp;<br />
Before upgrading to Windows 8.1 I had only used local accounts.<br />
So I initially tried to avoid using Microsoft Accounts, <br />
but&nbsp; ... ... this produced its own inconveniences.<br />
<br />
So I played arround for some time with both Local Accounts and Microsoft Accounts to understand their characteristics.
<br />
I hope this has not upset the built-in Administrator Account.<br />
<br />
E: &nbsp;<br />
At one stage, after logging in to Microsoft Account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, <br />
I inadvertantly changed its password (while pursuing another problem). <br />
This was done during the last session before the password problem crippled my PC.<br />
<br />
F: &nbsp;<br />
I think the PC may have installed one of the Microsoft Windows S/W Updates during the morning the password problem started.<br />
<br />
G: &nbsp;<br />
Also during this last session, I de-installed the software for my "WD My Book World II" NAS back-up system, since this was not supported by Windows 8.1<br />

Hi Shawn ':-)<br />
<br />
My PC is a Novatech NTI18 64-bit with Windows 8 professional (upgraded to W8.1)<br />
<i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Press <b>WinKey+I</b> (that's and i) to display Settings, click the <b>
Power Options</b> icon,<br />
</i><i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; then <b>hold down Shift</b> while you click the <b>Restart
</b>option.</i><br />
<br />
I have just turned on and restarted the system to make sure that it is at the very beginning.<br />
It is displaying the Lock Screen.<br />
<br />
"Press <b>WinKey+I"<br />
</b>I press the WinKey, then the Shift-key&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; the display immediately changes to the Log-on Screen<br />
or<br />
I press WinKey, then i key &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; the display immediately changes to the Log-on Screen<br />
or<br />
I left-click Lock Screen with mouse &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; the display immediately changes to the Log-on Screen&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Below he Log-in icon and and Log-in text box,&nbsp; the bottom of the Log-in Screen I see four icons.<br />
When I hover the cursor over these and then move left to right, I see they are labelled:<br />
"Ease of Access"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Connect to internet"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "English KB"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shut Down"<br />
<br />
I click on the "Shut Down" icon =&gt; a sub menu appears =&gt;&nbsp; [Sleep]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Shut down]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Restart]<br />
<br />
I hold down left-hand Shift Key, and click on [Restart] =&gt;&nbsp; "Choose an option" screen is displayed
<br />
<br />
I select "Troubleshoot"&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; on the Trouble shoot screen I select "Advanced Options"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; on the first Start-up Settings screen I click [Restart]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; the PC restarts and displays a second Start-up Settings&nbsp; screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; menu with&nbsp; selection numbers 1 - 9,&nbsp; 4 is Enable Safe Mode<br />
<br />
I press number 4 key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; the system reboots<br />
<br />
On completion of reboot a Log-on Screen is displayed, <br />
This is similar to the normal "clean start" Log-on Screen, but with the following differences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; Log-on Account Name dimensions are 55 x 6.5 mm&nbsp; (normal 43 x 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; Log-on Account Image dimensions are 65 x 70 mm &nbsp; (normal 52.5 x 52.5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; Password text box&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dimensions are 100 x 11 mm (normal 80 x 9)<br />
<br />
Using the left-arrow ikon next to the Log-on Account Image, either of two accounts can be selected<br />
I was unable to log into either of these two accounts:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; John Smith *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (default)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; John Smith *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; (used for experimentation)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

********************************************************<br />
<br />
I am very grateful for your reply&nbsp; (and also for the previous replies from Shawn)<br />
<br />
Route that you are suggesting was route I wished to take, but I had no Windows 8 DVD (or USB)&nbsp;
<br />
- new PC I had bought had Windows 8 pre-loaded, but no Windows 8 DVD/USB<br />
- guess I should have created Windows 8 DVD/US&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Question</b>: is this is possible?<br />
- guess I should have familiarised myself with Window 8 (and 8.1) system management<br />
<br />
My problems started after I upgraded to Windows 8.1 (and started using Microsoft Account)<br />
- fortunately most of my most important data was backed up on a NAS via my Netbook<br />
<br />
Because I wanted to get my main PC up and running with Windows 8.1 as soon as possible,<br />
I decided to live with loss of some data, and went by the route:<br />
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>a. </font></span></span><font><font>normal Boot&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; Login screen&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; shutdown sub-menu&nbsp; ==&gt; restart + shift<br />
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>b. system re-booted ==&gt;&nbsp; Troubleshoot ==&gt;&nbsp; Reset your PC&nbsp; (no password required here !)</font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>c. </font></span></span><font><font>Re-install Windows 8&nbsp;&nbsp; ==&gt; upgrade to Windows 8.1<br />
</font></font></font></p>

</font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Windows 8.1 system management</font></span><br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><font>I tried to</font></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font> provoke my original password problem, but so far with no success.
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Since I am not the only person who has reported this problem, I will investigate again later.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<b>Question</b>:&nbsp; when I eventually understand how I got into this silly situation,
<br />
is there someone (some place) that I should report my findings to ??<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks to you and to Shawn for your help<br />

            Hi,
<div>I have a similar problem with Windows 8. &nbsp;The other day Windows 8 would not accept my password. &nbsp;I went to accounts.live/password/reset and changed my login.live password expecting that I should now be able to log in to my PC with the new password.</div>
<div>However, I still could not log into my PC using the new password although I could use it to log into login.live. &nbsp;I did discover that I could log into the command prompt using my original password. &nbsp;When I checked the local Administrator account it was
 already active but it will not come up on any login screen. &nbsp;I can only see my windows account.</div>
<div>What can I do to make the Administrator username visible.at the login screen? &nbsp;If I can log in using Administrator will I be able to reset my windows account password on my PC?</div>
<div>When I type in net user at the cmd prompt &nbsp;the only accounts shown are administrator and guest.</div>

<p>I posted instructions above in this conversation about how to get into the administrator account and do exactly what you are trying (go into Admin and reset the other accounts' password).<br />

    <title>How do I remove the KB963707 update to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idomeneus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the KB963707 update to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have been trying to remove .NET from my Windows XP Pro SP3 system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I used “Add or Remove Programs” to remove the .NET versions in reverse order (4 first, then 3.5, and so on).<span>&nbsp;
</span>That appeared to be successful until I switched on “Show updates” in “Add or Remove Programs”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then discovered that “Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (KB963707)” still remained as a sub-item of “Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I tried to remove the update by clicking “Remove”, I was informed that “This action is only valid for products that are currently installed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This makes sense in a way because .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 has been uninstalled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, it does beg the question as to why the update was not uninstalled at the same time.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I looked at the article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/963707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/963707</u></a> and tried to follow the instructions to remove the .NET Framework Assistant for Firefox but neither the specified registry entry nor the specified directory is present on my system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(And Firefox has never been installed on my system.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I used the .NET Cleanup Tool (cleanup_tool.exe) to cleanup all .NET versions, both with and without MSE real-time protection running, but the update stubbornly remains listed in “Add or Remove Programs”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, I have manually deleted the C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET directory containing the remnants of the .NET files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I search for the string “KB963707” in the registry, I find various references to KB963707, but I feel diffident about indiscriminately deleting all registry entries containing this string.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Does anyone have any further ideas on how to remove this update?<span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>Does anyone have any further ideas on how to remove this update?<span>&nbsp; </span>
Alternatively, if it seems highly likely that the update has already been removed, perhaps someone might know which registry entries I can safely delete in order to remove the listing of the update in “Add or Remove Programs”?</span>

            <p>One way to get rid of it is to reinstall .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 and then install KB963707.</p>
<p>Next uninstall KB963707 and then .Net 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p>Run the cleanup tool and again delete the .Net directory.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw Puzzle Statistics are completely messed up.</h2>
                    Recently, I discovered that I could not load a few puzzles in 3 different collections and so I reinstalled Microsoft Jigsaw Puzzles. My statistics were completely messed up.&nbsp;My Completed puzzles score went from 2216 to 0, my score went from 352500 to a
 NEGATIVE&nbsp;-104410. My collections completed&nbsp;in easy, medium, hard and expert remained correct at 48, 48, 48, and 3 respectively and the stars under each puzzle I completed remained lit up. There are 2216 stars lit up and I still have a NEGATIVE score. Is there
 any way this can be fixed???

<p>Hey Leute, Ich habe nun seit Jahren das Magazin GamePRO, doch langsam habe ich die Schnauze voll! Warum? Weil Sie für mich immer mehr zu einer SonyPRO wird! Das soll jetzt nicht heißen das ich Sony nicht mag, aber Unparteiisch ist die GamePRO schon lange
 nicht mehr. Seht selbst http://www.gamepro.de/playstation/artikel/specials/3024880/playstation_4_und_xbox_one_im_vergleich.html Allein schon bei der Überschrift könnte ich Ko**en! Hat hier irgendjemand ein Tipp für mich welche Magazine gut sind?? Besten Dank!

<p>Dann bist wohl nur drüber geflogen, oder? Es werden Fakten aufgezählt welche nicht wirklich der Wahrheit entsprechen. Ein Beispiel.</p>
<p>Laut Gamepr: Das neue Kinect erkennt sogar, wieviele Personen sich im Raum aufhalten – so sollen möglicherweise die Kosten für Film-Streaming auf Basis der anwesenden Zuschauer gestaffelt werden.</p>
<p>Das stimmt nicht, es wurde lediglich ein Patent eingereicht das sowas mal bezwecken kann.</p>
<p>Außerdem werden nur die Vorteile der PS4 aufgezählt, bei der ONE werden die meisten verschwiegen.
</p>
<p>Wieder ein Beispiel: </p>
<p>Laut Gamepro: 20 exklusive Spiele in den ersten zwölf Monaten, davon bereits sieben angekündigte wie Killzone: Shadow Fall und bislang 52 nicht exklusive Titel erscheinen für die Playstation 4. Die Xbox One erhält im ersten Jahr lediglich 15 Exklusivtitel,
 davon sind 13 schon bekannt und nur 36 Multiplattform-Spiele.</p>
<p>Hier wird die ONE (meiner Meinung nach) schlecht dargestellt.</p>
<p>Für weitere Beispiele solltest du dir mal die Kommentare durchlesen bei der GamePRO (hab jetzt nicht so viel Zeit alles aufzulisten:))</p>
<p>Aber egal! Da ich das Heft fast von Anfang an hatte, habe ich nun gemerkt das Sie immer mehr in Richtung Sony abschweift.</p>
<p>Aber könntest mir trotzdem deine Empfehlung geben welches Heft noch gut ist:).</p>
<p>Greetz Nr 70</p>
<p>PS: da ich vom IPad geschrieben habe, sind möglicherweise die Umbrüche komisch. Also Sorry hierfür.</p>

            Hi  papabear631, have you tried manually installing that update from the Windows 10 ISO?
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            I solved this problem by installing the free IOBit Driver Booster 5.6.1 to my computer and ran the search. Found many drivers out of date. After running this program I was able to update drivers and I was able to update my computer from 1709 to 1803.

            If your computer has a storage LED, is it animating?
<br />
<br />If you are connected to the Internet, wired or wireless, try disconnecting from it to see if it progresses.
<br />
<br />Give two more hours to see if it progresses.
<br />
<br />If it does not, power down, wait 10 minutes, then start it again.

<h2>            Lost power during Windows 10 reset</h2>
                    <p>So after a few problems with Windows 10 (problems connecting to external devices etc.) I decided to do a factory reset. I followed the instructions and chose to have it clear out my files and settings as well. After hitting accept I then went to have some
 lunch. When I returned to my pc after around 15 min I found it completely switched of. The mouse, keyboard were dark and the computer was completely off. Now when I switch on the pc it starts like normal but nothing is displayed on the screens, except "HDMI
 no signal". Then afterwards while it powers of, but leaving mouse and keyboard with power(LEDs glowing, pc dark)</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

</p><p><span>Device drivers simplify programming by acting as translator between a hardware device and the applications or</span>
<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/os.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Operating Systems
</strong></a><span>that use it</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To update a driver you cannot simply go into </span><strong><a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000833.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong><span> and click "update driver" because the list it checks may not be
 current and may not include the tweaks that computer makers add to make generic drivers specific to their hardware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Always download the fresh copy FIRST</strong>. Then remove the current copy and install the fresh copy</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>When a device is not working you need to find the driver for that device</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways to find the update.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First is to go to the computer makers site and downloading their driver (Dell, HP, Asus,etc)</span>
</p>
<p><span>Second is to go to the device makers site. For video nVidia, or ATI, for networking Intel, etc)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example if you need to update your video driver for an nVidia video card and have an HP computer you could go to HP, or nVidia.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>HP would have the most compatible, while nVidia would have the most current, so it is a trade off between compatibility and newest features.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Computer makers will often stop developing drivers for new operating systems but the video card maker usually will not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Sometimes you will need to completely re-install the software package to replace the driver.&nbsp; This occurs in things like malware applications, third party apps, etc</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><strong><span>Searching for the driver.</span></strong><span>If you know the name of the driver the first step is to Google it.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>You will get hundreds (or more) results but there will only be a few that are relevant to your computer.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Don't use driver inspector, driver sweeper, etc type programs, but rather the computer maker or device makers site</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can also go here for links to the relevant sites&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></span><a href="http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.php</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you do not know the driver name go into Device Manager and find the device that is not working.</span></p>
<p><span>Right click it &gt; properties &gt; details &gt; use the pull down to find hardware ID'S.
</span></p>
<p><span>Copy the short string and paste it into Google</span>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you have found (and downloaded) the driver, remove the current driver (again in Device Manager) by again right clicking, then clicking uninstall.&nbsp;
<strong>You must un-install it completely even if the fresh driver is the same date</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Install the fresh copy by double clicking the downloaded driver and following the instructions.</p>
