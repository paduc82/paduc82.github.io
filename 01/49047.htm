<h3> j-otis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 fails when upgrading from a Phenom II X2 to an X4</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 64-bit on a Biostar TA790GX A3+ AM3 motherboard. I've been running an Phenom II X2 555 processor and would like to switch to an X4 965 processor but I can't get Windows 7 to boot when I swap the processors. Both processors are supported
 by the motherboard and both processors work fine when they are running the AMI bios routines or the memory check program but the motherboard reboots when loading Windows 7, usually right after I enter my username and hit enter.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'm replacing is the CPU. I've tried resetting the bios ROMs using the reset Jumpers, I've set the bios to the OPTIMUM setting, and I've fiddled with most of the bios settings trying to get Windows 7 to go past the login screen.<br />
<br />
Is this a security feature to prevent me from moving my OEM system builder copy of Windows from one machine to another? Is there a work around? Do I need to call Microsoft? Is there a phone number?<br />

            Okay, After fiddling with a number of commands that were listed on this website as possible solutions for getting a Windows 7 system to boot up again I finally gave in and decided to do a fresh install.
<br />
<br />
My machine had been running for two years with Windows XP and it had worked for 6 months with Windows 7 32bit. It worked for 2 months after I upgraded to Windows 7 64bit. Then I swapped out the AMD X2 955 processor for an AMD X4 965 processor.
<br />
<br />
I ran SFC, SCANNOW, and BOOTREC and I reverted my system to the last known good configuration but I could not get my machine to stop crashing 7 seconds (sometime 14 seconds) after the Windows login screen appeared. After wasting a couple of days watching Windows
 7 boot and crash in an endless loop I decided to buy a new hard drive and do a fresh install. One of the best solutions was to use the command line MSCONFIG program in Win7 to tell Windows to run my upgrade X4 CPU as an X2 or X3 processor. This seemed to solve
 all the problems with Win 7 crashing.<br />
<br />
I had a copy of WinXP for this machine on a hard drive. When I plugged in the SATA cables and tried to boot WinXP with the X4 CPU it booted right up and ran for two days. So, it wasn't the CPU.<br />
<br />
After a good amount of wasted time,&nbsp; I could not longer get my win7 64bit system to boot so I bought a new hard drive and installed Windows 7 64 bit from scratch. This setup had no problem for a couple of days until Windows 7 started downloading UPDATES. It
 downloaded and installed 93 updates all at once and rebooted fine. A while later it downloaded 4 more updates. I shut the machine down and started it up again and it went into it's updating files routine. It said it was applying 1 of 4 updates. On the second
 or third update it got to 32% and shutdown. It did this three or four times, each time it came up with the F8 boot screen that gives you the option to boot with minimal windows. I choose the one with networking. As it booted into that envioronment it said
 that the updates had failed and it was going to REVERT. IT shut down 3 or 4 times saying it was reverting files. FInally it booted and gave me a login screen. I logged in and did a few things then I closed down my computer to see if it would boot. It repeated
 the four updating Windows files reboots, then I went into the minimal Windows with Networking, it gave me the reverting screen again, and then it went thru the four reverting reboots.<br />
<br />
I decided to document this process here in the ANSWERS forum.<br />
<br />
Now when I pass my cursor over the START &gt; SHUTDOWN button it shows that Windows 7 wants to "Install Updates and then shutdown" just like it did the last two times. Each round of shutdowns takes about a half an hour to go thru it's four cycles of updates and
 four cycles of reverts.<br />
<br />
Now I'm looking for a way to prevent Windows 7 from trying to apply the same 4 updates that have already failed twice.<br />
<br />
I haven't mentioned it so far but the 100MB on my hard disk that is called SYSTEM RESERVE is also a problem as is the PROTECTION on my files. I have a directory on the E: drive called PICTURES. It had thousands of photographs that were put on there under Windows
 7 over the past few years. Now that I can no longer get that Windows 7 build to boot all those files have a SECURITY LOCK on them. It's no problem because a new Windows 7 install will allow me to break the lock as long as I'm the administrator. The problem
 is that I have to break the lock on every directory. Each time it requires a dozen clicks. I'm glad Windows 7 allows me to Break the locks but what good is a lock if it can be broken so easily?<br />
<br />
Now, I need to know how to CANCEL those 4 pending file upgrades that will happen automatically when I shut down.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Weak Wifi connection &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I have had this problem for the about 2 month now. My laptop is located on the desk in my room and I had no problem connecting to my wifi and keeping a steady connection before these two months. I'm not sure why but I think it was after an update my connection
 to the wifi went downhill and i couldn't keep a steady wifi connection in the same exact location. I tried moving my laptop next to my wifi source and this seems to fix the problem. But it is very inconvenient using my laptop just next to the wifi source.

<p>
</p><p>See if this works for you. Be sure you are in the <strong>Sent</strong> folder. In the
<strong>Home</strong> menu click <strong>Find</strong>, then <strong>Message</strong>. In the
<strong>To:</strong> field of the form that pops up, type the email address of the person. Click
<strong>Find Now</strong>, and a list of the messages you have sent to that person will be displayed. You can sort that list by clicking any of the column headings. Use
<strong>Date</strong>.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand you correctly, all you need to do is left-click the down-arrow, next to the&nbsp; 'Sent' heading, that sits above the date column. Clicking again reverses the order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW - If you update to <em>Windows Live 2012</em>, the problem with deleting has been fixed. It is a free download from Microsoft, &nbsp;just Google '<em>Windows Live 2012 download'
</em>to find the correct page.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize I can reverse the order but this isn't the issue. The list of dates&nbsp;in the "sent" column for anyone I've sent an email to are not chronological. E.G. the list of emails sent to say Bryan Greene ( myself) i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, &nbsp;which I can
 see having clicked "to" and scrolling down to the b's, are not in date order, the first might be 1/02/2016 the next might be 15/02/2016, the third 04/01/2016, then 20/02/2016, then 03/08/2014. The date sent is listed randomly it would appear. Reversing the
 date order just provides a reversed equally random list of dates sent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone has suggested putting the email address into "search" in&nbsp;sent mail and this does provide a chronological list which is a step in the right direction. However the list also includes other emails that include4 that address where it has been referred
 to in the text e.g. and email to another addressee with a copy of an email to the person I am searching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I already have version 2012 of Live Mail as I installed it in late 2012 but perhaps&nbsp; it's not. How can I tell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. Much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. This does indeed provide a chronological list which is a big step in the right direction. However the list also includes other emails that include the same email&nbsp;address where it has been referred to in the text e.g. an email to another
 addressee with a copy of an email to the person I am searching. So I don't just get a list of the emails I have sent to an addressee but a list of all the emails that include that address. This is better than before&nbsp;but it still takes some sifting through
 especially with people I have emailed a lot and whose address I have sent to others as a link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to why my sent emails aren't automatically stored in chronological order and how I can amend this? I guess there must be some criteria for the order they are stored in. Perhaps alphabetically based on the first letter of each email or something
 else equally obscure. If so then I just need to find a way of changing this setting to a "date sent" basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bryan.</p>

<p>It may appear so, but I'm sure it's not. I think you'll find that a message list sorted by&nbsp;<em>To</em> will show messages in order of
<em>Subject</em>, remembering that subject prefixes like <em>Re</em>: and <em>Fw</em>: will be ignored for sorting purposes. The listing for messages with the same subject will in my experience be ordered by date, something like this:</p>

<h3> austinbennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Motorsport 4 double-disc edition</h2>
                    I picked up Forza motorsport 4 from gamestop a while back and I ended up with the second disc 'special edition' well I go to the menu on the first disc and try to tell it to install the second disc and I can't find the option to do so. In the menu I only
 have 5 options, career, community, auto vista, hot lap, and marketplace. Normally there is another option that states "Install disc 2" and has a picture of a Ferrari Enzo with a racing strip on it and I don't see that. I was just wondering if I could get some
 help on getting this 6th option if you don believe me I can take a picture of the disc and the game side-by-side.

<p>It's worth noting that the buttons DO work in Skype for Business (previously Lync), but not the regular version of Skype.</p>

<h2>            RAM Compatibilty on Asus M5A78L-M&#47;USB3 Motherboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if anyone can help tell me if this ram:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-CT25664BA1339-240-PIN-PC3-10600-Memory/dp/B001NA25VS/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crucial CT25664BA1339 2GB 240-PIN PC3-10600 DIMM DDR3 Memory Module</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is compatible with this motherboard:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A78LMUSB3/HelpDesk_QVL/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Asus M5A78L-M/USB3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have 3 sticks of this ram:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4c883a1-47eb-4b56-9e70-d5d02aae79b5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I want to add one more stick of the Crucial RAM I listed above.&nbsp; The problem is that my motherboard website doesn't list any 2 Gigabyte RAM sticks as compatible if you check the most recent list!&nbsp; That doesn't make any sense because I am already using
 3 sticks that are 2 GB each!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Hello BTKu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to read about all the trouble you're experiencing, it shouldn't be this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can request a refund right from your Skype profile. You will see the option if you're elegible.
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA297/can-i-get-a-refund-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Please see more info in this FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that page you can also try to contact with an agent again, please do try and contact us back if you couldn't do it. Thank you.</p>

Select your product dropdown &lt;Skype&gt;<br />
Select your issue drop down &lt;calling and messaging&gt;<br />

Ask the community</p>

<p>In that case, maybe the problem is in the other side. You can tap on your avatar inside Skype and select "Audio&amp;Video". From there, scrolling down you will find an option to "Make a free test call". That way you will be able to check if your setup is working.
 If you can hear the voice and also your own recording, is probable that your good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your side is working, your partners in the call may be the ones having a problem. You can ask them to make a test call to find out how are thing in their side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the help pages there is also a <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA12097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
step by step guide</a> to check what could be wrong when you cannot hear someone in the call. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the quality of the WiFi and if possible, use a wired connection.</li><li>Check the microphone, speakers or headphones.</li><li>Check the camera.</li><li>Make a free test call.</li></ul>
<p>Also you can try asking someone else in the call to actually initiate (host) the call to see if it makes a difference.</p>

<p><span>Test calling is fine - <strong>it's conference calling that is not working.</strong></span><br />

            ﻿If the key is on the computer case then Windows was preinstalled, and the OEM computer manufacturer is responsible for replacing your product key.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
How To Obtain A Replacement Product Key<br />
If you have a lost or unreadable product key for Microsoft software that came with your computer, please contact the manufacturer of your computer to obtain a replacement. Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, what is asking for a key? The key on your computer case will not activate Office.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case to activate Office? That will not work - only an Office key will activate Office.
<br />
<br />
Some new computers come with Microsoft Office Starter, which is a free version of Office with reduced functions. If you want to add more features you can buy the full version of Office. If you did buy Office you should have a key that was included with it.<br />
<br />
Also, some new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license.
<br />

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />

            Hi LEONYU1, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            It is showing memory corruption. Let's first see whether it is caused by a driver or not.
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully.

<h2>            Internet Disconnects after 5 minutes</h2>
                    Hi I have been using my PC for a long time. I went away for the weekend and when I came back I recieved a problem.&nbsp; Every 5 minutes or so the internet stops working.&nbsp; There is no notification that a cable has been disconnected.&nbsp; When I type something into
 the address bar it keeps loading but the page never comes up.&nbsp; It's not my hardware or ISP because I booted another operating system (fedora) and it worked fine. A temporary fix I use is to unplug and replug the eithernet cable.&nbsp; But then the problem occurs
 again in 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried:<br />
1. disable internet card<br />
2. set a static ip<br />
3. ip/release ip/renew<br />
4. uninstall internet card<br />
5. restart router
                </div>

<p>Hi AppleWilliam, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. The first thing we need to do is identify where the issue actually is. This could be an issue with a piece of hardware, Internet Explorer, Windows, or your ISP.
<br />
<br />
First when the issue happens again do the following. <br />
<br />
Type the following command:</p>
<p><strong>IPCONFIG /ALL</strong> [Note that there is no space between the slash and ALL.]</p>
<p><strong>Right click in the command window</strong> and choose<strong> Select All</strong>, then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
Paste the results in a message here.<br />
<br />
In the same command prompt window identify the DNS and&nbsp;Gateway (it will look something like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1</strong> and
<strong>DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . :&nbsp;192.168.100.54</strong>&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Now in the black comand prompt type the following command:<br />
<br />
<strong>PING 192.168.1.1</strong> (replacing your gateway&nbsp;IP here)&nbsp;[Note that there is no space between the slash and ALL]
<br />
Let us know if you get reply or timeouts. <br />
<br />
Also again in the same window type the following command <br />
<br />
<strong>PING 192.168.100.54</strong> (replacing your DNS IP here)&nbsp;[Note that there is no space between the slash and ALL]
<br />
Let us know if you get reply or timeouts.<br />
<br />
If both reply then you may have an issue with your web browser. If you use and other Web Browsers test with those and see if you have the same result.
<br />
<br />
If you do not get a reply, test with another computer if possible to see if the issue persists there. If the issue does not occur on the other PC, then Check your network cable connecting to the PC and see if there is a link light. If there is a link light
 then try to replace the cable and see if the issue persists.&nbsp; If the issue persists after replacing cable with a known good working one. If the issue still occurs with a known good working cable then try a different port on the router or switch.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Please let us know if any of these steps did or did not resolve your issue.
<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows Home 7 Premium reload activation problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john hermanson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Home 7 Premium reload activation problem</h2>
                    <p>First off, I build my own machines so I don't have a manufacture.&nbsp; The mobo is a gigabyte.&nbsp; I reload windows 7 often.&nbsp; I have lots of older versions of windows, with activation codes, etc, so I use the win 7 upgrade.&nbsp; I have skipped the posting of the product
 key until later so that I can do a clean install.&nbsp; This has worked fine every time I have installed... until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 and had many problems with it, so I tried reloading a ghosted copy of win 7.&nbsp; The copy failed.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling win 7 and after installing, adding sp1.&nbsp; I then tried to register it with the product key.&nbsp; Unlike any other time,
 windows returned an error that this version cannot be loaded as a clean install, but must be an upgrade.&nbsp; I tried other keys, and found that I was blocked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have built my machines when all there was was Dos.&nbsp; I have lots of legitimate older copies of windows.&nbsp; Do I have to reinstall one of these ancient copies before installing win 7 now?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my product key unblocked?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>The "ghost" program is not a Norton product&nbsp; It's a freebee that I tried.&nbsp; Regardless, as it didn't work I did another fresh install of win 7... that's when I received the message that I can not use the upgrade version for a fresh install, and the product
 key for that win 7 was blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is temporarily solved.&nbsp; I had a second version of win 7 upgrade and I installed that... and the key for that one worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, on the other win 7 (I have purchased two win 7 upgrade install programs; right now, I only use one of them) the product key is still locked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question now is, how to get it unlocked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh... and thank you for the reply!</p>

            Hello <span><span>PamRa<br />
<br />
You will need an XP installation CD to fix thus, so can you borrow one?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Then<br />
<span>
<p><span>Configure your PC to boot from CD if it isn't already set up that way. (You may need to enter the BIOS to configure the PC to boot from the CD.)</span></p>
<p><span>Start your PC with the XP Setup CD in the drive. When you see the "Press any key to boot from CD..." prompt, do so and let the CD-based boot process begin.</span></p>
<p><span>When the Recovery Console option is offered ("Press R to start the Recovery Console"), do so. You may be asked which Windows installation to enter, in which case
 type the number of the Windows installation you wish to work on (usually "1").</span></p>
<p><span>When prompted, enter the Administrator's password for that Windows installation. If you did not set a password just press ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>At the command prompt, type
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>chkdsk /r</strong>&nbsp; (there is a space before /)<br />
Enter</span></p>
<p><br />
.</p>

<p>0x000000ED error normally relates to a faulty or failing hard disk :-/</p>
<p>Best bet is to take your system in to a computer repair shop and get them to clone your hard disk to a new one, chances are that will fix it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Please vote if it does :)</p>

                    <p>after upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1 pro on lenovo x1 carbon touch screen, the new start menu has NO store apps on it and the taskbar properties doesn't have any way to turn on the start screen, either. &nbsp;how do i get my store and purchased apps back?</p>

            <p>solved. &nbsp;called tech support and he ran scf /scannow and another program to check the integrity of the usb install media. &nbsp;neither actually reported errors, however after a reboot, the windows apps slowly started re-appearing in the new start menu! &nbsp;I had
 to add them manually into the start screen tile area, though, so I essentially lost my old start screen as part of the upgrade. &nbsp;None of the desktop apps were affected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like nothing else is wrong, other than the insane choice to force automatic upgrades to drivers, another subject entirely. &nbsp;Kind of reminds me of windows 8.0, that.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> </span>
I suggest you to install all the latest pending Windows updates as below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to “settings” and click on “update and security”.</li><li>Under tab “Windows update”, click on the icon “check for updates”.</li><li>Then once you find the pending updates install it and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows logo key + X</span></strong>,&nbsp;select
<strong><span>Command&nbsp;Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Run the "<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt (Admin) and hit
<strong><span>Enter </span></strong>key.</span></li><li><span>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Run the DISM tool
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows Update corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows logo key + X</span></strong>, select
<strong><span>Command Prompt(Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image&nbsp;/Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin)&nbsp;and hit
<strong><span>Enter </span></strong>key</span></li><li><span>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required
 to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source
 of the files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, run the following command instead:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>To learn more about this tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

            Hi Sverre,
<br />
<br />Have you already installed Windows onto that drive and it is MBR rather than GPT?
<br />
<br />If so, go into BIOS and make these changes (if available)
<br />
<br />Disable Secure Boot 
<br />Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />Enable CSM 
<br />Move the SSD to the top of the boot order 
<br />
<br />Save those settings and restart your PC

            Installed a basic Win 10 pro 64 version on an empty drive. Checking the SSD it has neither recovery nor EFI partitions, just the partition the OS is installed on. I’m guessing this is some sort of insane setup where additional OS’s rely on the “main” installation
 to boot? Is there any way around this?

            Reinstalled Windows onto the SSD to see what happends to the drive. It does NOT have an EFI partition, so I guess Windows feels that I should keep the “old” OS on the HDD? Because if I format the HDD I guess I’m up **** creek again? I know I could just
 delete the old HDD before I reinstall on the SSD, but I want to know what happends here, in case I make the same mistake again. Is there no way I can get the BIOS/Windows to understand that I want to use the SSD and delete the OS on the HDD?

</p><p>With the recent action you've taken with your old hard drive, it is possible that the EFI file associated with it was deleted. Therefore, to boot your system normally, I suggest performing a clean install. You can visit this forum&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">article</a></strong>
 posted by Andre Da Costa to know more details on how you can perform it.<br />

            Most likely cause is a faulty display driver. Please provide me following information -
<br />1. What is your computer's make and model number?
<br />
<br />2. Open Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapters &gt; Post the screenshot here
