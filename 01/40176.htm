<h2>            Do you feel bad leaving Xbox for PlayStation&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, the games being on PlayStation so there really isn't much choice and Sony has shown to be the better of the three console game makers and having games for it, so I don't feel like that, no.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I am excited to see how the PlayStation 4 console box looks like. I'll still check out E3 Xbox for Xbox 360 and One (just out of curiosity), but as for Next-Gen it's PS4.</p>

<p>No, because im not actually switching anything. Im a gamer and not a fanboy. I own 3 PS3s, and 3 XBox 360s. &nbsp;Even though I prefer my 360, I still love playing my PS3. As for the XBox Done, I refuse to buy their pile of crap. It might have the best games
 in the world, but that doesn't matter because the hardware flat out sucks. Microsoft refused to listen to what gamers wanted, now its more then likely too late to fix the issue unless they want to delay it for maybe another year. I doubt they'll do that. Anyway,
 they know their screwed and this is why their in damage control mode and their attempts to convince people to buy the XBox Done have been pathetic at best. Between them trying to pay off publishers not to show PS4 versions at E3, to the whole Reddit thing,
 its really a bad joke. About all they can do now is wait for E3 and hope that people will be so wowed by the games that they'll forget about the whole used game issue, or the tiny hard drive, or the mandatory internet, or the always on Kinect. Yeah im aware
 they said the Kinect can be turned off, but at the same time it needs to be plugged in. &nbsp;The XBox brand is dead. Yes im sad that I won't be playing the next Halo, or the next Forza, or the next Gears, but oh well. There will be way more PS4, and Wii U exclusive
 for me to enjoy just as much. If anyone buys an XBox Done, they are doing nothing more but sending a message to MS that they will gladly accept draconian DRM and it will only get more and more restrictive. Just look what it did to the PC market. publishers
 were plagued by piracy so they kept putting more and more restrictions in their games. The end result was the pirate still hacking all the games and playing them for free and without the DRM. In the meantime the paying customer got the shaft. Just compare
 the PC game sections in stores today compared to 10 years ago. Back then it was huge, but today its a fraction of the size and filled mainly with a few big name titles and a few budget titles.

<p>No, you would never get a call from either Microsoft or from any reputable partner based on error codes.&nbsp; This is what's called a "cold call" - they call people at random and take a chance that they have a computer and that it has given them some problem
 in a while.&nbsp; If they can fool you, then they start telling you to type certain commands into your computer that "prove" there's a problem but really those commands show the same thing every time, whether or not there is really a problem.&nbsp; They then try to
 talk you into providing them remote access to your computer, and once the hook is set they demand money for their "services" - and while connected to your computer they could have installed anything, viruses, backdoor software to allow them back in later,
 anything they wanted.</p>
<p>You did very well to be suspicious and to shut them down without following any of their advice or allowing them into your computer.</p>

            Hi Tommy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>

<h2>            Any way to force Surface 2 to install Firmware update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Due to touchscreen issues, I have reset my device to factory 3 times over the last week. No matter what I do, the Firmware update 2015-11-09 fails.&nbsp; It downloads, 'installs' and restarts the tablet, only to go to 'pending restart' and after two restart,
 it changes to "Failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing all the updates in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried 'hiding' the firmware update and waiting until all the (hundreds) of other updates were successfully installed, then tried only the firmware update. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried hiding all the other updates and installing only the firmware update. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as of a few minutes ago, after another complete reset, 3 day battery drain, recharge... every update has successfully installed except the firmware, and still no touchscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA: If you're only going to respond to tell me to take it to a store and/or pay for support, please don't.

            <p>After following some steps found elsewhere (for RT and the endless spinning update search) which resulted in updates that had never come down before, the Firmware update finally installed (last night). To my endless frustration, it did not fix the original
 reason for trying --- the touchscreen still doesn't work. I still get the yellow (!!) on the device manager/touchscreen firmware that says restart is required (Code 14), no matter how many times I restart it -- approximately a million times thus far.
<br />
</p>
<p>ETA: As I said in my original post, I have already reset my tablet several times over since the touchscreen fail a week ago, both with my own recovery USB and the image found on your link, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is REALLY strange is, after the last reset to factory (not refresh, not even 'save some settings' - a full on format - it reverted of course to the original MS desktop and colours. This morning, after another battery drain/recharge, the personal photo
 I had as my desktop wallpaper appeared. WTAF? </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is my touchscreen and MS Wedge Bluetooth mouse (which it also won't discover, again) to work. I honestly can't believe there isn't a solution.

</p><p>I think that may be a mistake, e.g. once the firmware has been updated I doubt it can be "reset", so what you may be seeing is WU being confused about what it has done after you have reset the OS.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes --- if you see my other reply above, I did find that post yesterday and went through all those steps. Late last night the firmware update did finally install successfully (awesome), along with a few hundred other updates, however, sadly, it did not fix
 my original issue, which was the touchscreen not working. Even though the firmware installed, I still have the yellow !!! exclamation on the Touchscreen Firmware (in Device Manager) and the 'pending restart (Code 14) message, no matter how many times I restart.

<p>You do not send your power supply. You only send the console itself for repair, unless they have informed you differently. This is what they send you after you have arranged for a repair.

<p>Hi, if you are trying to print out a label for a repair you can do that by either visiting the repair website located
<strong><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. When a repair is successfully finished you get an e-mail with a prepaid shipping label already good to go that you just need to slap on your console for repair. If you did not get this e-mail then
 you will need to contact phone support for them to re-send it to you.<br />
<br />
If you've already sent your console in then your good to go. It's asked that you do not send any sort of other things with the console unless otherwise stated. This includes, the consoles hard drive (if the issue was not with the hard drive), the power supply
 (unless the issue was with the power supply as well and you were also told to send this in), and any sort of cables.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the link that dd posted with the correct packaging instructions.</p>

<p>Hi Lukasz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that is possible granted you are able to set both of them up correctly, then there shouldn't be a problem. The only thing that it depends on is how you play and where you buy your games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you use Steam to buy and play or the Microsoft Store and Xbox app to play?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Steam, just&nbsp;follow the instructions on their support site, but through the Xbox app it may only work for certain games using the two at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I'll provide a couple of support articles on setting up the controllers to a Windows PC:</p>
<ul>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately Microsoft Office doesn‚Äôt come with Windows 10 and you need to purchase it in order to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have recently released some free apps with limited functionality hence you can use them if you want to use the free Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the link below:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>

            Me too - just had a batch of 20 on booting, yesterday it was 9. Never seen this before the anniversary update. Home edition on Surface 3, Cortana enabled (but not on lock screen). Not yet tried clean boot etc. Desktop search (via Cortana) still seems to
 be working, but not checked whether indexing new items.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried safe mode and the error did not appear, I haven't tried the clean boot yet (see below for the reason).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error seems to be random so it is difficult to say if it really was gone in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found something that might be a clue though. I was looking through the list of locations that are indexed and I tried removing "Microsoft Outlook" from the list (it is from an Office 365 installation).&nbsp;Then I rebuilt the indexes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have not had the error for a whole day. As the error is a bit random then it is hard to say if this has fixed it. I will continue to monitor and let you know. If it doesn't fix it then I will try the clean boot idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the longest I have been without an error though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course this then moves on to, if this does solve it, what has gone wrong with Outlook search in the Windows Anniversary Update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guy</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it lasted for over a day but when I turned my PC on today I had 3 Search errors (Event 3104) in the log, so it is not Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Clean Boot process and I still get errors even after doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am not sure what to try now. The search process seems to be working, new items are being indexed it is just a trickle of these errors appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are they anything to be concerned about or can they safely be ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried running CHKDISK which found no problems and SFC /SCANNOW which also found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guy</p>

            <p>Hi Srimadhwa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. I went through the clean boot steps and identified two services that may have caused the event 3104 report:</p>
<ol>
<li>mmsminisrv</li><li>AcrSch2Svc</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>These are Acronis True Image services that will start when booting into Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Possible solution in my case</strong></p>
<p>I changed the two service startup types to "Delayed". For now, there is no more Event 3104 error in the Event Log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>I have the same error occurring every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was a clean build with the Anniversary Edition and the issue still occurs with a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Microsoft - as this issue is easily found on the internet and there appears to be no known solution - can you please provide a solution or a statement of what causes this error and how to avoid it.&nbsp; For me it appears several times during the session, particularly
 after start up with an SSD!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>@Microsoft - as there are numerous errors in the Event Logs, can you please explain why these were not identified and resolved by your QA process, or do they follow the supports standard response to "ignore these errors as they are normal".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note I have also run chkdsk and sfc and there are no issues.</p>

    <title>Problem with Dual-Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Dual-Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;My laptop had Windows 8.1 SL x64. I wanted to have Ubuntu as 2nd OS [Dual-Boot]. So, I tried to install it. But, as a matter of fact, I had made a mistake during the installation at the Partitioning of the Ubuntu, as&nbsp; it ended up in removing the Windows
 permanently. I understood that the hard disk was empty without Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this time I installed Windows 8.1 Pro x6, the one on which my laptop is running at present. I don't know if I made any mistake, but, when I try to install Ubuntu again, I am not able to see the partitions. It shows like sort of a new hard disk labeling
 500.1GB. [I could see the partitions when I tried to install it on Windows 8.1 SL x64]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The partitions on my Windows 8.1 Pro are</p>
<p>C: 65.4GB</p>
<p>D: DVD RW Drive</p>
<p>E: 370GB</p>
<p>and another 30GB unallocated drive in which I wanted to install Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see at least one partition from the above list during the Ubuntu installation process. The partitions list during the Ubuntu installation is like "free space 500070MB".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I not able to see the partitions?</p>
<p>Did I made a mistake when I installed Windows 8.1 Pro x64?</p>
<p>Are there any errors with hard disk?</p>
<p>How to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Sony Vaio SVE15133CNB. The official page of this laptop's model is <a href="http://www.sony.co.in/product/sve15133cn/sku/sve15133cnb+in5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Although, the picture is not mine, but, what I meant earlier can be exactly seen in that image to have a better understanding. [I used that picture because I could not take a screen shot during the installation. Thanks to the resource.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>At what point in the installation of Ubuntu does this happen?</strong></p>
<p>The picture to which I gave a link is the part of the installation, where I cannot move further with my installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Have you created unallocated space for the Ubuntu install in Windows Disk Management first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I did. It's 30GB as I mentioned earlier. Also, you can see the following screen shot.</p>

            <p>OK.</p>
<p>Are you trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04?</p>
<p>When you click on Install Now do you see this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the latter then it's a bug in the Ubuntu 13.10/14.04 installer. (See <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1249564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for more info).</p>
<p>You have to click on "Something else" when the partitioner should show you all your partitions.</p>
<p>Then create your /, Home and Swap partitions in the unallocated space and install on the / partition.</p>
<p>The only other thing you need to ascertain is where the Windows EFI is located and install the Grub Boot loader on the same partition.</p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b501500-4ec8-4dc8-a377-e89837b4118f" height="356" width="454" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>or do you see this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6428aa01-2edc-44ed-b26e-333146cad234" height="272" width="456" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the latter then it's a bug in the Ubuntu 13.10/14.04 installer. (See <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1249564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for more info).</p>
<p>You have to click on "Something else" when the partitioner should show you all your partitions.</p>
<p>Then create your /, Home and Swap partitions in the unallocated space and install on the / partition.</p>
<p>The only other thing you need to ascertain is where the Windows EFI is located and install the Grub Boot loader on the same partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but I can't get you. But, the first image which you posted seems to be really helpful. How can I get an option like that? Which version of Ubuntu should I install to get an option in that way?</p>

<p>bonjour je suis un joueur depuis environ 3 ans,j'ai 23 ans et j'√©tudie en graphisme je me voie couper de mes services pour une bio selont xbox qui ne convient pas a la politique .(Je comprend que nous devont rester corecte avec les religion , √®tnie , oriantation
 sexuel name it.)</p>
<p>Mon probl√®me est le suivant : j'ai √©crit un truc comme "je t'est dans ma mire fils de pute" et se matin en voulant profiter de ma journ√© off j'ai ouvert ma console pour me faire un petit Battle Field 3 et boom votre acount est d√©sactiver pour une journ√©e.
 Je trouve super que Microsoft √©saille de garder une ordre dans tous ce kaos que l'ont trouve sur le web.Mais bon a moins que quel que part dans le monde un homme s'appelle fils de pute je n'est offencer personne.Je croie qu'ils y a des lacune pour ce syst√®me
 de contr√¥le. J'ai l'impression que si ont gagne trop de parti ou si on est bon "sans vouloir me venter hi hi" nous avons droit a un paquet de plainte comme mauvais joueur je me souvient plus trop des terme exacte mais je croie que vous comprenez bref ils devrai
 oui il y avoir des plainte mais sa devrait √™tre lu ou je sait pas trop les gens devrait √©crire le pourquoi de la dite plainte. D√©ja la les gens penserais leur nombre de plainte en ratio avec les d√©faites.Je trouve dommage que je paye pour ce service qui laisse
 a d√©sirer alors quand penser vous je suis peut √™tre dans l'erreur et je ne le sait pas?</p>
<p>bref voici mon gamer tag :crataus</p>

<p>Personnellement, je suis un peu tann√© de l'esp√®ce d'attitude de "je paye donc j'ai le droit de faire ce que je veux"... Vraiment, au diable le civisme l√†! Cette esp√®ce de mentalit√© n√©andertalienne qui donne l'impression que tout nous est du, vu que l'on
 paye....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C'est pas parce que t'ach√®te un burger au resto que √ßa te donne le droit d'engueuler la serveurse... ou de la traiter de tous les noms. Comme c'est pas parce que t'ach√®te un abonnement XBOX Live que √ßa te donne le droit d'√™tre impoli avec tout le monde.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'avoue qu'il y a peut-√™tre exag√©ration de la part de Microsoft dans certains cas, mais je pense que n'importe quelle personne qui a une t√™te sur les √©paules peut comprendre qu'un moment donn√©, tu peux pas TOUT surveiller, heille, on parle de 35 MILLIONS
 de membres l√†... Si Microsoft payais du monde pour surveiller tout ce qui passe sur le Live, notre abonnement co√ªterais pas 60$ par ann√©e, mais bien 300$ pour couvrir les salaires des employ√©s. Microsoft pr√©f√®re automatiser certains trucs, et avec raison.
 Quitte √† ce que des fois, √ßa soit plus ou moins justifi√©.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il faut penser que pour la plupart des gens, les bios et contenu de profil xbox live peuvent √™tre consult√©s par pas mal n'importe qui, et Microsoft doit, si elle veut pas avoir de probl√®mes, g√©rer ce contenu pour qu'il soit "safe" et "correct" pour tout
 le monde, ce qui exclu donc le langage vulgaire, quel qu'il soit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penser que votre profil, votre bio, c'est un peu comme une carte d'affaire ou un CV qui vous repr√©sente. Est-ce que c'est comme √ßa qu'on veut se pr√©senter au monde? M√™me si on trouve √ßa "cool" dans un contexte de jeux vid√©o, faut penser que pas juste vos
 amis peuvent lire √ßa. C'est comme Facebook. Pensez que vos parents, vos fr√®res, vos soeurs, ou m√™me √† la limite votre employeur, peut lire √ßa sur vous. Personnellement, je trouverais √ßa bizarre de recevoir une carte d'affaire d'un client ou d'un employeur,
 avec une certaine vulgarit√©.&nbsp;√áa fait pas tr√®s "pro"....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mais c'est mon opinion... ;)</p>

<p>Il ne faut pas oublier que c'est un jeu, donc source de divertissement et de d√©foulement pour certain, chacun a ca version et ca d√©finition du mot plaisir et m√™me si les propos s√©rieux de RealNoise font du sens, notre monde de gamer nous permet de s'√©vader
 du monde r√©el, de fuir ne serait-ce que pour quelques heures la r√©alit√© ext√©rieur mais je peu comprendre qu'une entreprise garde un ≈ìil sur le contenu, je ferait pareil mais je pense qu'il ne faut pas porter de jugement sur les gamer qui ce permette de faire
 ou d'√©crire quelques niaiseries.</p>

<p>Je suis aussi d'accord avec toi, LordViper66, √ßa reste quand m√™me une source de divertissement, mais mon point, rejoint un peu le fait que c'est pas parce qu'on paye que √ßa nous donne le droit d'agir comme si tout nous √©tait d√ª quand m√™me. Je pense qu'il
 faut pas capoter avec √ßa, et pas commencer √† chialer contre Microsoft parce que la compagnie essait de maintenir (aussi bien que mal) un minimum d'ordre et de respect dans la communaut√© de gamers sur sa plateforme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On y pense pas tout le temps, mais dans le monde d'aujourd'***, √ßa prend pas grand chose pour faire capoter le monde. Hey, il y a du monde qui appellent les fournisseurs d'acc√®s internet pour ce plaindre du contenu des pages que leurs enfants lisent, pensant
 qu'ils sont responsables de √ßa... alors aujourd'***, si tu veux √©viter les poursuites et le niaisage avec du monde qui comprennent pas mais qui peuvent monter n'importe quoi en scandale √† Fox News aux √âtats-Unis, t'as besoin de "tenir le volant serr√©" pas
 mal pour √©viter le moindre petit d√©rapage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Et √ßa prend juste un seul parent imb√©cile pour se plaindre √† Microsoft que son enfant a regard√© un profil sur XBOX Live o√π il y avait des "mots vulgaires" dedans pour cr√©er un scandale m√©diatique potentiel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alors Microsoft fait du mieux qu'il peut. Et s√©rieusement, en √©crivant des trucs comme ce que celui qui a cr√©√© ce sujet a √©crit, personnellement, je trouve que c'est pas fort. C'est un peu comme courrir apr√®s le trouble pis se plaindre apr√®s que le trouble
 t'a effectivement trouv√©.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On peut aussi avoir du fun sans √™tre oblig√© d'√™tre "vulgaire". Et pour ceux qui le savent pas, "f!ls de p*te", c'est pas une forme de politesse. M√™me si √ßa peut √™tre "comique" dans un certain contexte.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 can&#39;t operate any webcam or webcam software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron_ms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 can&#39;t operate any webcam or webcam software</h2>
                    I've owned a Logitech C525 webcam for almost a year now without any problems, but suddenly since yesterday no program can use the device on my computer. It's installed properly and everything, I made sure by uninstalling and reinstalling the device and
 verifying that I had the most updated drivers downloaded... So I thought maybe the webcam was broken, and bought a new one-- a Logitec 615c, but same exact problem. The device is detected in device manager and according to such it's working properly, but I
 can't get the camera to turn on through any program (including logitec camera software) except during the initial installation where it tests your camera during setup. One thing I've discovered, though, is that the built in mic in both webcams works perfectly
 fine on any program and it's also failing to operate webcam-spoofing software like Manycam as well (which is why I'm assuming it's an issue with windows rather than the Logitech devices). Further, I tested both devices on a family member's laptop and both
 of them work absolutely fine without any issues.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea what this is, and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Edit: So I did some more troubleshooting, and apparently the cameras as well as webcam software works perfectly fine on a different windows profile, and the problems I'm having are just isolated to this one. Would that possibly mean that the profile itself
 is corrupted, or something?

            The method with Windows+R does not work at all. The Run Windows only proposes me to run a "SKYDRIVE.exe" that does not do anything at all. I disabled the password three month ago, and suddenly my computer is locked by this silly password everytime I want
 to turn it on. It drives me crazy. How is it possible to make something like that so difficult????? After three months trying Windows again, I feel I will go&nbsp; back to Ubuntu soon.

            Looks like they have removed the color setting in the latest version Update as part of removing Control Panel settings.

            What is the edition of your PC?
<br />Is Home, Professional, Enterprise etc?
<br />Go to search and type winver. 
<br />If it is Home then there is no local policy.
<br />If it is the others then go to search and type  secpol.msc
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.
