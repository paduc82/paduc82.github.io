</p><p>Windows 10 has removed some of the older (less secure) default storage protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that typically means that you should either:</p>

    <title>How to remove entries of deleted files in the MFT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gobr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove entries of deleted files in the MFT</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following Problem: Last month I tried to recover deleted files on my drive C:.. I have the Notebook since several years and never set up the System new. The undelete program searched a very long time and found the entries of nearly 600.000 deleted
 files from many years, and most of them were overwritten. A lot were deleted by Windows, but there were many other programs like Firefox or Internet Explorer, which deleted many files too. It was nearly impossible, to find anything. After this I tried to clear
 the MFT from the deleted files. But I didn't find any tool to solve this Problem. Checkdisk didn't do it and some other tools like Secure Eraser didn't, too. The only thing that was possible, was to rename some fileentries, so that it was no longer possible,
 to view, which files were deleted. But there were shadowcopies of the drive and I don't want to see any of the deleted files in the recovery window. When Windows deletes files, I wish, that they are away. The next thing is, that I want to defrag the MFT. With
 one million or more fileentries it is a great confusion and I don't believe, that the MFT works well. So, I'm Looking for a free or open source tool that deletes all no longer needet entries in the MFT. If someone knows one, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm writing this, I have another stupid problem. Using the german language version of Edge I have many trouble with the autocorrection of the spelling. It is really annoying. Nearly every word is underlined as wrong and many words were corrected like
 in the german spelling. And there is no option, to stop this. I really don't know. what the engeneers of Microsoft do the&nbsp; whole day. Windows is a very errorful System and many errors exist for years and are never never corrected. I hope, someone of the support-team
 of Microsoft reads this too and tells the engeneers, how stupid Edge is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the request is longer than I wanted, but there were a lot of things to say. It was very dificult, to find this page. I think, Microsoft doesn't want questions about their buggy software. And there is no german page to ask in german, though many computers
 in Germany have Microsoft programs, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answers</p>
<p>
</p><p>GoBr</p>

            Hi GB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is good information about wiping the MFT here:
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/254054/how-to-reset-an-ntfs-mft-for-no-tracks-of-deleted-files-names-to-be-found-there" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/254054/how-to-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Edge is being rebuilt on the Chrome chassis and will be re-released soon: 
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/faq-edge-chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/faq-edge-chromium</a>
<br />
<br />I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then check the System Files: 
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  If you will wait to rate my post until we're finished I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hallo Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your answer. First I looked at the link for the MFT. I downloaded two of the recommended programs: "PriVazer" was very quick, but I think it didn't delete the slackspace. After it had finished I had ~5 GB diskspace more. :-) I don't know why,
 but I like it. My problem wasn't solved. The entries in the MFT were only renamed, but not removed. Then I tried "MooO Anti recovery". It ran several hours, but the result was the same as with PriVazer: The entries in the MFT got other names and are still
 there. When I search with "Undelete 360" now the searchtime is increased to a few seconds (needed ~1 hour before using this programs). To my misbehavior it finds still more than 350.000 deleted files. When I make a deepscan with recuva there are more than
 550.000 entries found (but in avery short time in comparison to my first search). Unfortunately, I think there is only a software suite from "Paragon", which is able to remove the entries. Because I don't know, if it really does, I won't pay any money for
 this suite and the free version doesn't have this function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other ideas, how to solve my problem, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge is a very unuseful browser. In almost 4 years that it exists, I used it one or two hours to try something, that Firefox or Chrome didn't do. But I was never satisfied. Since 10 or more years my only browser was Firefox. In the last time I had many issues
 because it it was frozen, so I installed Chrome too and that is better. I tried to reset Edge in the "Apps and Features" without succes. So I didn't invest more time for this bad software. The spellcheckers autocorrection is in german and there is no possibility
 to change this. Unfortunately Microsoft redirects the supportpage to Edge. I began my search with Chrome, but when I clicked for support, Edge opened and I asked the questions in this annoying piece of software. I guess, it changed 50 times a correct english
 word in the wrong german spelling. Now it is possible, to ask and answer without Edge :-) and that is wonderful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope, you will have more suggestions for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely</p>
<p>
</p><p>GoBr</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>I tried to give you the best rating that was possible. There were only five stars without description and I thought, the right one was for best. I'm sorry, that this wasn't so. In any other site for ratings the right is the best. I don't know, why this here
 is other.</p>

            The reason I asked is because I suspect the ratings system is buggy.  I think it gives a bad rating if you answer the popup that the post didn't help, but we were just getting started.  Oh, well, I was just asking to see.
<br />
<br />Now, as to wiping the drive to get rid of underlying data, partition table (which holds the data together in a file system), and boot code which can interfere if it isn't wiped, the cleanest method is Diskpart Clean and Clean All.  Clean is sufficient just to wipe the partition table and boot sector to get rid of that code since nothing can be retrieved without extremely advanced forensics software,  while Clean All zeros the whole drive so underlying data is wiped clean.  
<br />
<br />These Commands here: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a> can only be used on a full hard drive.  To delete data on a partition or from files that are deleted, use a tool like CCleaner Drive Wiper that can wipe specific areas only:  
<br /><a href="https://support.piriform.com/hc/en-us/articles/204043884-Using-CCleaner-s-Drive-Wiper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.piriform.com/hc/en-us/articles/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps more.  Also, there is a German Language forums here if you want to ask about Edge there.  There are quite a few MVP's and active participants there, too.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to tell you, that all programs I tried not did, what I wanted to do. Now I tried Ccleaner. It has the worst performance of all programs I used and worked two days for a 200 GB partition, but it didn't solve my problem. In the MFT are still more
 than 500.000 entries of deleted files. I'm looking for a possibility to remove these entries. It's no solution to rename them. Every day come many new entries of deleted files in the MFT and the performance gets much much worse. I want that deleted files from
 the system like Windows, Firefox or many other programs are completely deleted without interaction from me. It is a great risk for security, that everyone can read, what's in these deleted files. I don't know, what hackers all can do, but everyone who has
 my PC, can recover deleted files and nowadays everyday my PC may be stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I don't want every week to clean my system drive for hours and my PC is unusable&nbsp; in all that time. So if you have a possibility to interact with Microsoft, please tell them the problem and that they try to find a solution. It's a system fault and a
 problem for Microsoft and not for third party software developers. And I don't want to delete all my data or to format the partition. Because it's the system drive, it would last days to install Windows and all programs new. The installed programs are the
 result of many years working with my PC and are needed. What I don`t like or use is uninstalled immediately. But the uninstall process is badly developed and leaves rubbish data behind. My data files are on another partition and if it is necessary, I wipe
 them while deleting. But Windows and all the programs I have installed, don't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beg you, to search for more solutions for my problem. After searching in the Internet for many hours I don't know more than&nbsp; before. It seems, as if there is no solution with simple programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<h2>            Unable to generate System Health Report, error&#58; Access Denied.</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title: System Health Report shows Access Denied</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to run a System Health Report for first time in a fairly new&nbsp;HP&nbsp;laptop DV7 and got a message saying "Access Denied".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read some comments&nbsp;in this forum relating to downloading a&nbsp;clean Windows 7 , but with limited computer knowledge that is not my preferred alternative. Any recommendations? Thank you, AG</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you encountered this error by clicking a link on a Web page, the link might not be valid.</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> If you encountered this error by typing a URL in the Open URL dialog box, try opening the file by using a different transport protocol (for example, "http:" or "rtsp:"). The following list shows the protocols that are supported by the
 Player and examples of the correct URL syntax:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ mms://server/filename (for example, a file with a .wma, .wmv, .asf, or .mp3 extension)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
‚Ä¢ <a href="http://server/filename" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://server/filename</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
‚Ä¢ rtsp://server/filename<br />
&nbsp;<br />
‚Ä¢ mms://server/sami.asf?SAMI=http://server/sami/sami_demo.smi (SAMI file)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> If the Player supports the protocol that you used in the URL and you still can't play the content, verify that the Player is configured to use all of its supported protocols.</p>
<p><strong>To configure protocol settings</strong></p>
<p>1. In Windows Media Player, on the Tools menu, click Options.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;In the Options dialog box, on the Network tab, in the Streaming protocols area, select all the protocol check boxes (Multicast, UDP, TCP, and HTTP), so that a check mark is displayed in each.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note </strong>that the supported protocols can be used only to stream digital media files. Windows Media Player cannot be used as a browser.</p>
<p><strong>C)</strong> If the above fixes don't work, you can rename the networking information folder for the Player so that it can rebuild its networking information files after you restart it.</p>
<p><strong>To rename the Player networking information folder</strong></p>
<p>1. Close Windows Media Player. (To do this, on the File menu, click Exit.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Start, and then click Run.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. In the Run dialog box, type the following (exactly as shown):</p>
<p><strong>%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Media</strong></p>
<p>4. In this folder, rename the folder 11.0 to 11.0.bak. For more information about renaming folders, see To change the name of a file or folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Start the Player and try to stream the content again.<br />

<h2>            Self Service Returns</h2>
                    <p>I got a message about testing this feature but I had no eligible returns so I bought a 15$ game&nbsp;and played it for about 5 minutes. I then closed the app and went to the website and the option for the return/refund is there and I meet all criteria to receive the return:</p><p><br /></p><p>Played for less then 2 hrs</p><p>purchase is within 14 days</p><p>Console is on, connected to the internet and signed in</p><p>the game is currently closed</p><p><br /></p><p>I have even restarted the Xbox One X but I continue to get a error that pretty much says the system is having a issue gathering the data of how long I have played it.</p><p><br /></p>

 Make sure all the devices you installed the item on are powered on and

 To close the game on Xbox, press the Menu button and select Quit. To 
close it on your PC, select the X in the upper right of the window. If 
you continue to get this message, try restarting your devices.

    <title>Use old password for Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomass p‰ìtersons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use old password for Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I was installing Windows 10 on new computer for one client. But I wasn't be able to found Scan app pre-installed in Windows 10, so I dedicated download it from Windows Store app. On computer I was logged in with local account, so I just logged
 in with my private account to Windows Store using "Sign in to just this app instead". I downloaded and installed Windows Store app and I wanted to log out and remove my account from Windows Store from this computer. But..??? what Microsoft was eating before
 making this security for Windows Store? I wasn't be able to remove my account from Windows Store. When I tried sign in again, I just clicked on my account and IT WASN'T ASKING FOR MY PASSWORD. It just logged in. That was happening anyway, even after I changed
 my password at live.com for my account. Okay.. I thought ask for this in community, but before I do it, I tried change back my previous password. But..?? Microsoft, DO YOU THINK WITH THE BRAINS OR AS*?? Why.. WHY I can't change back to my previous password?
 Why I need use new password every time I change my password? How many sites are in all of the internet today? I am registered in lot of websites, so.. what happens if every website will ask for new password every time like you do? And not for easy password
 but for password with up/lower cases and number? How I can remember every different password for every site? Maybe I can save all my passwords in Note app into my mobile phone, also all my bank account passwords. Yea, nice. And.. my mobile phone will be steal
 or I just loose it. And other people which found my mobile phone will use all my passwords. Oh, pretty nice.
<span><span>Many people</span> <span>have complained</span> <span>about it, even 2 years ago. Why Microsoft can't make option or just ask for use "Are you really want use your old password?" with "Yes" and "No, let me choose new one"? WHY??</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Now I have password which I likely will forgot after one or two days. And next time I log in to Microsoft ac</span></span>count, I need choose option "I forgot my password". And this will happens every time, every time, Microsoft. EVERY TIME.
 So, where is security? For what is this security? <span><span>And even</span> <span>
in spite of</span> <span>all this, client for who I installed Windows 10, will be able sign in to Windows Store using my account, cause there wasn't option to forgot/remove/delete old account from Windows Store. Nice, just nice.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Programs and Features - Revert back to the default setting to confirm an uninstall</h2>
                    I thought it would be great to not be prompted to confirm my uninstall&nbsp;request, but have since changed my mind.&nbsp; The only problem is I'm not able to figure out (or find an answer) as to how to&nbsp;revert back to the default&nbsp;confirmation prompt.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>My problem is that yesterday all programs that I use with the&nbsp;Times New Roman&nbsp;font, started to display the text in Italics, even though Italics was turned off. I first noticed it with Yahoo Mail and then with MS Office 2003. I ran the sfc /scannow command
 and it fixed the problem in Yahoo Mail, but not in Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the fonts in Contriol Panel and&nbsp;discovered the problem. This is what is installed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Times New Roman Bold</p>
<p>Times New Roman Bold Italic</p>
<p>Times New Roman Italic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Times New Roman Regular is NOT installed, so Word is apparently using Italic as the next choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is how I can restore the Times New Roman Regular Font?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Okay, my problem is resolved. I searched and found the MS Core Fonts available as a free download. So, I downloaded it, installed it, and now everything is back to normal, so I'm all set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
<br />Then hit Enter
<br />
<br />or 
<br />
<br />Open Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
<br />
<br />Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
<br />
<br />Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
<br />
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
<br />
<br />As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn‚Äôt backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
<br />
<br />Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
<br />
<br />Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.

            The recycler and system volume information are default Windows folder and they are hidden by default and you won't be able to remove them. There are some malwares where they have the similar name and if that is the case, then you have to update your anti-virus
 and run a full system scan with it.

    <title>Halo CE&#58; Anniversary Achievements Not Unlocking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> footpickle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo CE&#58; Anniversary Achievements Not Unlocking</h2>
                    
<p>So I have two or three achievements that for whatever reason unlocked once but remained locked. That is to say, I played through certain missions and got the achievements but when I restarted my xbox, those missions and achievements were relocked and no
 matter how many times I play through it won't re unlock. To ensure that I have beaten them, I have gotten the achievement for beating the whole game on Heroic so the game realizes I have the mission beaten, just the achievement won't pop. This is also the
 case with the Terminals, the achievement for the finding the first won't reunlock, I hope this isn't the case that I am forever ripped off of 3 achievements.</p>
<p>I've tried clearing system cache, replaying missions on different difficulties, the only thing left is to try offline.</p>
<p>Please Help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with Halo ODST where achievements that were previously unlocked then re-appeared as locked both in game &amp; on Halo Waypoint. However, I started a new game on a new Xbox and all the achievements reappeared again after I finished the
 first level. Not sure why it happened but it might be worth trying.</p>

    <title>windows 7 midi controller unspecified device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scorpionradioscorpionradio  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 midi controller unspecified device</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
Originally I posted this question here :<br />
<br />
-<span style="font-style: italic">I have an Alesis Q49 midi controller that at one point DID work but no longer plays on my computer.</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I have tried researching what the issue could be and keep finding myself to Windows 7 Midi issues.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I am using a USB to connect the midi controller and when it is connected Windows recognizes the device and says it installs the drivers</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The one thing I can see that is apparent is under control panel my Midi device is unspecified</span>-<br />
<br />
After days and days of searching out answers I reached out to the Alesis support team and had numerous interactions with 3-4 techs in which nothing could be resolved. At one point I was directed to download these files specifically [Windows 7 - USB Audio Codec
 &amp; Windows 7 .INF .PNF Files ]. The results landed me with no audio at all. I did a restore in order to regain audio and still no results with my midi controller.<br />
One thing however did arise that is still in question. An updated Win Service pack install that came right before the crash of my controller.
<br />
Mind you, this is a 4 month old computer and a 4 month old midi controller. Both still in pristine condition and having no other issue whatsoever.<br />
Tests on the controller with other OS came up perfectly clean and useable.<br />
<br />
Is is possible that a recent updated Win Service Pack could have somehow messed up my USB settings so that it will not read my controller,hence why I am receiving a "unspecified controller" with the inability to direct my controller to the proper area?<br />
If so...what measures can I take to correct this?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur with other USB devices on the computer?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> If the
 device does not get detected then, run the </span><span>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to automatically try and fix the problem and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>‚ÄòOpen the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter‚Äô</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Update
 the drivers for the Alesis Q49 midi controller and check if the issue persists. Refer the following link to update the drivers.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‚ÄòUpdate a driver for hardware that isn't working properly‚Äô</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>: If the
 above step did not help then, uninstall and reinstall the USB controllers and check if the issue persists.

<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Which program are you talking about? The latest version of Windows Live Mail is 2012, build 16.4.3528.0331. There hasn't been any other version since then. Signatures are infinitely configurable in Windows Live Mail, with images, links and text formatting

<p>Does anyone else think that you should be able to sacrifice yourself (Shepard) to save all of your team members or even give Joker or Jack up as some sort of peace offering to the Collectors just so you don't have to go through the last stage and everyone
 can just live in peace and happiness?</p>

<p>Not to impugn on your ideas and such, but Shepard and company are already sacrificing themselves for the greater good. Not only for humanity's sake but for all sentient live in the universe. Besides, the Collectors are not interested in a barter or truce,
 since total annihilation of all sentient life is their main agenda, as it has been for a millennia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******Possible spoilers********</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Shepard confronted Vigil as to why a truce between the Reapers and the Protheans wasn't expressed, to which Vigil clearly stated that the reapers were not interested in one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******End of spoilers********</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, your idea in another context- where if Shepard's company were to trick the Collectors on Shepard's sacrifice- would make for an interesting play. :D</p>

<p>I hope Shepard dies at the end of ME3, it would be more appropriate than him/her living through 3 suicide missions. Plus it would wrap up the story, that a few must be sacrificed for the good of many. They should also make another series based on the Mass
 Effect universe, its just too amazing and deep to just see from one point of view. Maybe a MMORPG?</p>

<p>No, I own the Live account, it's under my email. But since I was under 18 when I made the account I needed to add her email as well (not as the main one, just as a "permission signature" in a sense) I don't think she even uses that email account anymore
 either, she got a new one :/</p>
<p>I'll try to call support and see what they can do for me, removing the need for parental permission if possible, since my account info should state my age, since I had to give that information when I made it.</p>

<p>He had used some school related account for "Parent" and he forgot the password. Since then, his account for the school was discarded and the option "Forgot password" was unavailable.</p>
<p>I hit this forum hoping for an answer, but we said "meh" and decided to play around a little with the settings and options first before really calling anywhere. Turns out, if you are indeed 18+ (dunno if under.) you can indeed disregard said Parent Account.</p>
<p>It's simple enough, first...</p>
<p>&gt;My Xbox</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;My Profile (A)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Account Management</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Leave Family</p>
<p>And well, it worked.</p>
<p>I dunno if it's the right sections but hey, find this "Leave Family" option and well, it worked.</p>
<p>Now JP can play Orcs Must Die all he wants. </p>

    <title>Something Went Wrong. Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t purchase any games or - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Something Went Wrong. Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t purchase any games or content, not even free ones.</h2>
                    
<p>So my account is having severe issues. I can't purchase games or add-on content either from within the console or on the xbox store website, including free games.</p>
<p>Every time I try, it reports back the error:</p>
<em>Something went wrong</em>
<div><em>Give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering the code below at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate.</em></div>

<div>(there is no code either).</div>

<div>I'm fairly sure (but can't be certain..) this is due to an ongoing billing problem with my account:</div>

<div>A while ago, MS announced the Xbox Digital TV Tuner was coming to Australia and they put it up for pre-order on the Microsoft Store. I placed a pre-order, all well and good. Since then I've been unable to buy any games, always getting the above error.</div>

<div>I talked to Xbox Support and they suggested it might be due to there being an outstanding balance on my account which is the pre-order for the tuner. The balance is due to pending/pre-auth transactions for the order:</div>

<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>28/01/2015</td>
<td>Standardaus</td>
<td>Pending</td>
<td>Visa: xxxxxxxx</td>
<td>$0.00</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>28/01/2015</td>
<td>Xbox One Digital Tv Tuner</td>
<td>Pending</td>
<td>Visa: xxxxxxxx</td>
<td>$39.95<br />
<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<div>Xbox Support then sent me off to the Microsoft Store support to get help there. MS Store support said that this is how pre-orders work, by pre-authorizing the sale and then they process the charge when it ships. Ok that makes sense. The rep also said he'd
 never heard of this causing any problems with xbox purchases.</div>

<div>Seeing as how I didn't have any options left, I decided I'd get the pre-order cancelled and just purchase the tv tuner elsewhere when it's released. They cancelled the order for me, however over a week later my account still shows the above pending transactions
 on my account and I still can't buy xbox games.</div>

<div>Additionally, I also want to remove the credit card from my account that I placed the pre-order under because I no longer use that card (I've added a new one and transferred my xbox live subscription to it already). Now it won't even let me remove that
 card, also because of those pending transactions:</div>
<div>
<em>Remove payment option</em>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>This payment option cannot be removed at this time due to one or more pending charges.&nbsp;<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Help/Show/toc_link_no_45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Please contact support if you need assistance.</a></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>I've live chatted with xbox and microsoft store support half a dozen times retelling the same story and I'm getting no resolution. I've even called them and been passed around multiple departments and no one can seem to sort out these transactions on my
 account or even manually remove the card.</div>

<div>So like I said, I can't be certain that my purchasing problems are because of this, but I can't see what else is going on.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I'm at wits end here and I'm sick of long winded repetitive conversations with outsourced support representatives and getting no resolution.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I want to buy and play games, I really do. But MS is really not helping me do that.</div>

<div><em>Please</em> fix my account!</div>
