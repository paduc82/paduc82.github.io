<h2>            Transferring Minecraft worlds</h2>
                    I have been looking at this problem for a while now and have no idea if there is someway I can export and save my minecraft xbox live worlds to my pc. If I can find how to open the game data files I can save the backups since I know how to find the actual
 worlds in the files and put them on my worlds folder in windows 10 minecraft. Could someone please help me here and I don’t want any answers including realms.

<p>Unfortunately, since Minecraft is not a Play Anywhere title, you can't migrate your Xbox Minecraft worlds to Windows 10 Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way to access saved data on your Xbox console or the cloud storage.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey there, I'm a map builder, what I do is transfer worlds from Xbox to Windows 10 using Realms. Upload the world on Xbox to a realm, download it on windows 10. As your post says you do not want realm answers, unfortunately there's no other way. Maybe
 this will change in the future.

    <title>AVI Files playing like scrambled video on all windows players - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smorkle  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVI Files playing like scrambled video on all windows players</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new camera that saves videos as .avi files. I thought the camera was having a problem because every video looks like a scrambled TV program on windows media player, movies &amp; TV app, movie maker, etc. The files play just fine on the camera itself
 but not on any windows player. As a last ditch effort I downloaded a free .avi player from cnet and the files play just fine. So I downloaded a file converter and was able to convert the files to mpeg to make them work on windows media player, but I'm still
 not sure if I have a problem with the camera writing corrupted .avi files or if there is a problem with windows media player, movies &amp; TV, etc. like there is some driver issue on my win10 laptop. I'm just confused.&nbsp; Any nudge in the right direction would be
 appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: We took the SD card that the camera uses and put it in my wife's windows 10 laptop and that worked just fine so the problem is definitely with my PC, not the camera.</p>

<p><strong>1. Have you update your computer drivers to the latest?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I check for updates frequently, at least 2-3 times a week. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to fix the issue?</strong></p>
<p>I have attempted to use every different type of program available on my computer and rescanned for any updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE discovered that since I installed this avi viewer (Aiseesoft free avi player) that the native Windows Photo Gallery now works fine but Movie Maker and TV&amp;Movies app still shows them garbled. I can work around the problem by using a file converter
 for the ones I want to keep and edit but it still seems weird that the files don't work automatically. It's as if there is a newer form of avi file that I'm missing a definition for or something.&nbsp; The problem seems to be on my computer only as they work fine
 on my wife's computer. </p>

<h2>            Graphics Card and Monitor Problems with new-build PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just rebuilt my PC with an Intel i7-4771 processor, an Asus Maximus VI Formula motherboard and 16GB RAM (Crucial) and Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have a number of display issues.&nbsp; I am currently running using the on-board graphics as I am unable to succesfully
 install a graphics card.&nbsp; I initially attempted to install my ATI Radeon X1950 Pro card, but could not find satisfactory drivers and the installation left Windows unable to identify my Dell U2312HM monitor.&nbsp; This left me with a very small image in the middle
 of my monitor screen.&nbsp; Changing to the on-board graphics resolved the problem.&nbsp; This last week I bought an Asus DirectCU II OC GeForce GTX660Ti card.&nbsp; On installation, the computer becomes very unstable and, if indeed it does start Windows, again it does not
 recognise the monitor, resulting in the small image in the middle of the screen.&nbsp; I have tried updating drivers for both the card and the monitor, but nothing I can think of fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a second problem, when running video from YouTube or BBC iPlayer (even when downloaded to my PC) I am suffering from regular frame-drops.&nbsp; This doesn't happen with DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has any ideas, I would be most grateful.</p>

            <p>Silly question perhaps, but did you install the chipset drivers for the motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there's something I discovered with graphic cards installation less than an hour ago. I've been trying to fix a problem which keeps cropping up in Event Viewer concerning an Nvidia file called nvinitx.dll on my brand new laptop. I won't go into that
 now though since it's hardly relevant to your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after uninstalling the previous drivers and rebooting, it would appear that the "Found New Hardware Wizard" runs silently in the backgound and installs whatever drivers it finds. When I say "silently", I mean it's invisible to you and therefore you can't
 stop it. If you try to go to Run and then run <strong>hdwwiz</strong>, you'll just get a message that another installation is already in progress and to try again later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent that happening just in case it's relevant, what you have to do is to go to Control Panel, then Windows Update and set it to "Never check for updates".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then disconnect the PC from the Internet. The Found New Hardware Wizard will still run, but won't be able to find any drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before performing both those steps, go to Program and Features&nbsp; and check to see if the Wizard has installed anything you weren't expecting.</p>

            <p>Just to add an alternative method of preventing the "Found New Hardware Wizard" from running in the background on Startup.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + Pause/Break to take you to "System".</li><li>In the left hand menu, click the link to "Advanced System Settings".</li><li>Next, click the "Device installation settings" button.</li><li>In the next menu, checkmark; "No, let me choose what to do" and "Never install driver software from Windows Update".</li><li>Remove the checkmark from: Automatically get the device app...etc.</li><li>Click Save Changes to exit.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience, installing drivers via Windows Update is best avoided anyway because it doesn't uninstall the current driver version first. This can lead to system instability.</p>

<h2>            Cannot uninstall Dell V515w printer from my computer</h2>
                    I am having a problem with my printer (Dell V515w) so after having tried many things, I decided to uninstall the printer from my computer.&nbsp; I disconnected it from the power source &amp; computer &amp; then went to the control panel clicked on to the printer and
 clicked uninstall. I was greeted with a message&nbsp; that my printer is not compatible with windows 10 o/s &amp; cannot be installed, so that confused me since it already is installed. In any event, I need to uninstall the printer.&nbsp;

            OK.&nbsp; I got the Dell V515w uninstalled from my computer then I tried to reinstall it and got:&nbsp; Not compatible with windows 10. Ok, so I started to read all of the suggestions &amp; didn't really connect on any of them. So, sitting here today, Sunday 2/3/19,
 I connected to the computer &amp; plugged it in and then I typed&nbsp; a letter, hit the print symbol &amp; bingo!, it printed my letter. go figure.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows10 blue screen, error, reboot loop won&#39;t let me access my laptop after complete install.</h2>
                    <p>Please Help,</p>
<p>I, after much waiting (12 hours), completed a download and install of Windows 10 on my Asus laptop. &nbsp;It appeared to finally work and be functioning last night, so I shut it down and went to bed. &nbsp;When I got up this morning and turned it on. &nbsp;It will boot
 up (very slowly), then give me the blue screen saying, "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. &nbsp;We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart the computer." &nbsp;I can't do anything. &nbsp;It does this over and over. &nbsp;I even tried very quickly
 to get into settings to revert back to Windows 7, but I can't get that far. &nbsp;At this point, after all the hassle, I would rather go back to the Windows 7. &nbsp; I seem to have gotten it to work on my CPU, but even that was a dreadful process. &nbsp;I just want Windows
 7 back on my laptop. &nbsp;I am missing a lot of work with this, please help. &nbsp;I just got, "Runtime error! Program: C/P R6016- not enough space for thread data" &nbsp;Whatever that means. &nbsp;In the download process it said my system was compatible...I don't care if it
 isn't please help me get back to Windows 7 so I can actually work.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for helping!</p>

<h2>            Japanese keyboard &#34;&#64;&#34; key not working on Windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>"@" key (</span><span>located to the right of the "P"</span><span>) on my&nbsp;</span><span>Japanese laptop has not been functioning
 correctly since upgrading from Japanese Windows XP to English Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason, it will either type an English keyboard "[" or else it switches the keyboard input method from Japanese to English.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to be able to switch between English and Japanese input, using a Japanese keyboard layout--basically what I was able to do before upgrading.</span></p>
<p><span>I should mention that I've already tried to reconfigure the registry using the following:</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>LayerDriver JPN</td>
<td>REG_SZ</td>
<td>kbd106.dll</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OverrideKeyboardIdentifier</td>
<td>REG_SZ</td>
<td>PCAT_106KEY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OverrideKeyboardSubtype</td>
<td>DWORD</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OverrideKeyboardType</td>
<td>DWORD</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</span>
<p><span>Any ideas?</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the input language settings I have installed:</span></p>
<p><span>(1) JP Japanese (Japan) /&nbsp;Keyboard: Japanese</span></p>
<p><span>This setting lets the key input match the keyboard layout, and the&nbsp;"@" key switches the keyboard layout to setting (3). But I'm not able to type in Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span>(2)&nbsp;JP Japanese (Japan) / Keyboard: Microsoft IME</span></p>
<p><span>With this setting, I can type in Japanese. And again, the key input matches the keyboard layout and the&nbsp;"@" key switches the keyboard layout to setting (3).</span></p>
<span>(3) EN English (United States) / Keyboard: US<br />
<span>(3) EN English (United States) / Keyboard: US<br />
</span>
<p><span>The English setting doesn't match the keyboard layout, and the&nbsp;"@" key types the standard US keyboard symbol "[".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Japanese layout will&nbsp;be the standard&nbsp;QWERTY layout. To type using a Japanese character set, you will need to add the Microsoft IME item under the Japanese keyboard section. After adding&nbsp;the IME, you can access the settings using the language bar.&nbsp;The
 symbols will still be in the default location (@ =&nbsp;Shift+2).</p>
<p>See the following link for tips on how to use Microsoft IME: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wit/archive/2009/01/14/how-to-use-microsoft-ime-to-input-east-asian-characters.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> sarwar518  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio isn&#39;t working, Windows 10</h2>
                    So I recently got this new PC (Zoostorm with an Asus 15"1) but for some apparent reason the audio doesn't work. I've tried most of the common ones (Playback devices, installing and uninstalling and wiring) but nothing seems to work! I also have an issue
 where it would automatically go to headphones instead of speakers. I'm not sure if it's the monitor that doesn't work which has built in speakers or it is the actual driver. ASUS says that there aren't any drivers for W10 so I'm really confused on how to fix
 this :(

</p><p>Yes I did get an error message but I apologize I did not capture it as it was a splash screen and then rebooted several times before allowing me the option to try something else. IE advanced boot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I did not try installing in compatibility mode as it was&nbsp;NVidia's driver&nbsp;stating it was&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows 10 and the Microsoft&nbsp;Update&nbsp;download driver didn't even give me a&nbsp;choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this was&nbsp;my work computer I had to revert back to the original OS installed.&nbsp; I will try again&nbsp;and see if I can capture more information for you.&nbsp;</p>

            OK so a little more information regarding this issue.&nbsp; The screen that pops up states UNEXPECTED_KERNAL_MODE_TRAP is the error and I can search online later for it.&nbsp; I have installed the latest ver driver from NVidia but no use.&nbsp;

<p>For people who have Dell T3500/R5500 and anything in that era of computers that use the NVidia Quadro NVS 295 you have download a Windows 10 x64 driver from NVidia.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a driver link below however if you wish to obtain it your self you have to go to&nbsp; the driver download page specific options listed below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product Type: "Quadro"</p>
<p>Product Series: "Show all Product Series" then select "Quadro NVS Series"</p>
<p>Product: "Quadro NVS 295"</p>
<p>Operating System: "Windows 10 64-bit"</p>
<p>Select the options that are applicable to your use and search...</p>

<p>if they are not appearing in the gamer pic section of the market place than it is more than likely they have been removed. keep checking back incase for what ever reason a glitch is causing you too not see these gamer pics in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and the company's that have content here reserve the right to remove their content at their own will.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Sometimes, the games themselves will unlock gamer pics as you play them or upon first insertion of the game. Though, you can also elect to buy avatar items for the team of your choice in the market place. So rather then a gamer picture for his favorite team,
 he can wear the teams jersey and show that off on the dashboard as well as in games that support it.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-CA/AvatarMarketplace?xr=shellnav&amp;Brand=14414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">marketplace.xbox.com/.../AvatarMarketplace</a></p>
<p><br />
Above is a link to the NFL avatar store, you should be able to find the same items if you chose avatar editor on the dashboard, and then go into marketplace items from the avatar store editor.</p>
<p><br />
Regardless of if it was a gamer picture or avatar item, you would still have to pay for the content, unless you have an Xbox live vision camera. &nbsp;Then you can take a screen shot of your favorite teams logo and use that as your picture.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Try and look through the extra downloads for Madden 12 and Madden 13. Also, check the avatar store. There's loads of NFL items in there. If all fails, the Gatorade gamer pics have Robert Griffin III. That's all I know.</p>

<h2>            Frequents bsods on Lenovo Thinkpad T450 laptop</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have a Thinkpad T450 that keeps rebooting without anything special apparently triggering it.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The error reasons are all over the place, pagefaults, driver overrun, kmode exceptions etc. It's freshly re-installed with the drivers updated by System Update from Lenovo and Driver Booster.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Attached please find the zipped file where I saved the minidumps, speccy export, bluescreen export, driverview and msinfo32 export.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Lenovo diagnostics does not seem to find anything wrong&nbsp; with it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Quickspecs:</p>
<p>- Windows 10 64 bit, 8GB ram, core I5-5300U, intel 5500 graphics, Liteon LCH-256V2S SSD</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Hopefully something points to the culprit, as it is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for any insight! :)</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, testing with Memtest gave an ocaasional memory error - as it is still under warranty the technician came and replaced the memory module. It has however not stopped the BSOD's, as they are still occurring occasionally. I updated also the SSD firmware,
 but it hasn't helped. I've even did a repair install of Windows 10 throwing out all the files and apps - but it hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uploaded the latest 3 minidumps, with the 1st two being with driver verifier running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.mediafire.com/file/vgwljm0xb3svwxq/041317-5796-01.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further ideas by any chance?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The windows installation is a repair one with nothing kept (applications or anything else) from the previous ones, with only the updates from Lenovo applied through their System Update program. As it's a laptop I cannot disconnect anything :( According to
 Windows Update it is fully up-to-date with the latest patches/drivers</p>

I would like to inform you that you can still use Media player version 9.0</p>
<p>Please uninstall Media Player 11 or 10 that is installed into your system after that it automatically rollback Media player 9.0 into your system.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you want to enable "<strong>Skype Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office 2013</strong>" addin and let the “<strong>New Skype Meeting</strong>” icon appear. About enabling the add-in, have you tried adding
<strong>UCAddin.dll</strong>? After adding it, you can see “<strong>Lync Meeting Scheduling Outlook Add-in</strong>” in COM Add-Ins, and then “<strong>New Skype Meeting</strong>” icon will appear.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I suggest you uninstall Office 2013 and then install Office 2016 to check if the issue persists.</span></p>

    <title>Task Scheduler shutdown of individual IE session - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed9213  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler shutdown of individual IE session</h2>
                    When I travel, the IT Dept. wants to keep track of my local IP.
<div>I have a scheduled task that runs, using IE9.</div>
<div>I can't duplicate all the secure site info here, but as an example, this illustrates:</div>
<div>In&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 Pro, the scheduled task Action is - Start a Program -&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</div>
<div>and the argument could be&nbsp;http://whatismyip.com. &nbsp;It runs at the same time every night.</div>
<div>That starts a new session of IE9, runs to the URL, accomplishes that task, and stays on until morning, when I have to manually close it. &nbsp;</div>
<div>How can I shut down just this scheduled task session of IE9 after it executes? &nbsp;(Other Internet suggestions include Taskkill, but that shuts down all IE sessions. &nbsp;Since I might have been working on issues when I go to sleep, shutting them down also doesn't
 work out for me.)</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

                    <p>I purchased the game Conan Exiles back while it was in the preview phase of the game. I was told I will recieve a code for Conans Royal Armor when the game goes to full release which was on May 8th. This was to be exclusive to people who purchased the game during the preview phase. I have yet to recieve my code. Its been over a month..and I've contacted support for the 3rd time as of today. Its becoming frustrating that noone has been able to help thus far til now. Cedrick directed me to you for assistance. Please send me my code.</p>

<p>Hello Scarecrow419!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, if you were promised in-game content, it's already out, and the Xbox is saying you don't have that content, then the best thing for you to do is to try to contact the developer for the game outright and see if that's something that they can help you
 with. </p>
<p>Forums support can't create codes or check for entitlements. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try to contact Funcom at their <a href="https://www.funcom.com/help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support site </a>and see if that helps resolve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            So the problem is I've contacted funcom already. They have said they do not make codes for Xbox..that's what Microsoft does. They just release the game content and Microsoft sends out the codes. It comes in the message system. My buddy got his and that's
 how it worked for him. So after talking to multiple agents at Microsoft they told me to contact you guys here at sales and promotions since it was a promotion. Your own people said to talk to you. So that's why I'm here. It was promotional content I was suppose
 to recieve a code for to download because I bought the game during the preview phase. You can check my account and see the date of purchase was clearly before the official release date. Again Funcom does not control how xbox live works. They provided the game
 content and Microsoft supplies the download codes to those who were suppose to get them. (Which clearly someone dropped the ball on).&nbsp; Now maybe you are not the specific person that does that since you are forum support but som

    <title>Changing the color of the Taskbar in Windows 10 ONLY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soulblazer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the color of the Taskbar in Windows 10 ONLY</h2>
                    <p>So I hope I can explain this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 and I know if right click on the desktop, then select Personalize, then Colors, you can turn either On or Off the settings for 'Show Color on Start, Taskbar, action center, and title bar'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a all in one setting, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have it ON, then the taskbar and Start is a nice light blue, which matches my desktop (old fashioned blue from earlier Windows versions), very pleasing to the eye.&nbsp; But all of the title bars for anything I run (browser, apps, etc.) is ALSO a light blue,
 which I do NOT want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have it OFF, then the title bars are a nice white, but my taskbar at the bottom of the screen is a ugly black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to change the color of the taskbar ONLY -- idealy so it's a light blue -- but leave the color on the title bars as white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been all over the net and can't find anyone who has addressed this specific issue!&nbsp; Please help.</p>

<h3> bignoddy55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update on multiple computers</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have 4 computers running Windows 8.1 ProWMC - two are 32bit and two are 64bit. I would much prefer to receive a 32bit ISO and a 64bit ISO and only do two downloads, instead of having to do the download on each machine. So far I have reserved a copy for
 32bit version and a 64bit version and hope to "reuse" on the other machines. Is this possible?
</p>
<p>If not, what were you thinking Microsoft? The updates on all 4 machines would consume my entire monthly quota.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting your reply.</p>

            What if I have more than one Windows device—can I upgrade them all? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes, you can get a free upgrade for each of your eligible Windows devices. All you need to do is make a separate reservation for each device you want to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>multiple computers, do have to download Windows 10 on each computer?
</strong></p>
<p>You can download a .ISO file and upgrade each computer offline. The ISO should be available by the time Windows 10 launches.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-from-previous-versions-of-windows/31722b30-1da9-42bb-b331-0edc4649bf43" title="As we approach the launch of Windows 10 this summer, hundreds of millions of existing Windows users will be taking advantage the opportunity to upgrade their current version to Windows 10 for free. This represents an unprecedented change in Microsoft's business model of requiring purchase of a license. Windows 10 will be offered two ways to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 users. You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed. Also for persons with limited bandwidth, this will be an excellent way avoid the need to download the update more than once if you have multiple computers. So lets take a look at upgrading 
 to: upgrade from previous versions of Windows using Windows 10 ISO file</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license for
 Windows 10 Pro or rollback Windows 7 Home Premium and upgrade to Windows 10 Home.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Which features will be removed when I upgrade from a previous version of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows Media Center</li><li>DVD playback</li><li>Desktop gadgets</li><li>Preinstalled games</li><li>Floppy drive support</li><li>Windows Live Essentials (Windows Essentials)</li><li>Windows Updates</li><li>Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode</li></ul>
<p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

<h2>            X453MA Motherboard ASUS - Boot path not shown on BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with a laptop here. ASUS Laptop model F453M. It encountered a problem with the HDD. After troubleshooting and diagnosis I found that the HDD is faulty. It's been infected with malware and virus. I couldn't remove the malware using Malwarebyte
 so I decided to reset the PC.</p>
<p>Even the reset option wasn't working. I backed up all data, had no option but to format the HDD and re-install Windowd 10 OS. &nbsp;The HDD was removed, connected to a machine via SATA cable (not as a removal hard disk) and began with the formatting and reloading
 of Windows 10 OS. The Windows 10 OS license was activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once completed, I fitted back the HDD into the laptop (ASUS). Powered on the laptop, but unfortunately it did not boot from the HDD. The BIOS can be seen, when i checked the Boot tab, there was no booot sequence configured. I can't even add the boot path.
</p>
<p>Now the laptop could not boot up even the Windoes 10 OS is installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what can be done next? I understand the motherboard is still working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help from this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Ok, but usually most of the time it does not work because the motherboards are different, I hope it works for you, and it would have happened "chkdsk" to rule out any problem in the Hard Disk.
