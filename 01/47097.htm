<h2>            two accounts with same email</h2>
                    <p>Hello:=)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today i realized something very weird and wanted to ask if somebody knows the answer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought Office 2016 and wanted to use the free Skype minutes. Then by signing in i came to a different account of mine in Skype and wondered where this account came from.. After that i turned back and signed in with my original account and found out
 that both accounts are using the same email! How is that possible? I mean maybe i opened a new account several years ago but how is it possible to use the same email in two accounts of Skype? I don't think that it was someone else trying to hack me! Just curious
 how this works...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the minutes are in a different account..</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the help!</p>

<p>I have the same exact issue. Incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having a major security breach at work and there is absolutely no way to contact customer live support here on MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype account BEFORE MS purchased them...MS decided to give all their users a Skype account. Now I have 2 skype accounts. The old one is compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to delete it, throws me into a coding logic flow problem. This should be fixable my MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my information gets compromised who do I go for help? No one in the community will be able to help me, MS is liable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello guys, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you used your email address to sign in, it will create a new account preceded by "live:".
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You can access&nbsp;your old account using the very credentials you have used to create it (usually&nbsp;a Skype name) to sign in, or you have used a different email address to create the old one.
</strong>You'd be able to log in to the "live" account using your email address, since it was created using the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly try signing in using your Skype name or the correct email address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your account has been compromised, kindly refer to this link to reset the password:

<div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can not.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On my old Skype account and my new MS account (that also has Skype) are using the same exact email address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
When I attempt to sign in to MS using my old Skype account I get the following&nbsp;</div>

<div>
</span></div>
<div>
This prevents me from logging into MS and disabling Skype for the that old account, deleting that account, removing any personal private information from that account and presents itself as an overall security risk.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
My New MS account was made during the Xbox360 era...before Skype was purchased and or linked with MS.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I can log into my New MS account and I see that my new Skype account is linked there, however I'm missing my contacts and ability to link Facebook as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Probably because Facebook is linked to my old account.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I should be able to merge both using the same email address. Well that's if you guys make it so.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Facebook login accounts are no longer supported, that means there is no longer an option as well to link a Skype account to Facebook. All Facebook login accounts have been deprecated on January 10. If you wish to delete the old account
 which you believe have been compromised, you need to recover it first. <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yes with the bug I'm presenting to you guys, delinking it is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to make a video to show you guys the Logic problem with Skype and having two Skype accounts that use the same exact email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since they both link back to MS now, it's impossible to get through on the older one, as I pointed out in my previous comment</p>

<p>2 Skypes accounts that share the same phone number and email address.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a shame.&nbsp; I will construct then a play by play jpeg sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A person with 2 MS/Skype accounts with the same email address has tremendous amounts of friction to delete the compromised account. I had to tell all my banks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you guys are comprehending the seriousness of the logic flaw in your system. Please don't read off a CS script.&nbsp; Try it for yourselves. Create two MS accounts with the same email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot, it seems that you're being asked to update your Skype account to a Microsoft account. With that, kindly add a phone number that has not been associated&nbsp;with any Microsoft account or get a new Outlook account.

<h2>            what is the hd video out port on my surface rt 32gb called&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface RT and don't want to spend $40 for Microsoft's HDMI adapter, (that hasn't been in stock for awhile now anyways). I attempted to buy an adapter on amazon and got one for an apple product. Can anyone tell me hat the hd video out port on my
 Surface RT is called? Is it a micro HDMI type c?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I picked up a $7 Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable on Amazon.com, and it works perfectly. You might want to try a generic cable before putting out the higher price for the official one.</p>

<p><em>This would be less an issue if MS bothered to add Miracast capable WDDM 1.3 drivers to Surface RT - alas they pimp the very people who were early adopters of their new product even though other Tegra 3 based tablets do provide Miracast capabilities -
 way to go MS, really encourages folks to buy into your later products when they know you're unlikely to support those any better</em></p>

<h2>            Probl&#38;&#35;232&#59;me de renouvellement automatique</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>J'ai abonné mon compte xbox live, mais par manque de moyens financiers, je dois résilier cette abonnement.</p>
<p>Cependant, j'ai beau appelé le service xbox live, je n'arrive jamais a le résilier..</p>
<p>Je n'arrive pas a retirer &nbsp;mon moyen de paiement non plus...</p>
<p>Puis-je le faire par &nbsp;ordinateur ? car par téléphone, a n'importe quelle heure où j'appelle, on me met en attente pour un temps limité, mais ce temps limité est toujours dépassé, et j'attend, j'attend, j'attend, et rien ne se passe..</p>

<p>Comment faire ? Cela commence à vraiment m'énerver...</p>
<p>Merci à ceux qui ont une solution ou si le support m'entend et répond a ma requête.</p>

                </div>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>il n'y a que le support qui peut résilier ton abonnement automatique, perso je te conseille d'éviter de contacter le support le soir ou les week-end c'est là où il y a le plus de monde.</p>
<p>Essaie de les contacter en journée, mais c'est étrange parceque à chaque fois que j'ai téléphoné &nbsp;j'ai toujours réussi à avoir le support. Tu ne dois pas avoir de chance...</p>
<p>Bon courage et bonne continuation.</p>

<p>Trois points important:</p>

<p>[quote user="Conditions d'utilisation du Xbox Live"]</p>
<p><b>6.3. Facturation</b></p>
<p>En indiquant à Microsoft un mode de paiement, vous&nbsp;: (i) déclarez être autorisé à utiliser le mode de paiement que vous avez indiqué&nbsp;; (ii) autorisez Microsoft à vous facturer le Service en utilisant votre mode de paiement&nbsp;; et (iii) autorisez Microsoft
 à vous facturer les fonctionnalités payantes du Service auxquelles vous choisissez de vous abonner ou que vous utilisez lorsque le présent contrat est en vigueur. Nous pouvons facturer les Services de l’abonnement&nbsp;: (a) à l’avance&nbsp;; (b) au moment de l’achat&nbsp;;
 (c) peu après l’achat&nbsp;; ou (d) selon des échéances régulières. Nous pouvons vous facturer à hauteur du montant que vous avez approuvé. Nous vous informerons à l’avance de toute modification tarifaire pour les Services de l’abonnement. Nous pouvons facturer
 simultanément plusieurs de vos périodes de facturation antérieures.</p>
<p><b>6.4 Renouvellement automatique</b></p>
<p>Nous pouvons renouveler automatiquement votre Service (sous réserve que les renouvellements automatiques soient autorisés dans votre pays) en appliquant les tarifs en vigueur. Nous vous informerons par courrier électronique avant tout renouvellement et nous
 vous rapellerons le mode de paiement désigné qui sera utilisé. Nous vous fournirons également des instructions pour annuler le Service. Vous devez annuler le Service (reportez-vous à l’article 6.10 ci-dessous) avant la date de renouvellement pour que celui-ci
 ne vous soit pas facturé.[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Comme écrit par o Master o Drk plus haut, l'appel au support technique est gratuit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Le 800 91 52 74 est gratuit depuis un poste fixe </li><li>Le 01 55 69 80 61 vous coutera le prix d'une communication locale </li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. L'inscription d'une carte bancaire sur votre compte n'est pas obligatoire. Il existe des cartes prépayées qui vous éviterons d'enregistrer vos coordonnées bancaire ...</p>

    <title>Why am I unable to redownload steam onto my new laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kryszianhoffman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I unable to redownload steam onto my new laptop&#63;</h2>
                    I have a few games through steam that I had bought, and it's frustrating that I am limited to only what's available in the Microsoft store, when what I want isn't even THERE. And sure, there may be some 'alternate options' in the store, but I personally
 don't trust them to give me the games I BOUGHT. I want the actual Steam, not some knockoff that may or may not have all of my games available to me that I had BOUGHT. And for all I know, there may be some bypass BS due to being the administrator/owner of my
 device, but alas, I'm not a techie and as far as I've seen, there's no option to say 'screw this bs, I do what I want and will deal with the consequences'. I would like answers.

<h2>            Cannot install Java JDK in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I cannot install Java JDK on this computer. Right in the beginning of the installation it comes up with error 2203.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624295fc-6f42-4805-85b5-4c2311d511bd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624295fc-6f42-4805-85b5-4c2311d511bd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at other posts about this but they did not help and they are old.<br />
</p>
<p>I launched the jdk-11.0.1_windows-x64_bin.exe as administrator and it does the same thing. I checked the permissions on the&nbsp; the&nbsp;C:\Windows\Installer folder security tab in properties and it has&nbsp; "System",&nbsp; "Adminstrators (as my account)" and "Everyone"
 in the Group or User names. Both System and Administrators have everything checked in permissions. "Everyone" just has 3 read&nbsp; related check marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp folder has "Owners Rights" and my account name but not as administrator like it is in the System folder, listed in Groups or user names. Owner rights has no check marks in permissions and my account has everything
 checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem for a long time and I have not been able to update to any other versions of Java JDK. The version that is on here is Java 6 update 20 from 5/17/11</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so ridiculous not to be able to install so many different things because of this problem. Please help me get this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I do not know the direct answer to your question.&nbsp; However, I will offer a bit of advice:&nbsp; Switch to the Chrome browser.&nbsp; Chrome does not need Java.&nbsp; I have advised all my clients to do this and removed Java, along with Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash player
 from their computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a good thing because those 3 programs are some of the most commonly used entry points for viruses and hackers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, over 60% of computers on the Internet now use Chrome.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding! I was getting the feeling no one was going to respond. I have been using Chrome for a long time. I have had a lot of problems with Chrome but I won't go into that now. :) I need Java's JDK so I can install the Java IDE for programming.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the Microsoft techs from the Philippines and India that have tried to solve this installation problem I have for installing anything, have not been able to fix it. They have, in fact, made everything worse because they created problems that I did
 not have before they worked on my computer. I literally have logged 50 hours with all of these techs and that does not include the time I wasted trying their suggestions or waiting for something they did to finish running, which never finished successfully....
 :) This has been going on for about 3 years. I even sent a snail mail letter to Microsoft, as the person at Microsoft headquarters in Washington state told me I had to do in order to get a message to any one at a higher level, telling them all the problems
 I have been having and how the techs have not been able to fix the problem. I told them very specifically not to just hook me up with yet another tech from the Philippines or India. They ignored everything I had written in my letter. What did they do? They
 hooked me up with a tech from the Philippines!&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Microsoft" tech support is very sketchy.&nbsp; None of them are Microsoft employees.&nbsp; I have seen lots of terrible outcomes from their "support."&nbsp; So, I am not surprised to hear this.&nbsp; It is a common story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to Microsoft, customer service is a lost art.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best advice, considering all that you have gone through:</p>
<p><strong>Re-install Windows 7 completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a laptop and the hard drive is 5 years old or older, replace it as part of the re-install.&nbsp; If yours is a desktop, and the hard drive is 8 years or more, replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need detailed instructions on how to this reinstall, I would be happy to provide them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, most of my 130 client computers use Chrome and none of them have any problems.&nbsp; IE has not had any work done on it in years.&nbsp; The team was dispersed years ago.&nbsp; Chrome is under active development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you should understand clearly that Windows Update is a terrible mess and is making many systems into scrap heaps.&nbsp; If you have allowed WU to continue on your computer since the end of 2014, there is likely an explanation for the mess you have in there
 somewhere.&nbsp; Read more:</p>

<p>Hey CT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detailed response! I think Microsoft went downhill when Gates left. I think there is something wrong with the people running it now. I heard they have a collective IQ equivalent to a pile of dirt... lol :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contemplated reinstalling Windows but I did not want to lose all the things that came with this laptop. I would have to find each one individually and possibly pay for each one as I'm sure Toshiba will not cooperate and give them to me separately.
 They do have the system on a thumb drive or DVD for about $20, but I am a little distrustful that, it might be corrupted because I have a rescue thumb drive with the original system that I used several times when the microshi$#! techs were ruining my system..
 lol :) Windows 7 on this thumb drive and most likely on their paid system drive, would not have SP 1 or 2 included in it. I was one of the things the techs were trying to fix and install. It took hours and hours and they introduced new problems to my system.
 I will have to go through and see how many things I would care about restoring that came with this system and then check with Toshiba if I can get them separately. I prefer the old way they did things when they gave you all the software on cds when you bought
 the computer. There used be a way to try to do a fix on Windows where it goes through and reinstalls many of the files but I don't know if you can still do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Chrome without any problems for years. I think about a year ago, it started&nbsp; not being able to download the updates. It would just sit there with the icon in motion indicating it was downloading but after about 5 minutes it would say there was
 an error. I have had so many problem on this computer trying to update or install anything that I was reluctant to try to reinstall Chrome any way. Some things will install and update like Avast anit-virus and Adobe flash etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to find out from Chrome for almost a year how to preserve, as in what file or files to back up in order to save all my visited link data so that if I reinstall, I can put that file back in place and still have all the visited links showing
 up in red as I have it set. I also would like to move or rename that file temporarily if for some reason I would want to keep someone else that might want to use my laptop, from snooping.&nbsp; Not one single person has been able to answer this for me. I would
 like to contact an actual programmer at Chrome that worked on or designed Chrome as I'm sure he would have to know the answer. I have assumed that it is the "visited links" file under&nbsp; C:\Users\my user name\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default&nbsp; &nbsp;and
 maybe the history file too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I tried saving the file and deleting everything in the copied on and putting that in place so there would be no visited link information. But when I ran Chrome it still showed my visited links in red. I'm using an extension to set the color I want
 for visited links rather than Chrome's default purple which does not stand out when looking at all the blue unvisited links... at least to my eyes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you happen to know?&nbsp; Or do you know how to contact someone at Google?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem with Google was that it started forcing the Chrome sign in page to open when I started Chrome as it was trying to sync all my devices. But I don't have any other devices and I never wanted this to be enabled. But it would pop open this
 page and if I tried to open another tab or do anything it would lock up saying "Not Responding". It would take a couple of minutes before it stopped and I was able to use Chrome again. Then one day it started opening the page quickly. It did this for maybe
 a month and then it started being slow again. About a month or so ago, it started behaving normally with no sign in page at all. But at the same time, the first time I try to download anything, it will lock up as in "Not responding" for 75 seconds before letting
 go. Then it is ok the rest of the time. I have also lost some extensions and I did not disable or remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm debating about giving in a buying another computer and then I can use this one as just a back up or for my music, recording my playing and writing etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry this was so long... Are you still awake? lol :)</p>

<p>I will repeat:&nbsp; You need to replace the hard drive and install Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can and should backup Chrome Bookmarks.</p>
<p>

<li>Upper right corner of Chrome you will see 3 vertically aligned dots, click that</li><li>Bookmarks</li><li>Bookmark manager</li><li>Now you will see another set of 3 vertically aligned dots under the top one, click that</li><li>Choose Export bookmarks</li><li>Save</li></ol>

<p>Now that is good info:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First,</strong> you need to understand that laptops do not live a long life.&nbsp; 50% are no longer usable after 5 years.&nbsp; Yours is now going on 8 years and is in its senior later life stages, statistically speaking.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, the guideline is you should not allow your hard drive to reach more than 75% available space in use.&nbsp; The reason for that guideline is that after 75%, the system will begin thrashing (looking for space) and will suffer performance
 reduction.&nbsp; As that goes higher and higher it will get worse until at some point it will no longer operate.&nbsp; Yours is over 95% in use and it is a wonder it works at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome uses a lot of memory.&nbsp; When your computer is working, it writes off parts of what is in memory to the hard drive to restore usable memory.&nbsp; Probably the reason your system is floundering using Chrome is because it cannot find space on the hard drive
 to put that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSD drives wear each time they are written to.&nbsp; That's a physical fact, not a matter of opinion.&nbsp; That's why you should never defrag an SSD, or write zeros on it.&nbsp; A too-full SSD will probably wear out faster because it is moving things around to make space.&nbsp;
 Zero writing on a disk drive is something used for high intelligence, high security installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When SSD drives begin to fail, they tend to fail completely with little warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume the Avast version you have installed is their "security" suite, not just AV.&nbsp; If that is the case, and you need to diagnose problems, start by completely removing it.&nbsp; Security suites will actively work to hide the problems.&nbsp; I look after over
 100 systems and will not even attempt a diagnosis until it is removed completely.&nbsp; &nbsp;Removed completely means using the vendors removal software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes is an installed app that has been known to conflict with "security" programs.&nbsp; I used if for years, but then discovered ADWcleaner, which is not an installed app and cannot conflict.&nbsp; It is downloadable scanner.&nbsp; It is free.&nbsp; It is so good Malewarebytes
 bought it.&nbsp; It is much faster and just as good.&nbsp; If you brought me your computer, I would remove Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Spybot is overkill.&nbsp; You only need to use ADWcleaner once in a while.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Parallel Installation - Win 8.1 in C&#58; Drive &#38; Win 10 in D&#58; Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have subscribed to auto upgrate on 29th July. Currently in my laptop Win 8.1 is on C: Drive.
</p>
<p>1. Will I have a choice to install the Win 10 on E: Drive? I don't want to touch C: drive at-all.</p>
<p>2. Will the installation steps ask me what customized applications are needed to be installed?</p>
<p>3. The WiFi connection settings are fixed and passwords are all stored with Win 8.1; If the installation does not happen in the E: Dirve, will my setting be deleted in C: Drive?</p>
<p>4. If the installation does not happen in E drive, do I need to remove all my data from C drive to other drive?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Rishu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Yes, you will have an option to install Windows 10 in E: Drive.&nbsp;In other&nbsp;words you can do a Dual boot of Windows 10 on a single machine. But make sure that you have a free space in the Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yes, While installing Windows 10 you will have an option to customize the&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If you are doing Dual boot in other drive and if it fails while installation then it won't effect the settings which are there in other&nbsp;Operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Before performing Dual Boot, I suggest you to take a back of data and applications which are there in&nbsp;other Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the&nbsp;Wi-Ki article for more information.</p>

            <p>You can do this but it is a little trickier. Here is my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I understand correctly, you have 2 partitions at this moment: a drive C were your current windows resides and a drive D, probably with your files (this is also my setup)</li><li>The first step will be to create a partition for Windows 10 (cut part of drive D). You can do this in disk manager. If you don't know how, please ask and I will give you the details</li><li>Create a system image of your current Windows</li><li>Upgrade your current Windows to Windows 10 (you cannot skip this part if you want the free upgrade)</li><li>Restore your previous Windows to it's current location (partition)</li><li>Do a clean install of Windows 10 in the partition you reserved in step 2</li></ol>
<p>Windows 10 will see that you have another windows installation and add it to the boot manager. At this point you will be able to boot both Windows versions</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have subscribed to auto upgrate on 29th July. Currently in my laptop Win 8.1 is on C: Drive.
</p>
<p>1. Will I have a choice to install the Win 10 on E: Drive? I don't want to touch C: drive at-all.</p>
<p><strong>Will I have the option of choosing a different drive or partition where I want the upgrade installed?</strong></p>
<p>No, it will require that you are running a previous qualifying version and start the upgrade from within the qualifying version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Will the installation steps ask me what customized applications are needed to be installed?</p>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The WiFi connection settings are fixed and passwords are all stored with Win 8.1; If the installation does not happen in the E: Dirve, will my setting be deleted in C: Drive?</p>
<p><strong>Again, you can't dual boot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to dual boot instead of replace my current version of Windows.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to install Windows 10 on a separate hard disk or partition, you will need to purchase a full license.</p>

</p><p>4. If the installation does not happen in E drive, do I need to remove all my data from C drive to other drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">How

<p>Do they mean that you being the microsoft emplyee don't know what the product features are? Or simply other's are more intelligent than microsoft employee to get the inside story and complete feature of Win 10 before Microsoft emplyee????</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well I get your point it's an upgrade and not a fresh installation, therefore no data showld be deleted by the system on it's own. Though better to have backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another solution to dual boot, I can have the copy of my orignal 8.1 on another drive (say D:). Meanwhile upgrade the drive (C:) i.e. Win8.1 to Win10. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files. <br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode : 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116</strong><br />
<br />
The VIDEO_TDR_ ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000116. This indicates that an attempt<br />
to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed. <br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The inclusion of the 116 error code in the troubleshooter is only coincidence and holds no<br />
specific meaning (other than driver caused bluescreens do occur with some frequency).<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            <p>As the majority of us would have no idea what "KHS" actually is you are more likely to get software application specific support from the developer web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the donation side it would entirely depend on what conditions the developer places on their software. If reinstalling requires a payment we could not possibly assist you to circumvent that.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to identify if this is a driver related issue, I suggest you to try uninstalling the driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the driver upon restart.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Locate the driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result, we will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>How install updates on a 32GB notebook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thilak wijayawickrama  say:</h3>
<h2>            How install updates on a 32GB notebook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to update windows but the progress is stuck at 4%. I checked the Ethernet tab under task manager and there was zero network traffic. My HDD have only 9GB left so I guess there isn't enough storage?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is how am I supposed to install updates? I read that you can install by plugging a USB drive but I don't know how that works. Can someone tell me how to expand the storage so I can update? Will using an external HDD work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current OS version is 1703 and build 15063.608. Device is Acer Aspire A114-31-C4HH</p>

            Hi Thilak, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only two answers, don't update or backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Fresh start should only be used if your having issues with Windows. Its the same option you get with the troubleshooting option to reset your computer. Yes you would have to do those commands again when unplugging the USB. I personally use a Micro SD card in my computer to install updates to to save my main drive. With a Micros SD you cant tell because its so small and they come in pretty large sizes, like 256GB.

</p><p>I opened the windows calculator and it opened full page Why? There's no X in the upper right hand corner to close the calculator, I have to go to my system tray and right click and select close window to close it. Why all the steps just to close any window?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I would like to ask if the issue persists with other Windows Apps as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to press/hold the left click button on the title bar of the calculator and drag the Windows to shrink&nbsp;the size&nbsp;of the Windows and check if&nbsp;the close (X) option appears. If the issue still persists, then suggest&nbsp;you to run the&nbsp;Windows Store
 Apps troubleshooter by following the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” in search box and press Enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>View all</strong> on top left pane.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select “<strong>Windows Store Apps</strong>” from the list and follow the prompts for troubleshooting.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the troubleshooter found no issues, I suggest you to uninstall and re-install the app to check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Follow the steps below to uninstall and reinstall the
<strong>Calculator app</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo</strong> key on the keyboard, type <strong>PowerShell</strong>, right click on the top most search result and select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. Provide administrators password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage *windowscalculator* | Remove-AppxPackage</strong> in the command box and press
<strong>Enter</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Close the PowerShell command, go to Windows Store and install
<strong>Calculator app</strong> and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, check if similar issue occurs on another user profile. Create another user
 account by referring to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Set up accounts</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;on
 Windows 10 article. This is only to determine if the issue is OS specific or user account specific.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of Calculator app showing irregular behavior on the computer for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            How to copy MSVCP71.dll</h2>
                    Had to install a new&nbsp;hard drive.&nbsp; Reinstalled Vista and copied files from a backup exterior hard drive.&nbsp; When trying to start some programs I am advised "Application failed to start because MSVCP71.dll was not found." Then was advised I need
<strong>MSVCP71.dll</strong> copied to <strong>%Systemroot%\System32</strong>.&nbsp; I downloaded as advised and selected "RUN" for the requested file
<strong>"Microsoft.NET Version 1.1 Redistribution Package</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still cannot start the programs in question and receive the same reason. Do I need to find the
<strong>"MSVCP71.dll"</strong> file within this prgram and copy it to <strong>"%Systemroot%\System32"</strong>?&nbsp; If so I really need a
<strong><em>detailed step by step guide to doing so.&nbsp; </em></strong>I will checl back&nbsp;later for your suggestions.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

<p><span>Hello Paul1937,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried looking on the Vista disk that you have to see if the file is available? You might be able to get the file somewhere online but I would advise
 against it since the file could have damaging properties along with it if obtained from the wrong place.</span></p>
<p><span>In my research I have found that this file is most likely provided by the company that developed the software that is being affected on your computer. You
 might try contacting the manufacturer/developer of the software and see if they can provide support for their product.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Play&#47;Pause key does not work with Media Player or Groove Music</h2>
                    All the other keys work and the same key works as an F4 key when FN is pressed. I have not tried the play/pause key with any other media player. Does anyone have any suggestions? Has anyone had success with this key working on their type cover?
