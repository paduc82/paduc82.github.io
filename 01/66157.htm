<h2>            How to select &#39;browser apps&#39; as default apps for opening documents&#47;files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As most people know, browsers like Google Chrome and probably the new MS Edge can 'create' applications for some websites like Gmail, Outlook, OneNote, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a lot of these Apps, some of them are from Google, like Documents and Sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how I change Windows default Apps to be the Web Apps?</p>
<p>When changing the default app in advanced options "by file type" I can select Chrome, or I can select the Chrome App, let's say Chrome Docs for .doc, .docx files.</p>
<p>The problem is that it just doesn't work. Chrome opens, not the web app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the App properties it's clear that it launches a Chrome instance in its own window, but doesn't work for Windows Default Apps.</p>
<p>Destiny:&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome_proxy.exe"&nbsp; --profile-directory=Default --app-id=bojccfnmcnekjgjhcaklmcgofnngpjcl</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start:&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application"</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi BobCosta
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />So, if my interpretation is right, you want to open a particular file type by redirecting the click to that particular web app. Could you please confirm the understanding?       
        </p>

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />I am sorry this cannot be done in Windows . . .
<br />
<br />There is no way in Windows to set an online App as a default app for file associations, Windows only allows local apps or applications to be set . ..

<p>Hi Vijay!</p>
<p>Yes, you are absolutely correct. That's exactly what I want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>I click on document.doc</p>
<p>Windows should fire the Google Docs application (the installed web app in its own Window), not on Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the S.O. doesn't take the arguments into consideration when launching the app, so it just fires the base '.exe' which is Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information. Actually, this is what I feared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do you know if this is a Windows or a browser (Chrome) in this case problem? This should be possible to do, but still, I'm not sure who needs to fix it for it to work, MS or the Browser developers.</p>
<p>

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />That is a Windows problem, because Windows does not have this functionality built in
<br />
<br />Please post this request to the Feedback Hub (Windows Key + F) over there the Microsoft Developers monitor that, and will hopefully see this as a function that needs adding to Windows 10, especially because most users are moving to online apps . . . hopefully they will take notice and implement this feature . . .

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>I did what you told me to. Gave this feedback on the Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft adds this feature in a new update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said, most users are moving to online apps. I never thought I would agree to that, but I do and I`m using a lot of Web Apps instead of native Apps. At least for apps that don`t need to have a good performance.</p>
<p>For simple apps is great.<br />
Medium is a good example. I enjoy reading on Medium but searched and haven`t found a Medium App for Windows, not on the store, not as a native&nbsp;32bit app. So I just went to the page a installed it as a web app. Problem solved. It`s just for reading, it doesn`t
 need to have a great performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope they see my Feedback and consider it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the information.</p>

    <title>Update History Incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megawattks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update History Incomplete</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to update my Windows 10 laptop in my office and verify it has the latest Quality Update that addresses Meltdown/Spectre.</p>
<p>Initially it was failing to get various Quality updates (including one back in Fall of 2017 and the 1/3/18 one I needed).
</p>
<p>But after some work by my IT folks, I think it _may_ have been fixed. </p>
<p>But I cannot reliably verify that for the following reason:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just installed a "Feature Update" today (1/13/18). Now, checking View Installed Update History in Settings&gt;Windows Update only shows that one entry - so I cannot tell if the associated 1/3/18 Quality Update was previously installed. It claims there are
 no new updates, but my another machine I have been working on would say the same thing when it did NOT yet have the needed 1/3/18 quality update that addresses Meltdown/Spectre (IT and I believe that was due to the virus protection program problem for those
 updates, which they have since fixed for me and that other machine properly shows me all the recent updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - how can I reliably confirm that the 1/3/18 Quality update that addresses Metldown/Spectre is installed?&nbsp; I do not trust the "everything's up to date" response from CheckForUpdates for the reasons above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; Is there a way to disable the deletion of update history? (a thread I read here suggested that occurs after a Feature update).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever you see in the report in your update list is reliable. With regard to the deletion of the update in the update history, there is no way that we can disable it. The reason behind it is because we want to make sure that once a new update is installed
 the old update will be replaced.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply and sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my machines have said that there were no new updates available, when there were important ones that it had (apparently) not done (according to its history listing). Please see original question again and the discussion threads about virus protection
 program compatibility issue preventing updates from occurring (e.g. kb4056892). My experience suggests that's what may have occurred, since it got the update I was seeking after our IT folks worked on it. However, I confess I don't have sufficient visibility
 into all of this. [For the record, that was on of my Win 7 desktop machine.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly my Win 10 home machine just did the Feature update yesterday and it still shows the Quality update history including the Jan 1, 2018 release installed on 1/3/18. Perhaps it is running a different flavor of Windows 10 and the one I was seeking
 is not applicable to the work laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow your advice and assume the updates are stable now.&nbsp; (Just saw a new quality one come in today :-)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Changing User Folder Name &#40;Windows10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently acquired a new rig with Windows 10. However, folks that first configurated the OS named my account wrong (they misspelled my name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing: I already pressed Windows + R -&gt; netplwiz -&gt; clicked on properties of my account -&gt; changed it's name to the correct one</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER: my " Users" folder is still misspelled, it's still with the old and wrong name. And I can't seem to be able to rename it. How do I do this in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>

            <p><em><strong>This is a well known bug in Windows 10, the username can be changed but the account folder cannot be re-named</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is fairly simple, rename your account to some other name, log out and log back in</p>
<p>Then create a new user account with your correct name, log out and log into the new account, transfer your files to your new account and delete the old (wrongly named) account and you are good to go!</p>

How can i add more apps to this list? For example "Microsoft News"<br />

<p><span>Hi Vitor Oliveira,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to see the application in Notifications &amp; actions, then that application might not support this setting and you can change the notification setting for a particular application
 within that application itself.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if you want to change the notification settings for Microsoft News, then you can launch
<strong>Microsoft News</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Settings</strong> (Gear icon) on the bottom left corner &gt; Change the notification settings for Microsoft News under
<strong>Notifications</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, some applications will appear here by default or once an application is installed if it is supported by Notifications and Actions Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For reference, you may refer
<strong><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028678/windows-10-change-notification-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Change notification settings in Windows 10</span></a></em></strong> and

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want any particular application to be added in this setting, then I suggest you to post your feedback in

<p>In the "Microsoft News" app I allowed notifications to be shown to me, but the app does not appear in the list under System&gt; Notifications and Actions.</p>

    <title>USB ports not recognizing hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honourboundpuppy  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB ports not recognizing hardware</h2>
                    I keep getting the notification "USB Device Not Recognized" when I plug in either of my iPods or my logitech webcam. My usb mouse and keyboard still work fine. I've tried multiple ports, tried to disable/uninstall the drivers for the unknown device, but
 nothing works. I even ran the scannow command in the Command screen while running as an Administrator and it came back with nothing wrong. Not sure what to do next. My ports were all working a few days ago, but now only two of my devices work. Any ideas?

<p>Hey ananemone,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Try slowing your burn speed. Some lower brands of DVDs function (write better) at slower speeds, especially at the end during finalizing (98.0-99.0%).</p>
<p>Additionally, check with other DVD brand. If this doesn't help,&nbsp;try burning the DVD by putting the system in clean boot state to determine if a third party application/software is interferring with the buring process.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clean boot process:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
Now that the system is in clean boot state, burn the DVD. If it goes successful, we know&nbsp;for sure that a&nbsp;third party application/startup item/service is conflicting with the burning process. Follow the process of elimination from the article below to figure
 out the culprit item.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><strong>
<br />
<br />
</strong>Ensure to return your computer to normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
1. &nbsp; Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
If there's no third party conflict, then it could be the problem with the driver or firmware updates.</p>
<p>Uninstall the driver currently being used by Windows and install the one from the Manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>To uninstall a driver:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Go to start orb and type device manager.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Device manager form the control panel list.<br />
3.&nbsp;Locate the graphics card device, right click on it and select properties.<br />
4.&nbsp;Go to driver tab and click on the uninstall button.<br />
5.&nbsp;Follow the on screen instruction.<br />
Once this is done, download the latest driver for your graphics card from the manufacturer’s website. You can obtain the manufacturer details from the device manager.</p>
<p>Recommended link for driver update:</p>

<p>For your DVD firmware updates, please contact the manufacturer for details.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but I already tried that, when I attempted to boot rec /rebuildbcd it says it's located 1 drive with an installation of windows on it and when I confirm &nbsp;by typing Y it's says the requested system device cannot be found. Im curious
 what can possibly cause the issues I'm having also if you know.

            <p>Actually I already figured out a solution to my problem, which is a bit much but I'll share anyway. I downloaded Windows 10 creation tool onto my USB, attempted to reinstall Windows, but I was getting an error "...cannot install on GPT drive..." even though
 my motherboard (MSI Z97-G45 gaming) is indeed UEFI compatible. So I then had to take out my ssd and install it into another computer and reformat it as a MBR drive, but it had an EFI partition on it that could not be deleted by regular means so I had to go
 into cmd and select the drive and then clean it using the clean command, which worked. I then reformatted it to a MBR drive, made a new simple volume and took it out and reinstalled it in my PC. When I attempted to reinstall windows though I was getting a
 different error "We couldn't create a new partition or locate an exiting one, see the Setup log files." So I did a bit of looking on google and found this solution here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2012/03/06/error-we-couldnt-create-a-new-partition-or-locate-an-existing-one-for-more-information-see-the-setup-log-files-when-you-try-to-install-windows-8-cp/</p>
<p>And this was the first thing that actually worked after about 8 hrs of non-stop BS searching and coming up with nothing. After I did the above I put my drive back in and Windows 10 was installing and everything is good. Still not sure why this happened to
 begin with, or why it wouldn't install windows on my GPT drive, if anybody knows please let me know.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>None of this information is helpful because I CAN'T LAUNCH THE WINDOWS 10 SYSTEM ... so how can I access any of these 'helps' to get it to launch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine a week ago. I tried to start the laptop this morning and the Windows 10 start up screen isn't there - it starts with the Toshiba message, goes to a blue Windows-type icon, then the screen goes black even though the machine is still
 running. Tried the diagnostic program (F2 and F12 accesses) but no joy there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the desktop to search for information. Nothing here tells me how to get into the computer to do the fix. Do I simply have to take it to a computer tech?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 works fine on my other laptop. This is frustrating.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open wma files in order to edit them</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I want to clip some audio (wma) files I recorded using my WMM (lectures), but WMM doesn't even give me the option of opening such files unless there is a video or photo already opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to open a wma file I get a message saying that this sort of file is not supported by WMM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using version 2011 with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I open and edit my files?</p>
<p>Isn't WMM meant to support wma files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>In the prior versions of Movie Maker (Windows Movie Maker 2.x and 6.0), you could create a movie with just audio.&nbsp; When it came time to save your "movie" it would create a .wma (audio) file.</p>
<p>In Windows Live Movie Maker, this capability is not present.&nbsp; The assumption is you are making a movie (with video) and therefore it requires you put some sort of visual element (photo or video) into your project first before you can add music.</p>
<p>If you think this would be a useful feature, you can suggest it at feedback.live.com.</p>
<p>Otherwise you have a few options, such as downloading the <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
prior version of Movie Maker</a>&nbsp;or getting a program specifically designed for editing audio files (Audacity is one such freeware program for audio editing).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned by considerate_guy, Windows Movie Maker (2.x and 6.0) has a feature that is not available in Windows Live Movie maker 2011.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the latest version (Windows Live Movie Maker 2011), it requires a photo/video before you can import a sound/audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you tried clearing your MAC address. 1) Settings 2)Network 3) Network settings 4) Advanced Settings 5) Alternate MAC address 6)Clear. Your system should restart on its own after this but if it doesn't go ahead and do a hard reset.

<p>
</p><p>Why can't you use this app with UAC disabled?&nbsp; UAC is fully disabled on my domain for many reasons, i don't want this thread going in the wrong direction about why its disabled it just is so leave it at that.&nbsp; UAC is not for everyone.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>So because we must have UAC disabled we can't even give feedback?&nbsp; The Settings app works without it so why can't others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the feedback app can't be made work without UAC then I need to know how you remove it before we give anyone 10 in our environment.&nbsp;

<p>

<h2>            How to access same file using two administrator account</h2>
                    <p>Can I have two admistrator accounts with the same files? I have several accounts now, but they don't contain the same files. Some of the files have backups but another account does not. If I switch accounts the files are not the same. Is this too confusing?
 I just don't know how to explain it better. I am using a&nbsp;Toshiba&nbsp;Laptop running windows 10.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes since an Administrator Account can access anything&nbsp;on the computer.<br />
Added files you place on OneDrive can be accessed from any account you<br />
authorize.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Cannot Complete Windows Experience Index Scoring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rifdhan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Complete Windows Experience Index Scoring</h2>
                    <p>I have tried several times, but I cannot get the Windows Expreience Index score for my PC. It runs the test and it looks to be working fine, then when it finishes, an error pops up saying (exactly):</p>
<p>"Cannot complete assessment. The assessment or other operation did not complete successfully. This is due to an error being reported from the operating system, driver, or other component."</p>
<p>Then the only option is 'Close', and the index doesn't display any results (all values are marked 'unrated').</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this score is not really important, but I still want to know why I can't score my system. It may indicate other issues.</p>
<p>By the way, all my drivers are up-to-date and my system functions completely normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,</p>

            <p>Hey, Lisa M.</p>
<p>I took a look at the threads you suggested, and found the first one of particular interest. It says to inspect the contents of the %SystemRoot%\Performance\WinSAT\winsat.log file. I did so and the following is the final log entry (all others are similar):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice the three lines I've bolded - they are all errors. I don't know what this means though. On the thread it's on (the first of the two you posted), they say it may the anti-virus software's fault (specifically Kaspersky), but I only have Microsoft Security
 Essentials installed on my PC. This (I hope) isn't a conflicting software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Rifdhan</p>

<p>Wenn der Fehler wieder auftritt würde ich trotzdem mal <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
die Hotline anrufen</a>. Der Anruf ist kostenlos, und wenn die Konsole nur knapp aus der Garantie draußen ist, macht der Support bei so Grenzfällen auch mal einen auf kulant.</p>

<p>Standard Garantie (freiwillig) von Microsoft ist nur ein Jahr. Lediglich bei den alten Konsolen gab es 3 Jahre erweiterte Garantie auf die 3 roten Leuchten und den E74 Fehler. Und wie gesagt, ein Anruf bei der Hotline kostet nichts. Wenn sie kulant sind,
 freu Dich. Wenn nicht, kannst Du immer noch dem kostenpflichtigen Austausch widersprechen und nichts passiert.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When exactly do you get the error message?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the complete and exact error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue might occur for several reasons like:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Low disk space in the primary system drive.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>A driver issue.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Video adapter problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods to resolve the issue:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><b>Step A:</b> Boot the computer in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Safe mode</b></a><b> </b>wherein the computer starts with basic drivers and no third party programs.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step B:</b></p>
<p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>clean boot</b></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the <b>
System Maintenance</b> troubleshooter:</p>
<p>a. Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Control panel</b></a>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <b>Troubleshooting</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click <b>View all</b> on the left pane of the screen.</p>
<p>d. In the list of options, click on <b>System Maintenance</b>.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Next</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the event viewer for details and post the information to assist you better.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of
<b>Start</b> menu and right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click or tap on <b>Event Viewer</b>.</p>

            I am in need of help with my tablet. &nbsp;Starting today, it is giving me the Kernel_Mode_Exception_not_handled error. &nbsp;It restarts twice and then goes to a recovery screen, but when I go to the See advanced repair options button, I am unable to select it
 or the restart my PC button. &nbsp;I don't have a keyboard attachment yet. &nbsp;Are you able to help me resolve this annoyance?

            I am having the same issue as well.&nbsp; How did you start your computer in safe mode when the blue screen pops up right away?

<h2>            Optical Drive &#40;CD&#47;DVD&#41; not detected by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I know this has been asked in the community many times already by others, and i have tried all of those fixes. Nothing works for me. My laptop is a new Lenovo e560. The cd/dvd drive is detected in the BIOS - can even boot with another bootable DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>LowerFilters &amp; UpperFilters strings removed from under registry key &nbsp;<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</strong> and rebooted the laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Added <strong>Controller0</strong> key under <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\</strong> and added a DWORD
<strong>EnumDevice1</strong> with value 1, and rebooted the laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Device Manager, clicked <strong>View-&gt;Show Hidden Objects</strong>, expanded the
<strong>DVD/CDROM Devices</strong>&nbsp;and uninstalled my DVD drive from the list. It never got detected or installed after a reboot - it's gone now, cannot see it anymore.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Device Manager, expanded <strong>IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers</strong>. But the only thing here is
<strong>Intel 6th Generation Core Processor Family Platform I/O SATA AHCI controller</strong>. There is nothing else there - no ATA Channel 0 or ATA Channel 1 (things that have been suggested to be deleted on other posts regarding this issue). So I uninstalled
 the SATA AHCI controller and rebooted. It just reinstalled it automatically. But no CD/DVD drive yet.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Device Manager, scanned for new hardware.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>And yes, I already ran the Hardware Troubleshooter.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten these above steps from the following posts:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><a href="http://www.askvg.com/optical-drives-are-not-showing-in-my-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.askvg.com/optical-drives-are-not-showing-in-my-computer/</a><br />
</li><li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-dvd-drive-missing/f246ef3d-ff9a-4cd2-9746-7de01184c258">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-dvd-drive-missing/f246ef3d-ff9a-4cd2-9746-7de01184c258</a><br />
</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Those helped a lot of people (try those first if you are having the same issue). But as you can guess none of those steps helped me, hence creation of this post.</p>

<p>I'm trying to launch Forza Horizon 4. Then it demands to sign in XBOX Live.</p>
<p>When I'm trying to connect it says "You have no network connection".</p>
<p>I play only this game. Problem started today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Yesterday I could launch the game but multiplayer wasn't active. Game said that I have restrictions with parental control but I haven't such thing.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My region is Russia. My network connection is alright so I write this message with my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to delete my Microsoft Account from laptop and sign in with XBOX Live again.</p>
<p>I read the article about troubles with connection to Live. No use.</p>
<p>Live services status is OK on your website.</p>
<p>Time settings is automated.</p>
<p>Nothing helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Andre were there any changes done to your hardware, firmware, or BIOS, before you did the reinstallation of Vista Ultimate?<br />
<br />
What steps did you take for reinstallation, was it a clean installation&nbsp;or upgrade?<br />
<br />
Whats your computer make and model number?<br />
You should be able to disable the power options icon on the taskbar through the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Right-click</span> your<span style="font-weight: bold"> Taskbar</span> (bar at the bottom of your screen), select
Notification Area</span> tab, then under<span style="font-weight: bold"> System icons</span>, uncheck the one that you wish to&nbsp;hide (<span style="font-weight: bold">Power</span>).</p>
