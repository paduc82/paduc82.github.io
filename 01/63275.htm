<h2>            Surface 3 LTE Broadcom GNSS 47531 driver crashes</h2>
                    Hello - Apologies for starting a new thread on this, as it has been discussed previously some while ago, but after many updates including the 1607 anniversary update and system firmware updates etc of 8/8/16 my S3 has been running reasonably reliably,
 except that the GNSS 47531 user-mode driver still crashes pretty much every time the system restarts, resulting in the GNSS sensor not working. This is logged in Event Viewer as critical error from DriverFrameworks-UserMode, Event ID 10111 "The device Broadcom
 GNSS 47531 Geolocation Sensor (location BcmGnssBus - GPS Function) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash...", plus various other associated error entries. It can be coaxed into running by disabling/re-enabling the driver in Device Manager, though it often
 takes two or three attempts. It then runs stably, including through sleep/wake and shutdown/switch-on cycles, until the next restart. Driver version is 20.23.8244.18. I wonder if anyone else is (still) seeing this sort of behav

            Hello John - Certainly sounds like the same issue! Just a couple of points that may be worth checking: (1) what version is your driver? Mine is 20.23.8244.18 (driver tab of the sensor properties); (2) you mention that your driver is crashing when you shut
 down and start up, whereas mine crashes only on restart. Is your system set&nbsp;for "fast start-up"? (Control Panel/Power Options/"Choose what the power buttons do"/"Turn on fast start-up (recommended)". It is on by default, but if by any chance it is off, then
 start up does a full re-boot, just&nbsp;like restart, rather than the resume from partial hibernate that is used in fast start-up. Turning off fast start-up makes the driver crash on shut down/start up for me, but as I say, it does survive a fast start-up.

<h2>            When I go to activate windows 10, there is no option to go to the store to buy an activation code</h2>
                    As the title states, there is a lack of a link to go to the windows store in order to buy a windows 10 activation code, and I don't exactly know how to fix this. If it helps i did try an older windows key (still win 10), but it turns out after some quick
 checking i had used it for a laptop.

            Hi Michael, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Let's try to head to the search/Cortana box (next to the Start menu) and type in a search for 'regedit'.
<br />
<br />This will run the Registry Editor. From here, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows, select the Personalisation key and select New before choosing DWORD (32-bit) Value.
<br />
<br />Select New Value #1 in the right-hand pane, and use F2 to rename it to the following:
<br />
<br />NoLockScreen
<br />
<br />Now double-click it, and change the value data to 1 and click OK.
<br />
<br />It's a slightly complex process, but after a reboot you should be able to automatically bypass the lock screen.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know, please. kinds Regards       
        </p>

<h2>            Startup Repair has been going on for hours</h2>
                    Hello. My HP laptop runs on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. It has a 300 GB hard drive.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During the last weeks I have experienced a lot of problems. First my computer started to slow down a lot. About 10 days ago when I attempted a reboot it brought up the check disk screen and then run the Startup Repair for about 1 hour. After that my computer
 could start but sometimes it was giving the check disk screen which was not detecting any problems. The computer was continuing to be very slow and not responding. I left it with the idea of re-installing Windows again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now last night I opened it because I wanted to take some files. It was being super slow again. Then I noticed that my antivirus Kaspersky was not starting. I thought this maybe was the cause of the problem so I uninstalled it and rebooted. Now the computer
 was working normally and responding very fast to my surprise. I thought I had fixed the problem. After some hours working with it I tried to open my browser but it got stuck. I pressed alt+ctrl+del but the screen for the task manager didn't come up and instead
 it told me to either cancel the command or it the computer was not starting to reboot it with the power button. Actually at this point my desktop froze so I rebooted with the power button. At startup the Startup repair screen came up but it didn't find any
 problem and then rebooted. Again it run the Startup Repair and again it didn't find any problems. This time I didn't press the restart button but went on the advanced options menu or something like that and applied a System Restore at an earlier point that
 day. After it finished the System restore windows restarted but the Startup Repair screen came up again trying to repair problems. It says the process could take over one hour, but now actually has been going on for about 8 hours. Is this normal? Should I
 let it run? or how much should I let it run, for how long?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My important files are on partition D while my system is on C. Should I just reinstall Windows, will this damage my files on D or not?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            Hi JR, in general, you will never need you Windows Product Key, it is embedded in your system. The main thing is your system has a digital Entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers . . 
<br />
<br />1. 
<br />
<br />If you need to re-install Windows 10:
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />If you do need your Product Key, your system would need to be running to get it . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key

            Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

Having the same issue with Surface 3 (not pro) since upgrading to Windows 10. Doesn't seem specifically linked to any program and haven't had issues with the pen, but after a random amount of time all touch input registers as a right-click, which basically
 makes it impossible to use. Restart resolves the issue for a bit, but keeps coming back. Had no issues with Windows 8.1</p>

I am having the exact same problem but I have a surface 3. I have tried shutting down restarting calibrating touch and the pen and nothing has helped. This makes using the surface extremely difficult</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having the exact same issue on Surface 3.</p>
<p>N-trig, a touchscreen solution which Surface is using,&nbsp;has a long standing issue that's been around for years&nbsp;related to weakness in dealing with electrostatic charges in and outside of the device.&nbsp;It usually shows up&nbsp;as touch acting up strangely, like in
 Surfaces' case,&nbsp;so I suspect the issue&nbsp;with Surface devices to be also caused by the same reason. Older N-trig drivers for other devices used to have a utility which users can run manually&nbsp;to make the device calibrate the touchscreen's electrostatic&nbsp;profile.
 Microsoft didn't include this utility on Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>You can solve the problem for a short time by wiping the screen with&nbsp;your palm to clean up any faulty touch&nbsp;registrations and irregular charged spots on the screen(but the problem returns in a very short time, like in a matter of seconds), and I think this
 supports my speculation of the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p>I am hoping Microsoft is aware of this issue and is already working on a driver or firmware update...</p>

<p>
</p><p>This reminds me that my TouchSmart which also had N-trig (DuoSense) would occasionally get spurious "taps" sensed.&nbsp; When it got bad enough I would disable the DuoSense driver for a while.&nbsp; This meant that Touch would not work but the pen would.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;surprisingly
 usable that way.&nbsp; Another thing I used to do, which I suppose is essentially similar to your "wiping the screen with your palm" workaround, was give it a work out with this:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the symptom being discussed sounds like one controlled by Pen and Touch Press and Hold Settings but I haven't seen it mentioned.&nbsp; (Maybe Surface 3 doesn't have it?)&nbsp; If so, what happens if you try making it impossible to "turn on that light bulb" using
 your finger?&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. make it such that the only right-click you can get is from your pen's barrel button. &nbsp;&lt;eg&gt;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Wow.&nbsp; Synchronicity.&nbsp; For another issue I took my Surface Pro off its dock and started using it on battery only.&nbsp; This "spurious taps" issue started happening to me with the battery level at over 50%!&nbsp; I had to disable the Touch screen to get anything done
 without interruptions.&nbsp; Fortunately, as I mentioned with my TouchSmart experience, disabling the Touch Screen still leaves us with the Pen for an input device and that works OK.&nbsp; But for yet another issue I had disabled the
<em>Press and hold</em> for right-click emulation, so now my pen's barrel button is getting a workout too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it's not just Surface 3 that is being affected by W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do your symptoms change if you plug in the charger?</p>

            I don't often use it on the charger, but I'll give that a shot when I have a chance to see if anything changes. Summer classes are over so I haven't been using it as much. I should get my replacement pen in the mail soon and I'll see if that changes the
 issue at all, as well. I'll try to report back within the next few days.

            Hi John, honestly to get the best possible performance form that NVMe drive your best option is to clean install Windows 10. While cloning a disc can be time saving and handy, it rarely results in a responsive or stable system . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<p>Hi DAve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried your suggestion and I can access the USB installation options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it to installing on the NVMe drive and I get there isn't a partition there and/or not enough space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<br />
<br />Can you please take a photo of that screen showing the partitions on that NVMe drive and I will have a look for you . . .

                    <p>Please can i get a solution for this problem. This comes up whenever I try to access any of the settings on the system. Several of the icons on the taskbar no longer seem to be working as well, like the volume, network, power, search, store and start buttons.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if this is an update problem or not, it just seemed to occur. Have tried sfc /scannow several times and it sees errors but cannot correct them.</p>

                    I received the notification to upgrade to Windows 10 for my Windows 7 desktop and clicked the "OK to continue" button and the only thing that happens is a get a "Working on it..." message and spinning circle above the message. It has been running now for
 over 8 hours and no progress. Is this the way it is supposed to work? If not, then how do I get past this point?

            <p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>I am having the same issue, over 20 hrs.&nbsp; I can't afford to turn my desktop into a brick, nor do I have the time to fix it.&nbsp; do I cancel and live with windows 7 or what.&nbsp; This site is full of these very same questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says my upgrade is ready</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me the 'what to expect' screen </p>
<p>
</p><p>goes away for hours and hours and hours with spinning dots that says 'Working on it...'</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you aren't getting the sense that there are a lot of worried and frustrated people please assume so now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get past this?&nbsp; Do I stop it and continue with 7 until you and it mature?</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set it to download and had "Working on it..." running for 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to switch off and move my desktop to ethernet directly into my fibre optic and off the wireless connection - a mission in itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted and it now says "Download Complete"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the install and it just goes back to "Working on it..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should we as your customers do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got no error messages and no informative progress message.</p>
<p>If there's something that is stopping it install it would be useful to know what so I can resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirty years in software development and I've drummed it into my teams over the years - always provide informative progress messages and error messages so diagnostic support can be provided.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok as noted in one of my 'very same' replies to this no status "working on it" nonsense. I followed the advice of a few posters and went into the settings and into the windows updat part and had it check for updates. Windows 10 was preloaded in the drop
 down and I clicked on it and away the installation went</p>
<p>
</p><p>it finished reasonably quickly&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this year, i ended up getting a refurbished HP running with Intel(r) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @ 3.10GHz, 8.00 GB of RAM running Windows 10. I had originally wanted a 7 due to its user-friendly nature but I had no choice but to stick with the 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywho, on Saturday, I couldn't take it anymore so I downloaded Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit &amp; burned it to a cruzer flash card. Yesterday, I decided to install Windows 7 but upon completion, I have been having monitor issues as everything appears scrunched
 up &amp; when I go to settings, it says I'm using a Generic PnP Monitor (mine is a BenQ). Also, I cannot get onto the internet with it so I'm using a tablet to write this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the company who refurbished it &amp; they said that I would need to let Microsoft downgrade for me in the case of refurbished computers. Is this true &amp; that I've done something I shouldn't have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have folders containing the remnants of my time using Windows 10 called "Windows.Old" &amp; "Windows.Old.000" but is there anyway to retrieve them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, somebody get back to me as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. My refurbished computer never came with CDs to reformat.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downgrading to Windows 7 from Windows 10 is a process which requires a clean install. Based from the information that you've shared, it seems that the drivers are missing on the device. If you wanted to continue with Windows 7, you need to check the drivers
 on your system. You can open<strong> Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Hardware and Sound
</strong>&gt;<strong> Device Manager</strong> to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no drivers in the Device Manager, you need to download it on the drivers' website. Once done, check if you're still getting the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Do you want to install Windows 10 or get Windows 7 up and running?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you want to re-install Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p><span>Click&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)">HERE</span></a><span>&nbsp;to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can
 download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>If you want to get Windows 7 up and running:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It sounds like you just need a few drivers . . .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For each driver that has not loaded:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Device Manager (Accessible by right clicking your Start Menu)</span></li><li><span>Expand the Display Adapters section, right click the display adapter, choose properties</span></li><li><span>On the Details Tab, change the Property Drop Down to Hardware Id's</span></li><li><span>Right click the first line in the list, choose 'Copy'</span></li><li><span>Then paste that into google and it will tell you what the device is (for example: intel HD Graphics 3000)</span></li><li><span>Then go to the relevant website, download the Windows 7 driver for that device and install it</span></li></ol>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>From your description above, you need at least a Display Adapter (graphics card) Driver to get your monitor up and running (not a monitor driver) and a Wifi or Network Driver to get your Internet up and running . . .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and exact model of your system, we may be able to guide you towards the correct drivers!</p>

            If you want to try to upgrade to Windows 10, you will need to download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I did what you told me with the windows.old folder &amp; it now picks up the BenQ monitor (it's a BenQ G2410HD). However, everytime I boot up, my resolution still comes out cramped forcing me to manually switch to a proper resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I still have no access to the internet but it says I need a network adapter &amp; to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I forgot to mention: only the recycle bin icon appears on the desktop.</p>

<p>Did you use the same scan for drivers for the other devices listed in Device Manager with an exclamation? It would eventually pick up drivers for other components like your network adapter from the Windows.old folder, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you could then do is check Windows Update for additional drivers. Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try Daves link - although the page is experiencing some difficulties opening here. Download the essential drivers for the latest version of Windows listed there such as: chipset, display, network, save them to a thumb drive then install on the

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Windows 10 Pro OEM Key Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I've bought a Windows 10 Pro OEM key like 6 months ago which was fine when I first installed it but yesterday I clean installed Windows 10 again on the same computer with exact same hardware, and it shows that it is Single Language? Is this
 a bug or what cause I can't seem to find any answers online, if not what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: For the people who are having the same problem, follow the instructions Andre provides. That fixed it for me after a reboot.</p>

            Hi Berker
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Single Language simply means, you can't install language packs, regardless its OEM or Retail.
<br />
<br />But since you indicated you originally had Windows 10 Pro, use this method to go back to Pro.
<br />
<br />Try using this key instead, but do this first, disconnect from the Internet. Press Windows key + A then toggle on airplane mode. Proceed to enter the key.
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro using the following default product key:
<br />
<br />VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T
<br />
<br />Review instructions how to perform an Easy Upgrade using the default key:

<br />
<br />After upgrading, proceed to enter the Windows10 Pro product key you bought.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate

                    It gets to the loading screen, but there's no windows logo - just the loading bar....and it doesn't get past that. Then, when I tried to install a different OS (XP pro, the only boot disc I have), as soon as it launches into "Starting Windows..." I get
 blue-screened. I tried a different hard drive, and got the same result. Is there any way to fix this?

<p>To obtain the Acer&nbsp;Recovery DVD, there is a &nbsp;link in my 1st reply.</p>

<p>On Acer, you may&nbsp;press Alt + F10&nbsp; at Startup to start the recovery process.</p>

<h2>            Downloadable Content &#40;Map Packs&#41; Gears of War 2</h2>
                    
<p><span>I recently downloaded the map packs off Gears of War 2 but the Play now button is grayed out. . .I've had the xbox awhile but never really explored other options, such as downloadable content..etc, Is there a reason that this
 is not an option for me? I am a free member and I thought it was possible to need a subscription to xbox live to play these map packs, all I'm really looking for is a solution or confirmation that my assumption about needing an xbox live membership is accurate!
 Any advice on the issue/matter will be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>I don't see Gears of War 2 in your game history. To play any DLC, you will need to full game (retail disk or downloaded version) in order to play it. You do not require a gold subscription to play the maps on your XBox, but you will need a gold subscription
 if you want to play multiplayer online.</p>

    <title>Mouse selection bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toxicmushroom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse selection bug</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I have this bug for a while now because I hoped an update would fix it but I can't find other users with the same problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47418565-f0fd-4b5d-a220-4cec39ab8d2a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47418565-f0fd-4b5d-a220-4cec39ab8d2a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>So that's the problem ^ (I experience this in almost all programs like WinRAR, FileZilla, WinSCP&nbsp;and my desktop)<br />
This is what it should be (in explorer it still works normally)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/421d6509-7191-4723-9528-67aa4f4ded69?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/421d6509-7191-4723-9528-67aa4f4ded69?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Now you might&nbsp;think that this isn't a big deal.&nbsp;<br />
The real issue here is that the outline flickers and when used in a GUI&nbsp;like FileZilla&nbsp;has a horizontal scrollbar my mouse jumps to the right bottom corner which is really annoying. I didn't have this issue before the selection bug.<br />

<p>Hi ToxicMushroom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conflicts with a third-party program is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues using your mouse. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the
<strong>Windows </strong>key, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press the <strong>
Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest that you try running your computer in clean boot and check if it helps. Performing this helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. You can follow
 the steps in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
Note: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward to your reply.</p>

            We appreciate you reply. Since the issue persists after running your computer in clean boot, I would suggest that you try to perform a repair upgrade. Performing a repair upgrade can resolve broken operating system files while preserving your personal
 files, settings and installed applications. You can follow the steps in this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">

    <title>After a windows 10 update my audio drivers are not recognized. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After a windows 10 update my audio drivers are not recognized.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>Last night, my computer said it had been scheduled for updates and prompted me to restart my computer, so I did. The update took quite awhile, almost like I was reinstalling windows 10 altogether. Everything was working fine until I did a restart because
 things began to run very slow, then I tried to plug in my earbuds(the ones you get with apple products) and the usual message box asking me what kind of device it was, didn't show up but sound was still coming out of my speakers. I went into the playback devices
 and disabled the device to see if a restart would help, and the device disappeared from the list. I assumed that because of the update, my drivers weren't installed correctly. I went into device manager and tried to update the drivers. My AMD High Definition
 Audio device updated fine, but when I tried to update the Realtek HD audio device, an error occurred while installing that read "data error (cyclic redundancy check)" I visited the Realtek website to get the drivers manually from there and the installation
 again FAILED with a 0x00000017 error. I checked my Windows Update and the driver is listed there, but when it begins "preparing to install updates", ANOTHER error comes up: "Error 0x80070017" I have tried everything from doing a chkdsk and finding no issues
 to looking up forums online that provide NO HELP relating to my issue.. I'm just hoping that someone can help me with this. I've been looking for a solution since last night and have found nothing. It's becoming very frustrating. Please help!!!!</p>

    <title>Duplicate Entries In Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jantacci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Entries In Device Manager</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
<br />
I just looked at Device Manager on my Windows 8.1 Pro desktop PC and when showed hidden devices I noticed that I have several duplicate entries for the same hardware. Here is a screenshot:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71af49ec-e51f-4b78-bac6-e42764f5a9e0" /><br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of that might have caused this was that I just did a clean install of Windows. When the installation was complete I then installed all the drivers that came with my MSI motherboard and some of these drivers were the same and so Windows
 makes a copy and adds -1, 2, etc. to the name? If the drivers were duplicated why wouldn't Windows just overwrite the old one instead of copying it? Seems to me that would just fill up the registry with excess entries.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me why these are there and if it's safe to remove the ones that are hidden? More generally, is it safe to remove hidden devices (duplicates or not)?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

</p><p>The darker gray ones are connected the lighter gray ones are not.&nbsp; They can be created when for example you plug a device like a headphone into a different plug (especially true if USB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you remove a needed one the next time you plug the device in the worst that can happen is that windows will install a fresh copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know why you feel you need to remove them.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />After doing some research on your CPU, it seems that Windows 10 can be installed on your hardware, but you won't be able to install the most recent updates from around March 2018 onward.
<br />
<br />Here is a link to get you started with Windows 10 installation. You may need to purchase a license for your tablet if it doesn't already have one.
<br />

<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need any more help. Thanks!

<p>Some more information such as the name of the game and the brand and model graphics processor could be helpful</p>
<p>as some games will show this sort of error if the machine does not meet a games minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>- The DirectX versions your <em>graphics processor</em> is capable of using is shown in dxdiag &gt; Display tab &gt;
<em>Feature Levels.</em></p>
<p><em>- </em>The DirectX Version shown under the <em>System</em> tab is useless. This only shows the highest level of DX
<em>Win10 </em>can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(copy/paste from a post I made on the topic&nbsp; yesterday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> to verify if all DirectX files are installed on your Win10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Win10 has DX9,10,11 and 12. Very few games use DX12 at this point. Windows does not determine what version,
</p>
<p>or which DirectX file gets used, the game does. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Old games are limited to using DX9 (even older games use only DX7 or DX8).</p>
<p>- More modern games (since Vista &amp; Win7)&nbsp; use both DX9 and 10 or 11. This allows the games to run on lower spec,
</p>
<p>and older systems that don't have the power or capability (the graphics processor has to be capable of using
</p>
<p>the version of DX in question) to use DX10/11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A number of recent games are restricted to DX10 or 11 and have no option for DX9. I'm not certain if any of the

<p>few DX12 titles have a DX9 option.</p>
<p>- Some games have a DX10/11 option in the games setup, but others use the DX10/11 files automatically when the user</p>
<p>selects Very High or Ultra settings. If the graphics processor is not capable of using a particular version of DX</p>
<p>the relevant graphics settings is normally greyed out in the game graphics setup.</p>

<h3> patrickbcunningham  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN 10 will not install. Windows Update error 0x80070003 or 80070003 keeps appearing.</h2>
                    <p>Have attempted 7 times now to download and install WIN 10 to no avail. Each time it downloads and begins installation but when finished it says unable to complete installation error code 0x80070003. I have ran windows troubleshooter on each occasion to fix
 errors. (3 keep showing up as now fixed) and I then try again to install/update to WIN 10 but it still says the same error.</p>
<p>Anybody have any help/information that will be of use to me?</p>

            I also have tried this and lots of other "solutions" and nothing works. Same problem as RamKumar every update from 8.1 to 10.

<h2>            Windows 7-Windows Media Player 12-cannot add back deleted files</h2>
                    I just got a new computer with Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows Media Player 12 (I assume) pre-installed.&nbsp; I know all about managing libraries and how to add my files from different locations, but in previous version of WMP there was a check box to allow
 you to allow previously deleted files back into the library.&nbsp; WMP 12 doesn't seem to have this option and I am trying to figure out how to get deleted files back into my library.&nbsp; I have music in my library from my external hard drive and well as pictures
 and videos.&nbsp; Well, I deleted the videos from the library only and now I want to add them back.&nbsp; I removed that folder and readded it, but after the indexing procedure, the movies were not back in the library.&nbsp; How do I get it to readd files previously deleted
 from the library that were not necessarily deleted from the computer.&nbsp; I don't want to have to move all the files or rename their existing folders just to get them back into the library.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
In Windows 7 this option is moved to a different location. Here are the steps to locate it.<br />
a. Launch Windows Media Player.<br />
b. Go to Tools and then Advanced.<br />
c. Now click on Restore deleted library items.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2.</strong> <br />
If the above steps do not help you may need to rebuild the Windows Media player database.<br />
Here is how:<br />
To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note:</strong> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Add items to the Windows Media Player Library<br />

Hope this helps.</p>
