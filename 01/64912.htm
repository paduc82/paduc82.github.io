    <title>Question about this whole Cable&#47;Satellite thing.... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Question about this whole Cable&#47;Satellite thing....</h2>
                    
<p>So when I heard you need cable to watch Xbox TV, I thought, "just another nail in the coffin for me", then I read you could also use a satellite box. Heres my question then, and I will try my best to explain it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;My family uses Direct TV. At the time we got it, about maybe 3-4 yrs ago+ (we've had it before at another house), we only got one satellite box, and were told if I wanted one in my room it would be extra (Ok, I understand that, that's fine), We were also
 told that if each box/tv wanted to watch something different, we would need more than one dish. They told us that two different boxes running off of one dish would only play whatever the one box was watching on both boxes. So I wouldn't be able to watch something
 different than what my parents were, in my room. So heres my question. If this still holds true today, how would this work, or would it even work, on a xbox one? Would I still be restricted to only what my parents were watching on their box downstairs through
 the xbox one in my room, or would the xbox one work around that seeing as they have their own TV service, and using the satellite connection? I guess all in all I'm asking how would this even work?</p>

<p>You still need a Satelite decoder. the Xbox one apparently acts as a through box for the decoded signal. Also the box they were selling your was a signal sender box and receiver not actually a proper box as such by the sound of it. You can in theory split
 the signal from a dish if as I'm guessing it using standard coaxial cable, you would have to split the encoded signal and send that to your box in your room where it decodes the signal separately. The problem is this can mess with the signal strength so you
 might find the picture quality not as good or to have issues sometimes.</p>

<p>Yeah it was a receiver, I couldn't remember the name at the time. So then, I would need to buy a satellite decoder for the xbox One? Sorry, I'm not to familiar with the whole system too much. I mean I understand the whole dish to receiver with the card inserted
 into the receiver, but as for other receivers off one dish and all its confusing... So that means I would still need to "split the signal" or get another dish even if I used the xbox with the satellite tv if I wanted to watch something different?</p>

<p>Well you shouldn't in theory need another dish. Its the same Signal its just being split. You can do it with regular TV signal from an aerial pretty easily.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'd need to split the signal, I'm guessing the bit that plugs into the decoder box from the Aerial can come away and is a standard signal bearing cable called a Coxial cable.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you'd need to do would be get a splitter for the cable and run another cable to your room. To view the satelite TV in your room you would need a second decoder box.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence you're taking the signal from the dish and splitting it two ways to two separate decoders. Then for it to work with Xbox One you'd have the HDMI out from the Decoder in your room hooked into the Xbox One &nbsp;then you could view it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Short the Xbox One will do nothing for you really as you can achieve the same if you can get a Second decoder and second card for it to decode the Satelite anyway, as you'll need both of those anyway to use the Xbox one.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short no you wouldn't need another dish in theory yes you would need a second Decoder. The way it works is the Dish at present gets all the channels and signal at once it doesn't filter them out, then the decoder interprets the signal and plays your selection
 (the channel). By splitting the signal before the decoder, you should how two separate streams of the same signal so a second decoder could decode that second signal and let you watch any channel.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason you got told you'd have to watch the same channel is because how they wanted to do it was send the signal from the decoder downstairs to your room however as the decoder downstairs only transmits to the TV the signal thats required for the channel
 selected then that's why you'd have to watch the same channel.</p>

<p>Xbox1 will not do anything as far as letting you watch satellite. You need a coax cable to it's own LAN on the dish on one end and a receiver hooked to your tv on the other to watch satellite. If you have that setup, you can then add xbox1 between the receiver
 and the tv, but you'll still have to change channels on the receiver as X1 will only be able to display the channel the receiver is on.
</p>
<p>So, in short X1's tv capabilities are worthless if you have satellite. &nbsp;Ditto if you have cable that requires a cable box. It will only worked as shown on the reveal if you have air reception or a basic cable (no cable box) signal. My guess is what MS really
 did this for was to try and sell subscriptions to some over the internet tv service where their box will act as the receiver for that streaming tv service.</p>

<p>Xbox One controls cable boxes and other devices using either HDMI-CEC or an IR blaster. It has no integrated tuner of its own. It'll be able to change channels on the receiver. How it handles a cable DVR is yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>You don't need multiple dishes to watch different channels. If you have a 3 LNB dish, they should've ran 4 lines from it to the house. You need an individual line for each receiver (2 for DVRs). If you had 1 receiver &amp; ran coax out from it to another tv,
 then you can only watch the same channel. Xbox One will allow you to run hdmi from the receiver/cable box into the Xbox to display your content through the Xbox.</p>

<p>Well in essence the tv portion of Xbox One will be pretty worthless for me then, seeing as I won't be splitting any cables because I won't be running a cable from the tv downstairs, up the steps to the second floor and into my room. It would be too much
 time and money probably just to run it throught the ceiling, through a couple walls into the corner of my room. So I guess in essence for me, this is really one more "nail in the coffin" for the One for me...</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it would be worthless anyway with satellite, seeing as I can just watc shows on all those channels anyways, and it would probably be close to the same on the One...</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification guys</p>

<p>[quote user="BaltRavensFan20"]Well in essence the tv portion of Xbox One will be pretty worthless for me then[/quote]You should think of it as the video portion of the device. The ability to switch between game and video, or put something alongside game,
 does not require an HDMI video input source.[quote]I can just watc shows on all those channels anyways, and it would probably be close to the same on the One...[/quote]The point of having the Xbox One in-line with your TV source is for the enhanced guide and
 switch abilities. If you don't want those, there's no need to run your video through it.</p>

<p>I could use the Guide on Direct TV just fine, I don't need to know what is popular or who of my friends is watching what.</p>
<p>Really, the only thing I care about right now is the games, the TV stuff to me is just an added bonus I wouldn't really use that much. As it is now for the 360, I hardly use any of the music or video sections. For me, my all in one device is my smart phone,
 I can already play games, music, video, surf the web on it, why do I need another all in one device, you know? I also use ultrabook (which has windows 8 anyway)&nbsp;I have for surfing the web and such, watching you tube, music, etc. I also need the ultrabook for
 autocad and stuff like that, so the convenience of the all in one thing for everything wouldn't be so convenient for me.</p>
<p>That's why I said, this system is looking more and more worthless for me to buy. For someone focused more on the games and hardware like me, it just wouldn't be worth it. Its sad, because I'd like to have the system for the IPs and such, but the thing for
 me now, is balancing the worth (basically what games they will have) with the cost, and if the cost is more than the worth, I'm sorry to say Microsoft won't be getting my money this time around. I just wish they would have balanced the whole TV vs games a
 little better than they did this time around.</p>

<p>Really? Because&nbsp;I never saw that on the reveal, but then&nbsp;I watched it on xbox 360 and apparently they had better coverage on Spike tv, go figure. I really fail to see how X1 can interface with all the myrid cable and satelight boxs. Not to mention if that
 is how it works, it's even more pointless than i thought. What would be the point of me using my phone to text my roomate sitting next to me and telling him to pick up the remote between us and change the channel instead of simply picking it up and doing it
 myself? None. Just like there'd be no point in telling the X1 to do it instead of doing it directly on the cable box myself. Except this way I'm running the X1 all the time for no reason cutting its lifespan and probably letting MS track my tv usage.</p>

    <title>How to disable the close program prompt when restarting or shutting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable the close program prompt when restarting or shutting down PC&#63;</h2>
                    This is not the first time I wake up in the morning, turned on my monitor and noticed my pc was never shut down, it stuck at the screen where it ask you to close blahblah programs(sometimes nothing is even listed), or force a shut down.
<br />
<br />
I understand this is to protect us from accidental loss of data, but really? We've all been trained under windows for so many years and WHAT WE LEARNED even in the win95 era is to SAVE SAVE SAVE your progress... SO WHY NOW? Vista has this feature but my old
 vista machine never get stuck at the shutdown screen. One big gripe I have with windows is the features that sound good on paper, but they are implemented so poorly and never quite work out in the real world. Example: WIN+TAB preview in vista, how many of
 you actually use that? and this prompt before I want to shut down my pc, all I want is to shut down the pc, not the pc telling me oh I should close this and that because when I press shut down, I expect the pc to shut down and not pretending being smart!<br />
<br />
Sorry I have to vent, but this is getting annoying, how can I disable this feature?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

    <title>Loss of battery percentage status icon on task bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariaeames  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of battery percentage status icon on task bar</h2>
                    <p>HI. I have a Lenovo laptop and am operating on windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an update I was offered a new icon that literally shows the battery life percentage and opted to have that icon on my task bar. Yesterday I booted up my computer and watched all my icons appear and then the battery icon just disappeared. I open up
 the up arrow box and it was not there either. How do I retrieve it? It was very helpful as I keep my laptop plugged in mostly so I can readily see how my battery is operating.</p>

            HI Maria.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you check your Windows Update history at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update&gt;Installed Updates to see what Update or Driver was installed that might have offered this Battery icon?  It could be something like Energy management, probably from the PC maker.  If you find it then use the Uninstall link there to try to uninstall it.
<br />
<br />Or did you receive an Update from the PC maker directly and not Windows Update?  If so then it will be a driver on the PC's Support Downloads webpage you should be able to uninstall in Device Manager and/or at Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Then you can either try reinstalling the Update or hide it using the Hide Update tool from here:    <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of that helps you can try a System Restore to before the problem happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Then use the Hide Updates tool to check for Updates and hide the one which appears to offer this feature.  
<br />
<br />If nothing helps this far then we'll need to do more research.  What is the PC's make and full model number?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Open device manager by typing in devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box.<br />Expand Batteries. <br />Right click each of the two devices one by one and click Uninstall. (One of that would be MS API compliant battery, second I do not remember the name)<br />Restart the computer and icon should be back again.

    <title>Application Does Not Start in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcpro178  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application Does Not Start in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed a new 60GB SSD as my primary hard drive and re-installed Windows 7 Professional 64-bit. I then installed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.abelssoft.net/ssdfresh.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SSD Fresh from Abelssoft</a>&nbsp;to optimize Windows to run on the SSD.
 It seemed to install okay, but when I try to run the utility, its splash screen appears briefly before it quietly closes. No errors are displayed; the utility just fails to launch. I have run SSD Fresh on another SSD-equipped Windows 7 Pro x64 computer in
 the past without any problems.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what might be preventing the program from running? &nbsp;I tried running `sfc /scannow` from the command line (with administrator privileges), shutting down the Spybot Resident, and disabling the firewall and virus scanner. &nbsp;I also tried running
 the tool as administrator; I even tried reinstalling it, running the installer as administrator. &nbsp;No luck.</p>
<p>Every time I try to launch the program the Event Viewer logs this same set of errors:</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Bluetooth Disappearing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo YOGA laptop and kept losing the Bluetooth functionality. When opening up the tab that usually includes all settings, it simply does not appear. I also spent lots of time researching this issue and have tried restarting, updating drivers and
 the such. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I decided to just try resetting my PC but the same problem still exists. When running the Bluetooth troubleshooter it just says that Bluetooth is not installed. I went into Device Manager to try and update drivers but it just said that the newest updates
 were already in place and I have already turned all the Bluetooth-related Services onto Automatic. Finally, I decided to uninstall the Qualcomm Bluetooth driver I had since I thought it would reinstall when I used Windows Update but it has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone understands what is going on with this issue I would really appreciate any help.</p>

<br />Its possible you might need to apply an available BIOS and chipset driver update to resolve the problem.

<p>Hey there. I believe that going through with these updates should still be beneficial but I wanted to let you know that I just downloaded some Bluetooth drivers from Lenovo and the Bluetooth button reappeared in both my right tab on the taskbar and in the
 device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you could direct me to pages where these downloads came from since I don't really want to run those .exe's without seeing their origin and what they will be doing to my computer.</p>

            I just ran the last two updates but could not run the first one since I do not have my charging cord on hand. I really appreciate your help with this problem and was just wondering if there were any other steps you think I should take to make sure that
 the Bluetooth doesn't disappear again later.

            Well, you can create a system restore point now, just in case it happens again, you can restore back to that earlier point. 
<br />
<br />Don't install any new hardware driver updates from Windows Update.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25d8c9af-cf15-4720-aeb2-502fb37561d8?upload=true" />

            Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.

            Hey, sorry to bother you again after so long but Bluetooth has once again disappeared from my right settings tab and has become a hidden device in Device Manager. I have not yet done a system restore or redownloaded Bluetooth drivers but was wondering
 if you knew what potential causes of this issue could be.

    <title>How do i authorize administrators on other computers on my home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papa danno  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i authorize administrators on other computers on my home network to make changes on this computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a home network on which two computers (A &amp; B) are configured, both running the latest version of Windows 10. I normally (on those rare occasions when things are working properly) can access one computer from the other and perform any administrative
 functions that I need to do. However, every time the Microsoft Help Desk decides it needs to reinstall Windows 10 on either computer, I suddenly can no longer access the other computer on my network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this recently occurred, I had to have the Help Desk remotely dial in to both computers simultaneously and fix a setting just so each computer could see the other computer. However, although I can see computer (A) on the network from computer (B) --
 the one that was just reinstalled -- I no longer have administrator authority to make changes on computer (A) from computer (B). It works fine in the other direction -- i.e., administrators on computer (A) can see, access, and make changes on computer (B).
 But, although administrators on computer (B) can see and access computer (A), they have no authority to rename or move or delete files or folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to add the administrators from computer (B) to the security authorization tab under the properties for a main folder on computer (A), but it would not allow me to add anyone from a different computer. So, when I access computer (A) from computer
 (B) and try to perform any administrative task, the message says that I need the approval of the Administrator to do so. Well, who is this mysterious Administrator. I thought I was. The security and authorizations on computers running Windows 10 (and a few
 previous versions) is ridiculous and counterproductive. Administrators are administrators and should be able to perform administrative functions on any computer on the network. (It is so stupid that, whenever Windows is reinstalled, I have to go through exhausting
 and time-consuming gyrations just so I, as the local administrator, can access folders on my computer, something that should be automatic for administrators. And once I do, I am often locked out from performing administrator tasks without the permission of
 the mysterious Administrator.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me configure both computers so that administrators from either one can perform administrator functions on the other?</p>

            The permissions for the local administrators is set to full rights. This works fine on the local machine. The problem is that, although the administrators on the second computer (which have the same user account names) have full permissions, the system
 will not recognize the administrators from the first computer and seems to lump them in with Everyone. And the system will not allow me to grant any permissions to anyone on another computer--I can only set permissions for user accounts on the local machine.

<p>Your problem is easily solved: If you use an account on both PCs that meets these conditions then you can perform all your administrative tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identical account name</li><li>Identical password</li><li>Admin level for both accounts</li></ul>
<p>If you still face recstrictions then you need to check these items on both PCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Full Access for Everyone" to the shares you created.</li><li>"Full Access for Everyone" to the folders themselves.</li></ul>

<blockquote>Your problem is easily solved: If you use an account on both PCs that meets these conditions then you can perform all your administrative tasks:<br />
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Identical account name</li><li>Identical password</li><li>Admin level for both accounts</li></ul>
<p>If you still face recstrictions then you need to check these items on both PCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Full Access for Everyone" to the shares you created.</li><li>"Full Access for Everyone" to the folders themselves.</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>First, I cannot give Everyone full access because I need to protect the contents from accidental changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, as I have said before, the user accounts on both computers are identical and the access rights are identical. The two administrator accounts (my wife and myself) are both Microsoft Accounts. My sons use local accounts on both machines.</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

</p><p>I tried to run a c++ code on the surface pro 4 with visual studio 2013 using opencv 3.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After following the instruction in the opencv 3.0 document to install (The linker, include files, libraries, and so on), I ran the code as shown below. The compiler have no errors but the image spend almost more than 2 minutes to show a image (both debug

------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>* checked the libraries are in the right path.</p>
<p>* checked the install instructions as opencv document said to set the "Path" and so on.</p>
<p>* checked whether the cvLoadImage did load the image in the parameter Image1--&gt; It &nbsp;does.</p>
<p>* checked if I use Mat type and function imshow had the same problem --&gt; yes</p>
<p>* checked opencv 3.0 matches visual studio 2013 (there are success install cases from the internet)</p>
<p>* My surface pro 4 works almost perfectly, I even tried to play online games (such as LOL) on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone had the same problem like this? Please help.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Miguel,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description provided it looks like when you try to open an application or a program Windows Media Center opens up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try these recommended steps which should help you to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A default program is the program that </span><span>Windows</span> uses when you open a particular type of file, such as a music file, an image, or a webpage. For example, if you have more than one web browser installed on your computer, you can choose
 one of them to be the default browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Change which programs </span><span>Windows</span> uses by default</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Set Program Access and Computer Defaults, you can specify the default programs that
</span><span>Windows</span> uses for common activities such as browsing the web and sending e‑mail. You can also specify which programs are available from the Start menu, the desktop, and other locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Run a virus scanner and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Virus is known to cause these issues. Scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which helps to get rid of virus, spyware, and malicious software.</span></p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">h<span>ttp://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to create a new user profile and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Fix a corrupted user profile</span></b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please perform these recommended steps, revert if you still experience the issue. I will be glad to provide you with additional options available that you can utilize to get this resolved.</span></p>

<p><span>When installing Windows on UEFI-based PCs using Windows Setup, your hard drive partition style must be set up to support either UEFI mode or legacy BIOS-compatibility mode. With that, I highly suggest that you contact your device manufacturer
 to provide you the appropriate steps on how to install Windows on your hard drive.

<p>(1) Did you make the Win 10 Installation Media here...?...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>Download Windows 10 - version 1709 currently</p>
<p>
</p><p>That one will be <strong>capable </strong>to boot in UEFI mode (as well as Legacy MBR mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Ensure you made it to match the computer's <strong>architecture </strong>(64-bit or 32-bit),
<strong>Edition </strong>(Home, Pro, etc.) &amp; <strong>language</strong>, as the article says. If yours is a UEFI machine, it must be
<strong>64-bit</strong> capable, &amp; that is the one to choose. (32-bit cannot be UEFI).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) Did you boot to <strong>BIOS Setup</strong> &amp; ensure it is set to <strong>
UEFI Mode</strong>? On a Dell, the PF key for that is generally PF2. Keys for other computers &amp; older Dell's are in that Da Costa article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) You must have gotten to your <strong>BIOS Boot Option</strong> screen &amp; must know the key for that (which isn't in Da Costa's article. On a Dell, it generally is PF12). But did you select to boot the Installation Media in UEFI Mode? If the option screen
 offers two choices - select the one that identifies itself to be <strong>UEFI</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IOW</strong>, not only must the computer be set for UEFI - but the media must be booted with the UEFI choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(5) At the installation screen that asks where to install - especially since it is a new HDD &amp; empty -
<strong>delete all the partitions,</strong> if any are there. This will create one block of
<strong>unallocated space</strong>. Select the unallocated space, &amp; click <strong>
next </strong>to start the install. Windows will create multiple partitions &amp; automatically select the right one for the install. It will format the empty HDD in GPT partition style. UEFI uses the GPT format, do
<em>not </em>convert it to MBR.</p>

<p>Hi t87699:<br />
<br />
If you are able to launch Internet Explorer while disconnected from the internet please go to Help | About Internet Explorer and let us know your Update Versions as shown below.&nbsp; If you have Internet Explorer 9 but did not receive update
<strong>v9.0.60 / KB4014661</strong> (<em>Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 9: April 11, 2017</em>) then you might be affect by the Windows Update problem described in the VistaForums FAQ
<strong><em><a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/how-to-fix-vista-sp2-checking-for-updates-hangs-and-slow-windows-updates.305124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix Vista SP2 "Checking for Updates..." Hangs and Slow Windows Updates</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f57be49a-4da8-42e9-9a2d-124bae64f35e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f57be49a-4da8-42e9-9a2d-124bae64f35e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Many Vista SP2 users are just discovering now that their Windows Updates stopped running to completion several months before
<strong>Microsoft ended extended support for Vista SP2 on 11-Apr-2017</strong>.&nbsp; If you are affected by this issue then the KB number in the Update Version of your IE browser should give us some idea of the last time that Windows Update ran successfully on
 your system.<br />
<br />
The only major browser that is still fully supported for Win XP SP3 and Vista SP2 is
<strong>Mozilla's Firefox ESR v52.x</strong> (extended support release), although Mozilla has announced that they will stop releasing further security updates for Firefox ESR v52.x on these older operating systems on
<strong>05-Sep-2018</strong>.&nbsp; If you can browse to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new</a> on your Vista SP2 computer it should auto-detect your operating system and offer you the correct 32-bit or 64-bit Firefox ESR v52.9.0 installer for your region.&nbsp; If that link doesn't offer an English language installer
 then the full offline (standalone) installers for all supported languages are at available at&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/</a>.&nbsp; If necessary, you can download the full offline (standalone) Firefox installer to a USB stick using another computer and then copy the installer to your Vista SP2 desktop.&nbsp; Just make sure you click
 the download tab for FF ESR v52, since the newer FF ESR v60 is not compatible with Win XP SP3 and Vista SP2.<br />

</p><p>Hi t87699:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to download the correct offline installer for Firefox ESR v52.9.0 from
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/</a> using your <strong>Win 10</strong> computer it's possible that download page is auto-detecting your 64-bit Win 10 OS and will only offer the latest 64-bit Firefox ESR v60.1.0 installer.&nbsp; If that's
 the problem, try using one of the direct links below from <strong>Mozilla's FTP site</strong>.&nbsp; Just select the correct installer for your preferred language (e.g. EN-GB = English-British), save it to a USB memory stick, and then copy the offline installer
 (e.g., Firefox Setup 52.9.0esr.exe) to your Vista desktop and double-click to run.</p>

<a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy/builds</a> and download <strong>Speccy Portable</strong> (currently spsetup132.zip) to a USB memory stick.&nbsp; Unzip this file, insert the USB memory stick in your Vista computer and run the Speccy executable (Speccy.exe for 32-bit

</p><p>Hi t87699:<br />
<br />
What is the <strong>make and model</strong> of your Vista computer, and is it a laptop or desktop?<br />
<br />
Did you try downloading the 32-bit Firefox ESR v52.9.0 installer from the alternate
<strong>Mozilla FTP site</strong> I suggested?&nbsp; For 32-bit FF ESR v52.9.0 go to <a href="https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.9.0esr/win32/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.9.0esr/win32/</a> and select the language of your choice.<br />
<br />
Please publish your <strong>full Speccy profile</strong> as I requested&nbsp; in my previous post.&nbsp; If you have problems following my instructions see the Piriform support article
<a href="https://www.piriform.com/docs/speccy/using-speccy/publishing-a-speccy-profile-to-the-web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Publishing a Speccy Profile to the Web</em></a>.&nbsp; Here's the link to a sample Speccy snapshot I published today for my own 32-bit Vista SP2 computer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://speccy.piriform.com/results/YufDfDzYAp6D3hYRqxMeCW1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://speccy.piriform.com/results/YufDfDzYAp6D3hYRqxMeCW1</a><br />
<br />
The first obvious problem I can see from your previous post is that <strong>you only have Service Pack 1 for Vista (released February 4, 2008) installed</strong> so you're likely missing over an entire decade of security updates that won't install until Service
 Pack 2 (released May 25, 2009) is applied.&nbsp; Have you recently tried to re-installed your Vista operating or is there some other reason why your system only has Service Pack 1?&nbsp; You've started multiple threads in this forum recently (which makes it very hard
 to follow what changes you've been making to this computer) but your 26-Jul-2018 thread
<em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/communication-drivers-how-to-install-when/0f29aec9-0744-4482-b7a5-a5e886fd3f38">Communication drivers - how to install when upgrading to Win7</a></em>
 would suggest that you've either tried to reinstall your Vista OS, upgrade from Vista to Win 7, or tried installing incompatible Win 7 device drivers from the Dell support site on your Vista computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I have more bad news for you.&nbsp; You can <strong>download and install the 32-bit Vista Service Pack 2 - Five Language Standalone (KB948465)</strong> from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16468</a>, but as soon as Service Pack 2 is installed you will likely be affected by the problem described in the VistaForums FAQ
<em><a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/how-to-fix-vista-sp2-checking-for-updates-hangs-and-slow-windows-updates.305124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix Vista SP2 "Checking for Updates..." Hangs and Slow Windows Updates</a></em> and
<strong>Windows Update will stop working correctly</strong>.&nbsp; After Vista Service Pack 2 is installed.&nbsp; The instructions in m#l's thread
<strong><em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3?page=1&amp;messageId=1ef00080-91e9-4ffa-a5a3-92f6ecd69c32">Updates
 not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</a></em></strong> should get Windows Update working again so that you can patch your Vista SP2 up to April 2017 with all ~ 200 or so security updates that are probably still missing from your computer,
 but it's going to be a lot of work to get this Vista SP2 machine fully patched again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you already purchased a new Win 10 computer so you should give serious thought to retiring your old Vista machine (which only has
<strong>2 GB of RAM</strong>) before you go through all this trouble.<br />

</p><p>Hi t87699:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you attempt any further changes to your system make sure that you <strong>
back up all your important user files and documents</strong> to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Please
<strong>don't try to install 32-bit Windows 7 drivers on a Vista computer</strong> since this could make your problem worse than it already is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to find Vista-compatible drivers from Realtek, Intel and other websites of the original manufacturers', but if necessary we can deal with that after you patch your Windows OS back to April 2017.&nbsp; If you still have Service Pack 1 then you
 also have <strong>an older version of Internet Explorer like IE7 or IE8</strong> instead of IE9 (released on March 14, 2011, after SP2), and your out-of-date Vista OS and unsupported browser(s) probably have more to do with your web browsing problems than
 out-of-date drivers for your WiFi and network cards. That why I asked you on 25-Jul-2018&nbsp; to open your IE browser and tell me if you had Internet Explorer 9 with Update Version<strong> 9.0.60 / KB4014661</strong>, since those version numbers would give me
 a good idea of the last date Windows Update ran to completion on your system.&nbsp; A full Speccy diagnostic report (which you still haven't posted) would also show me your current driver versions for your hardware components.</p>
<p>

<strong>purchase a new Win 7 upgrade DVD or product key</strong>, and prices on sites like

 your OS on a machine with a relatively slow CPU, limited RAM and older hardware components (e.g., network and graphics cards, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't own a Dell PC so this isn't my area of expertise, but if Dell provided you with an original Microsoft OEM installation DVD for Vista then the VistaForums tutorial<span>

 to perform a clean re-install your OS.&nbsp; I believe that most older Dell desktops with a Vista OS come with a Dell recovery partition on the hard drive so that users can use
<strong>Dell Factory Image Restore</strong> to restore their computer back to factory condition (go to

 a 30-day trial version of McAfee 2008 or some other bundled antivirus) that could cause conflicts with newer software and would have to be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please be warned that if you proceed with either a clean re-install of Vista or a factory reset of your computer
<strong>it won't be any easier to patch your OS and IE browser back to April 2017</strong>.&nbsp; Regardless of the method you use, your Windows Update will stop working again as soon as you install Service Pack 2 , and you will still have to manually apply the

<p>
</p><p>Hi t87699:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to the Dell driver download page for the Studio Hybrid D140G at <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/product-support/product/studio-hybrid/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/product-support/product/studio-hybrid/drivers</a> and select
<strong>Windows Vista, 32-bit </strong>as the operating system I think you should be able to find most, if not all, of the drivers you're looking for.&nbsp; Just make sure you scroll to the bottom of the list and click
<strong>View More</strong> to expand the list until you find the appropriate driver. The Last Updated date of most of those Dell-certified drivers are fairly recent and were posted after Service Pack 2 was released in May 2009 (HP's driver download page for
 my own HP dv6835ca laptop doesn't list any HP-certified network drivers released after 2008) and it's possible that original manufacturers like Realtek, Intel, etc. won't even have newer 32-bit Vista SP2-compatible drivers on their own support sites.</p>

    <title>Family Safety Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acclaim academy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety Errors</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am the Director of Technology at a Charter school in Florida.&nbsp; Due to the amazing price we received on the MS Surface RT we decided to provide all of our students with this amazing tablet.<br />
<br />
We are having a few issues when it comes to family safety settings;<br />
<br />
We currently have around 600 students enrolled all with Surfaces, since this is a school and kids like to let their minds wonder we obviously had to use Family Safety to ensure that wrong materials were not accessed.&nbsp; Up until a few days ago we had manually
 blocked a few pages that we did not want the students on, since they found ways around this we decided to change the web filter to "Designed for Children" as a last resort. Currently we have about 8 Microsoft accounts that we use to manage all of the tablets
 (at the time you were only allowed to manage up to 80 devices per family safety account.
<b>Here is the problem we are having:</b><br />
<br />
There are around 15 websites in total that I must allow students to access, when I allow these sites they work fine, but I have to painstakingly block each tablet one at a time, as you can imagine changing the filter settings on that laptops takes for ever,
 especially since I need to sign in to multiple accounts.&nbsp; I understand that "Family Safety" has a feature that allows you to allow/block websites you have entered for "All Children".&nbsp; The issue is, when I click Allow/Block I am presented with a message that
 asks, "Do you want to allow/block this site for all children?" I click "Yes, all children" but it does not work.&nbsp; I receive no error messages and it seems like everything is fine, but the site is still blocked/unblocked.<br />
<br />
We currently have around 80 devices per account.&nbsp; I do not know if this will help, but I noticed when I click "Link Family Members" at the top of the page we get the following error: "<span>The page you have requested does not exist, has moved, or is temporarily
 down.</span>" We have been receiving this error for about 4 months now, we did notice however that one 2 of our accounts where we have less than 60 devices listed do not come up with this error.&nbsp; I am assuming the issue is the amount of devices we have per
 account.&nbsp; If this is in fact the issue I am a little confused, as the advertised amount of devices per Family Safety account is way more than what we have per account.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If I am doing something wrong or if my information is incorrect please let me know, I appreciate everyone's help in advance.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time, <br />
<br />
Mike<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 and tablet camera</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10 on my ASUS T100TAF, I cannot get my camera to work. It does not even show up in the device manager. What am I missing here? It was working fine before the upgrade, with Windows 8.1, so I'm a bit confused as to what happened
 since the upgrade.

            Unfortunately, this did not help. I cannot even find the drivers for the camera. I have tried the ASUS website, but they do not have them either. Something about upgrading to Windows 10 caused me to lose the ability to use the internal camera on my tablet.
 How, or why, would this happen if it is an internal camera that Windows really shouldn't have any access to adjust?

            Hi! I'm afraid posting your feedback here won't have much of an impact. Just a little background info: Xbox Live is one of the most reliable gaming networks available and in order to achieve that you have to pay for servers and engineers who optimize them/keep
 them running. Therefore it's not like MS is greedy or something like that but obviously they have to operate&nbsp;profitable in order to stay in business.

            On the Xbox, all games that are going to play after multiplayer need an Xbox LIVE Gold membership.<br />
<br />
You must have Gold membership to activate multiplayer.

<p>
</p><p><span>We understan your point, and we sorry to hear about you are disapointed about this or any frustrations this may have caused.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
But unfortunately the agreements that are made between the companies can differ from system to system, as you find many games that are free to play on Xbox that you do not find on PS4, Sony signed an agreement with Epic Games that guarantees that you can play
 on their platform this game for free.<br />
<br />
It would be a really good idea to do the same on Xbox, but that already depends on whether Sony and Epic Games have signed an exclusivity contract.<br />
<br />
However you can submit your idea to vote in this section of which I leave the link:

            When you sign up for Xbox Live as a bonus you get two free Xbox One and two free Xbox 360 games every month. So as an Xbox Live subscriber you do get some value back from the service.

            Then why doesnt sony need to do that? Just makes no sense, if one console can do it, why shouldnt all be the same. The thing is i just wanted to buy an xbox but as soon as i realized that i need to pay $60 for a year of gaming ONE GAME (a free game (i
 have a [mod removed] pc and i wanted to get the cheapest console available so i can atleast play without lag)) like fortnite i just immediately felt so freaking angry and now im gonna be stuck with this pice of [mod removed] oc thag i have.....&nbsp;

            Yeah, but it would be nice if people can actually vote on that link. Many of my friends who agree with the idea of not needing xbox live gold to play fortnite have tried this link, and for every single one of them the link was unavailable / closed. I tried
 to open it myself, but it wont even load.&nbsp;

<h2>            Miracast Not Supported - Nvidia says yes, Windows 10 says no</h2>
                    <p>I had a GTX660 graphics card that showed no Miracast support in DxDiag, so I upgraded to one of the latest. An NVidia 1060.</p>
<p>
</p><p>100% Miracast supported.&nbsp; WDDM 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see in the picture Windows 10P 1607 says it cannot project because the PC does not support Miracast.</p>
<p>(you can insert the sound of me pulling my hair out at that moment..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a snapshot showing DxDiag.txt results. The top mark is in the System Information section, which says Miracast supported.&nbsp; The lower is the NVidia section which shows it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted NVidia technical support and they immediately said it was a MS problem. (uh huh..) and offered zero help on it. So here I am.&nbsp; Unable to connect..</p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

 your specific device, and following their instructions to download and install that firmware. You can also check the Windows Store to see if there’s an app that'll update the firmware on your adapter.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Here. This link&nbsp;will show you the feature in clear terms that we are discussing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;already&nbsp;Connect app with my Windows Phone to connect to&nbsp;post-Anniversary Windows machines,&nbsp;Surface Book, and another Desktop PC (a Velocity Micro NUC) with no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; Yet this capable machine reports that it cannot.&nbsp; That is what we are
 trying to solve.&nbsp; More importantly,&nbsp;a prominent&nbsp;graphics card vendor is saying it is Microsoft's issue.&nbsp;

<p>&gt;&gt;Sadly it needs wifi to work. And a supported wifi card at that. I could never find a list of microsoft wireless display capable wifi cards. Why is this stuff so cryptic Microsoft?! Should just be a an easy way to tell if your rig is wireless display capable
 or not, and if not an easy list of hardware that is compatible with your rig - you can click on and BUY. Of course, why would MS ever want to make it easy... ughhh.</p>

            <p>Hey there guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing the exact same problem when trying to connect my workstation PC to a Samsung 6 series &nbsp;UHD Smart TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workspace OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>TV: Samsung 6 series UHD Smart TV (40KU6092)</p>
<p>My network card :&nbsp;Broadcom NetXtreme 57xx Gigabit Controller &nbsp;--&gt; NdisVersion is 6.30 (= 6.3)</p>
<p>My graphics adapter: NVidia Quadro 2000 --&gt; WDDM version 2.1 (&gt; 1.3)</p>
<p>Dxdiag shows: &nbsp;Miracast: Not Available</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have the workstation connected to the same router that gives wi-fi to the TV. Practically, location of the devices is done via IP's and both the workstation and TV are on the same network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to see the TV in the 'Devices' menu. But I cannot see I get the&nbsp;'Your PC or mobile doesn't support Miracast ...' message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi There - I can see your Broadcomm NetXtreme 57xx is NOT miracast compatible. Sadly, I could not find a MS compatibility list, so right now it's hit or miss... If you find one that works, please share. I'll do the same. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I have installed Samsung Smart View app. By using this I am able to play videos or photos on the TV. I would expect that the installed app uses the same protocol to stream content to the TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, there are two possible options:</p>
<p>1. Samsung's app is using a different protocol than Miracast, which enables the device to send content to the TV flawlessly.</p>
<p>2. Windows 10 has a problem in it's wireless streaming technology, and thus the Miracast error is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tend to think that point 2 is true, since whatever method the Samsung app uses, it makes use of the exact same hardware and is able to play 4k flawlessly over a wi-fi connection, even if my PC is connected to the router via ethernet cable.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled windows 10, &nbsp;because I had windows 10 Pro N and:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>“</span><span>N” and “KN” editions
 of Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro are also available and include the same functionality as the standard editions, except that they do not include certain media related technologies (Windows Media Player, Camera, Music, Movies &amp; TV) and does not include
 the Skype app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am still not able to mirror my computer's screen on the TV, BUT now I get a contextual 'Cast...' option on each video/phone that works great,
 and allows me to cast video/audio to the TV. So practically the only difference between the 'Project' and 'Cast...' functionality would be software based.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I guess that this somehow confirms that the hardware is not an actual problem, and that the only problem resides within the 'Project' option
 in Windows 10.</span></p>
