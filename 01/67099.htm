<h3> benmartinez1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fresh installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am attempting to create a fresh instal of Windows 10 on my brothers HP pavilion 23 and when I&nbsp;get to the drive selection window in the advanced option, I select the drive I want to create the new partition on, hit next and it comes up with the error saying
 that "We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see the Setup log files.". I have also fully formatted the hard drive that I want to install windows onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

            Did you make sure you delete all partitions during setup?
<br />
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.
<br />
<br />If it does not work, then your install media is likely corrupt:
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />FIrst check that there is no SD card in your system, if you have an SD card reader
<br />
<br />Start the installation again, on the first windows press F10, this should open Command Prompt
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />Then at the Diskpart prompt, run this command:
<br />
<br />LIST DISK
<br />
<br />Identify the disk number of the disc to install windows onto
<br />
<br />Run this command (replace DiskNo with the disk number identified in previous step)
<br />
<br />SELECT DISK DiskNo
<br />
<br />Run these command one after each other:
<br />
<br />CLEAN
<br />
<br />CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY
<br />
<br />ACTIVE
<br />
<br />FORMAT FS=NTFS QUICK
<br />
<br />ASSIGN LETTER=C
<br />
<br />
<br />Type EXIT twice

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>I attempted to remove the UBS drive from the device but when I went through the Custom options and selected the drive, it said that "We couldn't install Windows in the location you chose. Please check your media drive.". So I reconnected the USB drive and
 the same message came up as last time. I think it may be because there are already two partitions on the same drive but the first one says MSR(reserved) in the "type" collum and the other says primary. Partition 1 (the one that says MSR) has 128MB of 128MB
 free and the other has 931.2GB of 931.4 GB free. Does this mean that I need to delete one of them?</p>

<h2>            I have a Dell Inspiron N7010 with Windows 7 that won&#39;t start</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I` ve got some problems with my laptop for a few months already and I have no idea how to fix them. I hope my question belongs to this topic because I have to find the cause of my problem. I presume it`s something wrong with the system. As it is in the
 title, I have Dell Inspiron N7010 laptop which just won`t start. When I press the power button, it goes to Dell logo with F2 and F12 &nbsp;in the lower right corner of the screen. When I press one of &nbsp;them, I can go to the Set up or the Boot option, and it seems
 everything is fine there, but I am not an expert, so I`m not completely sure either. The problem is that the system won`t boot, it won`t start up. I have Windows 7, 64-bit. After the Dell logo, my sreen goes black with blinking cursor in the upper left corner
 and it can stay like that for hours. I tried to remove the battery and then put it back, but it didn`t work (I saw it as a solution for a similar problem on other forum, but as I could see, not quite useful). I`ve been on other forums, but there are mentioned
 CD`s for some tests of the computer, Windows recover, drivers, but I didn`t get any of them when I got this laptop. I also noticed that lamp for hdd works when I turn on &nbsp;my laptop, then blinks for a while, maybe 20sec and then doesn` t work. I don`t know
 what went wrong because I remember it worked fine, until I turned it off one day (it might be incorrectly, because I had to rush or something). &nbsp;I have it for a year now and I hope it isn`t something serious. If you have a solution or any idea how to fix this,
 I`d really appreciate it. &nbsp;Thank you in advance.</div>
                </div>

            If you have no data that needs to be preserved then I recommend you perform a destructive Factory Restore. You will find detailed instructions on the Dell site.
<div><br />
<div>If you need to salvage some data and have no external backup (which would be a reminder to back up all important data regularly) then you should post again for instructions on how to back up this data prior to the destructive Factory Restore.</div>

<h2>            No sound from right speaker &#47; Can&#39;t configure speakers</h2>
                    Hi all<br />
<br />
I have a new Sony laptop and just tried plugging my 2.1 computer speakers into it.&nbsp; Sound is only coming out of the left satellite and subwoofer.&nbsp; When I try to Configure them from the Sound control panel, the only speaker set-up listed on the Speaker Wizard
 is Stereo, and only the first (left) test tone plays from the left satellite, then silence (no right test tone).<br />
<br />
Everything works fine on the integrated laptop speakers, but they're laptop speakers, so I would like to be able to use my old speakers when I'm at my desk.<br />
<br />
Windows Update and Sony Vaio Update did not recommend any new audio controller drivers.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed the latest driver from the Realtek website but that didn't work at all so I rolled it back to the version that came with the system.<br />
<br />
The speakers work fine with my older laptop and my cell phone, so, the fault isn't with the right satellite either.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Drew<br />

<h3> richard-934  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Always show icons, never thumbnails&#34; box in Windows 8 and 10 doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Even though the box has <strong><em>always </em></strong>been <strong><em>unchecked</em></strong>, all Pictures sometimes, without warning nor explanation, sometimes following an update, will revert to generic icons. Every time this happens, thumbnails
 can be restored only by letting Windows slowly restore each thumbnail, one by one over a period of several hours for my thousands of photos, a process which finally destroyed one HDD. I repeat for those who apparently do not want to hear this: the&nbsp;<strong>"Always
 show icons, never thumbnails"&nbsp;</strong>box has <strong><em>always </em></strong>been
<strong><em>unchecked. </em></strong>This has been a problem on Windows 8, 8.1 and now 10. Does anyone know how this problem can be remedied?

            Rebuilding thumbnail cache is an operation that can occur for a huge wide variety of circumstances, including after updates.&nbsp; It can also happen after using disk cleanup (the built-in one or other tools like CCleaner and such).&nbsp; Without a specific instance
 to debug, anything we could offer would be speculation.

            <p><span><span>Hello Richard,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums. We are glad to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I request you to use
</span><span>the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation
 as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, try this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Go to Start menu and then click on Settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Choose Accounts and then select Other User Accounts towards the left.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select Add an Account.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Enter a user name and press Next.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on Finish.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new account.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check if issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Feel free to get back to us for further queries. We will be happy to assist you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks and regards,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Jenith</span></span></p>

            Where was any help offered.&nbsp; you only repeated the problem and gave some of the reasons why it happened.&nbsp; You failed to fix the problem or even give a hint as to what we may try in order to remedy it.&nbsp; NO, this was definitely not helpful.&nbsp; If I want help,
 I do not you to repeat my problem, give not one solution ( or Hint to one), and then ask, "Was this helpful?"&nbsp; Do you people get money for visits to this site?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder no one else likes this site!

            <p>You're right - there's hundreds or thousands of reasons it could happen.&nbsp; Like I said already, without a specific instance to debug, anything we could offer would be total speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, we need to see it happening so we can diagnose it.&nbsp; Is it happening to you right now?&nbsp; What's the situation you're in?&nbsp; We need to know something (you didn't give any info).&nbsp; Without your cooperation in telling us what's happening, we can't help.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 CAST Connection to Samsung Smart TV failed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 CAST Connection to Samsung Smart TV failed</h2>
                    I tried casting a move from Windows 10 PC on to my Samsung Smart TV. Initially I connected my WiFi enabled Samsung M5570 Smart TV through Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices. Windows 10 readily recognized the TV and I was able to CAST
 my Windows 10 screen to my Samsung TV. However, later I disconnected and tried to reconnect the same device again, but Windows 10 could not detect my TV. The search is going never ending. What I should do? [I am able to remove and reconnect my TV many times
 via my Android Mobile using CAST feature.]

<h2>            Application Virtualization Client 4.6 SP2 error 1603 &#47; 1708</h2>
                    Previous MSI deployments of 4.6, SP1, and hotfix 3. I believe the prereqs were installed separately since the MSIs were used rather than the EXEs. Everything has been working perfectly until I try to roll out SP2 via setup_upgrade.exe. Here are the errors
 from the log:<br />
<br />

I'm not finding any details about SWI41sp1UpgradeFix / Softgrid 4.1SP1/4.2 client errors. Both of these GUIDs are installed and visible in the registry. All I can think is that this is somehow due to the previous MSI deployments rather than EXE and / or corrupt
 components?<br />

            <p>hi</p>
<p>I was going through some of the issues we saw during the 4.5 beta and came across another one I thought you might find interesting.&nbsp; This is one where the installation of the App-V client will fail with the following error:
</p>
<p><strong><font color="#004080">"Installation operation failed. Error 1708"</font></strong>
</p>
<p>If you then check the Verbose MSI log you'll also see something along the lines of the following:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#004080">============================= <br />

<p>The key here is where it says <strong><em>MainEngineThread is returning 1603</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The exact cause of this can vary but is most likely due to a performance counter registration related issue.&nbsp; This can happen when a previous version of the client was installed at one time and the unregister failed when it was uninstalled, or there could
 be registry / file permissions on the machine that are not allowing the creation of one of the temporary files needed to create and register the performance counters.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To fix this we'll need to clean up the client in question in order to allow a proper re-installation.&nbsp; To do this open a CMD prompt on the client in question and run the following commands:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#004080">regsvr32 /u mavcperf.dll</font></strong></p>
<p>and then</p>
<p><strong><font color="#004080">mofcomp &lt;PATH&gt;\SGCliprvUninstall.Mof</font></strong>
</p>
<p>Note: If you are unable to unregister mavcperf.dll (step #1 above) you can perform the following steps:
</p>
<p>1.) Run the following command from a command prompt: </p>
<p><font color="#004080"><strong>unlodctr "Mav Client PerfMon Provider"</strong></font>
</p>
<p>2.) Delete the following registry key:&nbsp; </p>
<p>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MAV Client PerfMon Provider</p>
<p>With any luck, once you do this the client will now install without error.</p>
<p>I'd also like to extend a special thanks to Steve Thomas.&nbsp; He diligently worked so many of these beta issues and discovered many of the solutions I post here, including this one.&nbsp; Without him many of these issues would go undocumented.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

JPIFSwongcly</a>. I should have been a little more thorough in my initial post. I actually found this info in my research, but when I run

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>I thought i'd write up a quicky&nbsp;blog post on using the ConfigMgr Task Sequence to deploy Software Packages, and reveal&nbsp;select parts of the functionality available
 to you to accomplish the task.</span></p>
<p><span>Open up your ConfigMgr console, navigate to the Operating System Deployment node and right click "Task Sequences"</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select âCreate a new custom task sequenceâ</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Give it a name</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Donât choose a boot package</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Bring the new Task Sequence up in the Task Sequence Editor</span></p>
<p><span>Here we go, useful options available to you are:</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>General:</span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>Run Command Line</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Install Software</span></span></p>
<p><span>Connect to Network Folder</span></p>
<p><span>The other categories deal with Disks, User State, Images, Drivers and Settings and most are OSD specific and not much use when deploying Software.
</span></p>
<p><span>So, those three commands under the General category donât seem much do they? But these puppies give you a lot of control and ability over your package execution.</span></p>
<p><span>Hereâs a breakdown of the abilities each of these commands gives you:</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>Run Command Line</span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Command line can contain NT BATCH statements, but is a bit limited in that the script has to sit on one line. Easy enough if you can use | and &amp;/&amp;&amp;, and
 other command line tricks to achieve the end result. It can be an executable, a script or any extension that has an association mapped to an application on the client.</span></p>
<p><span><span><font><span>&nbsp;</span>âStart inâ is an absolute path to the file system on the client, or relative to the Distribution
 Point.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span>Cough, that just gave the game away. Yes, relative to the Distribution Point, meaning you can run scripts that reside in a package that is assigned to
 a Distribution Point. This is powerful in itself. You could have a âManagement Scriptsâ package and just load it up with scripts\executables et al, and you can now invoke any of these tools from your toolkit. Iâve worked for many a company that has a stash
 of scripts and tools on a shared area that are both for engineers and used in deployments. Maybe itâs time to copy these in to a ConfigMgr package.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In Configuration Manager R2 you can specify the credentials that are used to launch the Command Line. Thatâs something I remember a colleague
 in a past company complained was missing in the jump from SMS 2.0 to SMS2003 (Token nod to Etienne @ BNP), sure this will make him happy now
</span><span><span><font>J</font></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you want to capture output from a program you need to prefix the command with CMD.EXE /C</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>Install Software</span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Pretty straight-forward, you select an existing Package and Program and execute it as part of the Task Sequence. You can execute multiple applications
 here, but being stuck in my ways I like to separate out the software installations in to separate steps. Essentially, so I can control error codes per execution, whether a failure is OK or if the Task Sequence should abort (drop out/exit).</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>Connect to Network Folder</span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Typical behavior youâd expect from Windows Explorer Map Network Drive function. Provide the Path, choose the Drive letter and supply the credentials to
 map the connection with.</span></p>
<p><span>Now itâs time to add another layer of complexity and thus, control, and introduce the Options tab that is available for all activities in the Task Sequence.</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>Options tab</span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Firstly you can Enable\Disable a step, and as this is all Policy based the switching on and off or even modifying the Task Sequence is done pretty quick as
 it only depends on a policy update being applied to the MPâs and this replicates quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>You also can âContinue on errorâ which is very handy for hopping over steps that could fail but are not critical to the entire Task Sequence.</span></p>
<p><span>The Task Sequence provides you with very limited conditional evaluation methods. You have limited conditional evaluation at hand with the trusty IF statement.
 Limited in that it meets evaluation criteria based on <font><b>All</b>,
<b>Any</b> or <b>None</b> of the conditions evaluating as positive\negative. No complex IF statements here, but enough control to do some fancy tricks in this space.</font></span></p>
<p><span>The conditions are:</span></p>
<p><span>Task Sequence Variable (limited usefulness really)</span></p>
<p><span>Operating system Version</span></p>
<p><span>File Properties</span></p>
<p><span>Folder Properties</span></p>
<p><span>Registry Setting</span></p>
<p><span>Query WMI</span></p>
<p><span>Install Software</span></p>
<p><span>Now this certainly isnât a scripting engine, so I donât expect much functionality along those lines. But it does give us enough juice to do some interesting
 things with the installation of a product and its dependencies, even setting up the stage in readiness for the deployment is made simple using the above methods. And once youâve setup your Task Sequence you can advertise it like you would a Program in a Package
 to any amount of Clients.</span></p>
<p><span>Comparing the Task Sequence as a Software Deployment method with the traditional Software Deployment method, you can see that we now have an additional tool
 in our toolset for managing these deployments.</span></p>
<p><span>Going forward, Iâd really like the ConfigMgr Developers to shine some love on this aspect of the product. Make it a bit more robust by allowing me to do string
 manipulation, let me manipulate data from the output of command lines or existing data repositories (LOG, TXT, CSV, etc).<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>Allow me to query WMI\File System\Registry etc and put that data in to a string that I can evaluate on, rather than defining what I expect to see then evaluating it for positive\false.
</font></span></p>
<p><span>This could become a real monster aspect of the ConfigMgr product, and give the Application deployment teams far more control over the deployment than they
 already have using the traditional Software Deployment feature. </span></p>
<p><span>Grow this area out please Microsoft!</span></p>
<p><span>This article was rushed out on a lunch break, itâs really only there to pique your interest and perhaps motivate you in to thinking of using Task Sequences
 for more than rebuilding OSâs. The amount of SMS administrators I come across, that when I talk about this stuff their eyes light up as if they have figured out how many black holes
<a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>CERN</font></a> will introduce to our planet when they switch on the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7543089.stm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>Ring of Death</font></a>! And hence why I thought Iâd take the time out between munching on a sandwich to tap furiously on my keyboard to bring this to you.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Always happy to hear horror\success stories, or anything related to Software Deployments using Task Sequences!<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>So ping me an email or comment on my blog </font></span><span><span><font>J</font></span></span></span></p>

    <title>Windows Explorer has stopped working. Same thing for Task Manager. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lazyhawk16  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer has stopped working.  Same thing for Task Manager.</h2>
                    I have Windows Vista, and have had this computer for several years.<br />
<br />
I was trying to work on something yesterday and I found that all of my Office 2007 programs would crash immediately upon opening, whereas they had been working fine about a week ago (last time we used them).&nbsp; I ran the diagnostics program and did not come up
 with anything, and then installed a bunch of windows updates that I got automatically.&nbsp; When the computer restarts now, I get a window in the corner that says "Personalized Settings," then a window comes up and tells me that Windows Explorer has stopped working.&nbsp;
 I can ctrl/alt/del and open Task Manager, but when I try to do anything in that, it also stops working.&nbsp; I don't download anything so I really don't think this is a virus.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I cannot open any programs or menus, although I think I can get a command screen.&nbsp; I ran all of the tests in the install disc and didn't get anywhere either.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            I can show you a workaround until Microsoft corrects their known problem.<br />
<br />
As soon as you get into Desktop hit <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; CTRL/ALT/DEL to get into Task Manager<br />
2.&nbsp; Click on the Applications Tab (Top left hand corner)<br />
3.&nbsp; Click on the New Task Button (bottom right hand corner)<br />
4.&nbsp; In the open box enter&nbsp; <strong>explorer </strong>and hit the enter key<br />
5.&nbsp; Do step 3 and 4 once more as quickly as possible<br />
<br />
This should stop the recycling process of the error message<br />
<br />
Once the recycle process stops you can exit Task Manager and minimize the explorer window.&nbsp; You should also be able to exit the Task Manger and Explorer windows now.&nbsp; If not, just keep the explorer window minimized.<br />
<br />
You should now be able to use your computer as normal.<br />
<br />
Let me know how this works for you.&nbsp; If it works well, spread the word.<br />

<p>But now, it wont even work at all, and only my usb mouse shows up in device manager, not my touchpad. so I have no clear way of fixing this.</p>

            Hi L4ci_,
<br />
<br />Yes Windows 10 will run really well on that system . . .
<br />
<br />Acer does not provide device drivers for Windows 10, but I checked and they are all available from the respective Manufacturers - Intel . . . etc.
<br />
<br />So, no problem, you can go ahead an upgrade . . .

            Plus from Dave's advice
<br />Windows 8.1 and 10 share same hardware model so all Windows 8.1 drivers would work in Windows 10.

            You can always try out Windows 10 on it first without activating and see if Windows 10 detects all the hardware - which it should. 
<br />
<br />If it doesn't you can always reset and reinstall Windows 8.1 which will work. 
<br />
<br />Here are the steps for Windows 10, I will post the Windows 8.1 reinstall instructions in another reply.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE - GO WITH WINDOWS 10 HOME
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<h2>            Black box appears for a split second when I log in to my computer</h2>
                    Black box appears for a split second when I log in to my computer. I read a post that asked to command prompt a schedule file and of which I have done, and I was just wondering if someone can help me out with deciphering the code and seeing what this black
 box is, is it harmful, and if I can remove this black box. Thank you

<p>Hi Marvin,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to have disappeared for now and I guess I can respond to this feed if it reappears?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your queries just in case we need to take this further:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No I have not made any significant hardware or software changes. The only large file I downloaded was a game which was 40GB approx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I will try my best to send a screenshot, however, it appears for less than a second. It looks like the black CMD box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have taken no troubleshooting steps as it does not effect my daily usage. I was just wondering how to get rid of it as it was very annoying.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Shneur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's good to hear that the issue disappeared. In case in happens again in the future, go to
<strong>Task Manager &gt; Startup</strong> tab and disable all your startup programs. One of which might be causing the command prompt to pop. Also, you check your
<strong>Task </strong><strong>Scheduler </strong>if there's any automated task that was set up. Let us know if you encounter any issues in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have a good one.</p>

<h2>            A short letter to Bill Gates</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p><span>Hey,</span></p>
<p><span>I've been using </span><span>Windows</span><span> since I first laid my hands on a PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>Until today everything was pretty much painless, or I was stronger.
</span></p>
<p><span>But as we grow more mature as a user and professional, we can't forgive little flaws with that ease anymore.
</span></p>
<p><span>So here it goes, a reminder for you to work on the basics: </span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>1.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ba2c8f0-496e-4b03-a388-a11c2298ea54" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ba2c8f0-496e-4b03-a388-a11c2298ea54" /></a></p>
<p>Link to image: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JycKjS8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Alt+Click to open http://i.imgur.com/JycKjS8.png in a new tab">http://i.imgur.com/JycKjS8.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you see a Dismiss button anywhere or a red cross? There is none (they think this way you are more likely to install the update finally), and it's awful UX, as I'm sure you already suspect this. Please add one. I don't need your AI Siri
 or any other shmancy-fancy feature, I just need a good UX on my OS. First, get the basics right then move to AI.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>2. The issue above is about the limited space on my PC, so here's my Feedback P.2:
</span></p>
<p><span>Why in the hell you keep insisting with your updates - up to the point that you restart the system closing all running programs and potentially ruining unsaved work (happened to me)?
</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, you gave me a warning about a scheduled restart? If you are so helpful and proactive why don't you have a way in the system to free up some space on Drive C: when there is not enough space even to do partitioning (like 30Mb)?
</span></p>
<p><span>Because this is the reason why I can't install your updates. So please stop bugging people and build into the system a solution that would allow them to release space in such circumstances. But start with the button (see above).</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>3. Each piece of software has a button to submit feedback, not Windows though. Can you add or point me to one please?</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<span>4. Your support is non-existant and online chat doesn't work on your website - is it just for show, not to be behind your competition too much? Please remove it then. Add email support instead (who got this brilliant idea to remove email support
<span>4. Your support is non-existant and online chat doesn't work on your website - is it just for show, not to be behind your competition too much? Please remove it then. Add email support instead (who got this brilliant idea to remove email support
 and have only phone and not working chat support?).</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. And one more time - please stop begging people to install your updates, offer a solution instead.
</span></p>
</div>
</div>
                </div>

            Fun fact: Bill Gates' last day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He is no longer on the Microsoft board or otherwise associated with Microsoft. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't read this community forum.

<h2>            Console is spitting out my discs</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 360 slim. I was playing MW3 but when i went to switch to a different game i inserted the disc, it said reading, then flashed play game for a second before opening the tray again. I have tried with other discs and the same thing happens. It reads
 the disc and then spits it back out. I tried the discs on another console and they worked so i know the problem isn't with the discs. Is there any way to fix it?</p>

                    Stuck on black screen when turning on xbox one. Tried the hard boot fix which worked once then problem happened again on next start up. Tried power off and restart with no luck. All cables are properly connected (system worked fine before February of this
 year) Any suggestions as to a fix?&nbsp;

            Hello David sorry to see you are dealing with the black screen. Was your console in the middle of an update when this occurred. You might want to try an offline update if that is the case, it has been known to fix a problem like this.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about your console woes. :/ </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend a manual system update, as this kind of issue is known for when the console loads and hangs on a black or green screen, or due to a poorly installed system update. More here:

    <title>Minecraft no longer works after upgrading From Windows 8.0 to 8.1, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dreamxyz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft no longer works after upgrading From Windows 8.0 to 8.1, Netflix also stopped having sound playing in IE. UGGGH&#33;</h2>
                    Help!<br />
I upgraded my Dell 1737 from Vista to Windows 8.0 Pro and I was happy as everything worked 10 times better than running Vista.<br />
<br />
I did not hesitate to upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro (?, downloaded straight from the store) and now I am really regretting it.<br />
<br />
How do I get back to 8.0 pro without having to reinstall Vista and then Windows 8.0?<br />
<br />
If not recommended, please help me fix the two problems.<br />
<br />
1. Minecraft will no longer launch.<br />
<br />
2. Netflix won't play movies WITH sound.&nbsp; The image streams without the sound.&nbsp; I can use the Netflix app but the quality of video is horrendous.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
