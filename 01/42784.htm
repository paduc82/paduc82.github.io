<h2>            Surface book file download and wifi issues</h2>
                    <p>I need to download files from Dropbox for work, and the files are stored in several different folders. Recently I've been having an issue where if the folder only contains a few files (e.g. around 20 or less) I am able to download all of them without issues,
 though I still must download them one-by-one because my surface book is unable to download entire folders anymore either. However when I attempt to then download files from a different Dropbox folder afterwards or if I need to download more than ~20 files
 from one single folder, I start to have issues downloading. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest files that I attempt to download normally take less than 2 minutes to download, but as soon as I switch to a different Dropbox folder to download from or I try to download many files they soon begin to take upwards of 20, 30 minutes and then
 stop downloading altogether. Once this happens I am unable to download any other files as they all run into the same problem - the download speed slows to 0 kB/s and gets stuck there. I originally thought it was because I was downloading too many files at
 once, but even when I began only downloading one file at a time and made sure to let one file finish downloading completely before starting the other (which in itself was very inconvenient because it means I have to sit in front of my computer and check it
 every few minutes to start the new download instead of being able to get other work done in lab), I still had this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the downloading starts running into problems, I then begin to have issues with WiFi as well; my surface book says it's connected to WiFi and I'm able to get notifications but no webpages (in Chrome
<em>or </em>Microsoft Edge) will load, livestreams will freeze, etc. Restarting the browser doesn't fix the problem; only completely restarting my computer does, but even then it's only a temporary fix and I'm still faced with the same downloading issues as
 before where I can download up to ~20 files from only a single Dropbox folder before I run into problems again and have to restart my computer. I am able to use my phone normally and no one else at work is experiencing these internet/download issues, so I
 know it's something to do with my surface book. These issues have only started to happen in the last week, and I didn't change anything on my computer recently other than connecting a Microsoft bluetooth mouse. What can I do to fix this? It's very inconvenient
 to have to restart my computer several times just to get files downloaded so I am able to do what I need to.</p>

<h2>            shift key acting like it&#39;s stuck, ctrl and num keys don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>hi, so i did not use my laptop for around three weeks, finally turned it on today and was able to log in fine but after a few minutes i noticed something was off (clicking on icons on taskbar would launch a new window) and after googling around, i noticed
 all the symptoms: all caps lock, taskbar icons would open a new window, clicking on a desktop icon would select several icons, were the shift key acting like it's being pressed (even though it wasn't and it's not physically stuck since i can press it down
 no problems), my ctrl key isnt working either and neither is my number keys. i resarted it and when i got to the log in screen, i couldn't type in my pin, password wouldn't work either since i have numbers in it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>ease of access button won't work from the log in screen (it just won't pop up) and the only way i could log in, i noticed, was by clicking 'i forgot my pin' and then it will take me to a new window asking me to type in my password (onscreen keyboard and
 ease of access works in this window), closing it and for some reason i type in my pin after that and the number keys work. i get to my desktop and everything seems to work fine for about a few seconds, then goes back to the whole 'shift key being pressed'
 situation.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>tried the onscreen keyboard on my desktop and sometimes it would work, like typing in my onedrive login details, but other times, like typing on my chrome browser or on notepad, it's all caps and i can't type numbers, even if i click 'shift' off (like it
 types all caps on the browser but 'shift' is off, other times when i click the onscreen keyboard to type the shift key is colored blue, and that means it's pressed). ran a scan on my antivirus, ran keyboard troubleshooter, ran malwarebytes and they all came
 up clean. tried toggling off sticky keys, etc and pressing the 'shift' key several times, and all other quick fixes i found, and nope, nothing worked. also updated windows and restarted but still the same.<br />
</p>
<p>like i said, its a laptop so i dont have an extra keyboard to plug in and i don't really want to spend money buying a usb keyboard only to find out it having the same problem. i'm not sure if it's a hardware issue since it does work fine for a few seconds
 after logging in. having a hard time running sfc since i can't press the '/' key and i'm wondering if i should just reset my pc (while keeping all the files)? i don't have a problem doing that (apart from theanxiety<br />
inducing 4 hours waiting for it to reset) since i don't really have much programs in it that i can't reinstall and all my files are backed up. i also reset it before to fix a display problem.</p>
<p>oh, i also play borderlands 2 in it, which does use the shift key a lot but, i dont really play that it much and this laptop is just about a year old, never spilled anything on it (i use a liquid lcd cleaner on a rag and i'm very careful about not getting
 any liquids on it at all), would go for periods of time without being used so its not like its being overused. the last time i used the laptop there were no issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so yeah, what i'd like to know is could it be hardware? or will resetting my pc hopefully fix it? or is there another fix that i don't know about and could try? thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;janieneh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the keyboard issue that you're experiencing may be due to having an outdated driver or could be a software conflict. However, there's also a chance that sticky keys may have been enabled on your laptop. Before we try to troubleshoot
 the software side, please try the following workarounds and see if one on the list addresses the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Turning off Sticky Keys.</strong>
<ul>
<li>If this feature is turned on, then have it turned off. Just navigate to <strong>
Settings &gt; Ease of access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Sticky Keys</strong>, then toggle it <strong>
Off</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Holding down both Shift keys.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold down both Shift keys at the same time for 4 to 5 seconds.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Perform full shutdown</strong>
<ul>
<li>To perform a full shutdown, click the <strong>Windows key &gt; Power Icon &gt; Shutdown</strong>. Once computer is off, press the power button to boot it up.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Please let me know if the issue persists after performing the steps above by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<span>what's strange is that my keyboard acts normal for a few minutes after booting up but then goes back to acting like the shift key is stuck. i've used that small window of time to log in to my different accounts
 and during that i can type numbers and special characters while holding the shift key, and type the rest of my log in details fine. after several minutes, i think, when the laptop loads all of the apps or when it is fully booted up, that's when the shift key
 problem starts. another strange thing is the problem disappears when i am installing something.</span><span><br />

<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
<span>i am not sure if it is they keyboard itself since i am currently unable to acquire an external USB keyboard or if the keyboard short circuited due to humidity? i live in the tropics and it is very humid,
 and i kept the laptop inside a closed drawer to keep away dust and bugs, also put in several moisture absorbers just in case. or if it is a software problem or conflict? because like i said, it works fine just a few minutes after booting up. i am not very
 good with computers so i'm not sure if it's hardware or software causing this.</span><span><br />

    <title>Windows 7 cannot load some websites. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martineggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 cannot load some websites.</h2>
                    I've recently started upgrading my home network to Windows 7 and I am experiencing that some web sites are not accessible both through wireless or ethernet connections, although I can ping the websites and the DNS resolves appropriately.<br />
<br />
For example, I can browse http://www.micrsoft.com, but not http://www.google.com.<br />
<br />
I don't have any of these issues on my old XP box as everything works fine. I am connecting to the internet using a PPPoP connection to AT&amp;T through an ADSL modem and a NETGEAR FVS318 ProSafe VPN Firewall Router. Both pieces are about 5 years old.<br />
<br />
On the other hand though, if I am establishing a VPN connection to work and route traffic through that connection all websites work fine.
<br />
<br />
So I am wondering if this is an equipment based problem or related to IPv6 that is being used by windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you get any error message?<br />
Is your computer on domain?</p>
<p><br />
First I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</p>
<p>Second the issue may be caused due to a corrupted add-on in Internet Explorer. To confirm the same, run Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>To open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</p>
<p>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<p>Delete the corrupted add-on and restart Internet Explorer normally and check if the issue reappears.</p>
<p>If the above method did not fix the issue and as you have tried all the possible methods to resolve issue to no avail I would suggest you to try to perform Internet Explorer Optimization on your computer and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>You may also contact your Internet Service Provider and check if there is any issue from their end or not.

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can still use the same email address but only after 60 days the account has been deleted. This is because when an account is marked for&nbsp;closure, Microsoft has a 60-day waiting period before permanently deleting it, in case&nbsp;you change your mind or
 you need to access something associated with your account before it's gone forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

            <span>Hi LindsayKulas,<br />
<br />
1. What exactly do you mean by </span><span>"shift to blue number/symbols"?<br />
2. Does the shift key work any time correctly?<br />
3. From how long are you facing this issue?<br />
</span><span><br />
I would suggest you to try using onscreen keyboard and check if the issue persist.<br />
<br />
Type without using the keyboard (On-Screen Keyboard)<br />

<h2>            HP Laptop with Windows 8 will not allow a Reset to factory default</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP laptop that came preloaded with Windows 8, but no&nbsp;installation media apart from the&nbsp;HP and Graphics Drivers.</p>
<p>I have reset the laptop about&nbsp;3 times since I've had it, using this default approach:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Settings</li><li>Select Change PC Settings&nbsp;</li><li>Select the General Tab</li><li>Click the Get Started button for the Remove everything and reinstall Windows</li><li>On the first&nbsp;screen, confirm the reset</li><li>When the two options come up (1. Remove everything except my files and Reinstall Windows, 2. Remove everything from HDD and reinstall Windows)</li><li>Regardless of what&nbsp;option I try, it reports that something has gone&nbsp;wrong, and it wont proceed.</li></ul>
<p>I've tried the advanced settings options but I get the error code 80070490 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to&nbsp;reset my PC? I don't mind removing or&nbsp;keeping my&nbsp;files as I've created backups.</p>
<p>Remember, I don't have any&nbsp;form of media for Windows 8 as it is part of the HP system files within a Partition named RECOVERY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can get around this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the Recovery partition or access to it&nbsp;is corrupted.</p>
<p>Try accessing it at Boot and if not possible,&nbsp;download and create your own Recovery Media for 8.1.</p>
<p>By the way, 8.1 is a free upgrade from 8 and Microsoft is stopping support for 8 next month; Jan 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these HP steps to do a Recovery to Factory Settings (new condition).</p>

            Hi Rahul, that error seems to be generated by the Camera app itself . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find the Camera App
<br />
<br />Click that and choose 'Advanced Options'
<br />
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />When that completes, try using your Camera again and see if the issue is resolved . . .       
        </p>

            Can you install the "Media Feature Pack for Windows 10 N (April 2018)" that is available from the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />That may help media related features such as the camera.
<br />
<br />Be sure to restart the computer afterwards.

<h2>            Front panel audio not working in Win7 64bit</h2>
                    Hello, I have installed Windows 7 64bit and I cannot get sound from my headphones nor microphone from the front panel plug. When I open Audio Options, it say Not Plugged In, but I have already plugged in my headphones. When I used Win XP, it worked perfectly.
 Is there a way to solve it? The rear panel works fine, but I would like to use the front one sometimes as well. Thanks in advance

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>You have mentioned that some Window 8 tiles and apps are missing and you couldn’t find the Epson download nav. I would like to ask you few question first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are all the apps and tiles missing or just a particular one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You have mentioned “can’t find Epson download nav”? Are you referring to Epson download navigator? Is this program installed in your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to your computer before this issue started?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program is unpinned from the start menu, then you won’t see it in your start screen. To check if the program is installed in your computer and then pin it to the start screen, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click on any empty space on the start screen</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now, an app bar would pop up in the bottom</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on All apps option to view a list of all apps installed</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Check if the app you are looking for is listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to see the app in the list, then it was probably unpinned from the start menu. To pin it back to the start menu, right click on the app tile on the list and click Pin to start in the app bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us with more information so that we can help you better.</p>

            When I right click on the desktop I see the all apps icon but when clicked it does not show any tiles or apps at all. I was using a graphics program when the screen went blue and on restart it went though the process of setting up for the first time use.
 When finished I get a backdrop but no tiles at all. I cannot use the system refresh either. All I can do is right click in the bottom left corner to access my programs. Kris

            <p>This may sound stupid, but could you verify that clicking with two fingers isn't seen as a 'right click'? If clicking with two fingers is indeed seen as a 'right click', you can change this by doing the following:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X, click Control Panel.</li><li>Click Hardware and Sound, then click Mouse.</li><li>Click the tab for Device Settings, then click on the button Settings.</li><li>A new window should open in which you can find the settings for your touchpad.</li></ol>
<p>You should be able to alter the behaviour of your touchpad there.</p>

<p>Just open your</p>

<p>and then "<strong>power options</strong>" then ("Change plan settings" then)&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<strong>change advanced power settings</strong>"</p>

<p>Note :- not necessary to turn it on for "<strong>plugged in</strong>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I just copied and pasted (and edited slightly) the above from another forum - if that doesn't fix your problem, continue reading below - this solution was also was from another writer, but I started a new discussion because I got tired of reading things
 that didn't work over and over again and this worked for me and I was so happy about it I wanted to share it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above does not work, because it is already "on", try going to the "critical battery action" (top of the list in the same menu) &nbsp;and change the battery option from "hibernate" to "shut down" - this worked for me - then you can change it back to hibernate
 and it will stay working - it did for me anyway.</p>

    <title>Connection airpods troubles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kabirvashishth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection airpods troubles</h2>
                    <p>Today my Apple Airpods that I use with my laptop began to only output at max volume. Regardless of the position of the volume slider, the Airpods output volume equivalent to level 100. Muting does work, but any other level is too loud. Recently,
 I updated by drivers for Windows and Intel, so I'm thinking that may be the source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's fairly annoying because they function more like speakers than earbuds now, and the volume is too high to healthily listen too. Is this an issue with Windows, Intel, Apple, or some combination? I have tried reinstalling my drivers for both Bluetooth
 and Stereo.</p>

            Hi  kabirvashishth
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Have you tried unpairing the Airpods in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth 
<br />
<br />Use the Add Bluetooth wizard in Control Panel
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add device then add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth Support Service
<br />Right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab
<br />Click in the Startup type: listbox
<br />Choose Automatic
<br />Click Start
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try include the Bluetooth troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth
<br />Click Bluetooth then click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Bluetooth
<br />Right click each entry then click Properties
<br />Select the driver tab, click Rollback if its not grayed out.
<br />
<br />If it is grayed out, right click Bluetooth driver then click uninstall
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />If not, remove any other Bluetooth devices since they might be causing interference .
<br />
<br />You can also try pairing through Devices and Printers. Learn more:

<h2>            windows 7 professional</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello people.........after 4 straight nights of reading reviews of Windows 8, it is simple, I am not purchasing it. Too many bad things have occured. Even a guy from microsoft told me on the phone support that I should purchase Windows 7 Professional.......basically
 because it will be 7 years before support ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read reviews from all types&nbsp;of sites. From amazon to yahoo.&nbsp;But a common "statement" was the following: quote/unquote
<em>"the 8 OS is like Vista and ME (Millennium Edition) all rolled into one."</em>&nbsp; Funny thing is, I had both those operating systems, AND I LIKED THEM!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can understand a huge problem that every is having trouble with, but everyone seemed to have little problems, some more than one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is, then,&nbsp; what is different between my operating system now, Windows 7 Home Premium, and Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thinking more towards a Full Retail Version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANX.........Jimmy</p>

            What exactly were you looking for in relation to an 'upgrade' ?<br />
<br />
Home Premium does just about anything a non business user needs.<br />
The only&nbsp; differences are to do with security - encryption, etc. , extended networking,<br />
and XP MODE.<br />
XP MODE can be useful for some business that have expensive software that is not compatible<br />
with Win7. XP MODE is not suitable for running 3D games, as is too often suggested.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows7/products/compare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Win7 versions comparison
</a><br />
<br />
Win 8 would be very popular among laptop and table users, but the METO interface is not<br />
much benefit to PC users ( says he who has not bothered even playing with Win8 ), but that's<br />
the market Monopoly$oft is pitching Win8 to.<br />
<br />
There never has been a Windows release that appeals to everyone, and they all have faults that<br />
attract the attention of many. The biggest fail for Win7 I am aware of is the inability to disable
<br />
Auto-arrange in folders. This function that was available with XP was very useful for many, particularly<br />
'visual' types (myself) who liked arranging their files and sub-folders in a pattern, and who now have to<br />
work within the grid of uniformity imposed by MS and it's 250+ grid arranging options.<br />
Well, I lie. I did do a 'fix' to disable Auto-arrange, but it's not as good as with XP. One problem being<br />
you can accidentally hide a folder or file if you drop one on top (*ends rant*).<br />
I've never used Libraries or AERO either, but pinning folder shortcuts to the Windows Explorer and Control Panel icons on the Task Bar is very useful, and Win7 loads faster and is very stable.

Trust me, if I could, I would continue using Windows 7 Home Premium, it is the best OS, in my opinion,&nbsp;for the money. I'm really not interested in 35 languages and bit-locker security that Ultimate has. I've learned my Windows purchasing lessons on eBay, they
 might be priced nice, but are they genuine? Most aren't, some don't even know. </p>
<p>I don't want to use an upgrade version. A simple full retail version, although more costly, is easier. Maybe if I learn how to install an OEM version.</p>

So what are you asking ? <br />
You have Win7 HP installed and know you don't need the stuff that comes with the other version,<br />
and don't want to buy from e-bay because of a deserved bad reputation for non-genuine versions<br />
of Windows.<br />
What next ? Is the Win7 HP you have installed now an illegitimate version, and you want a
<br />
genuine version ?<br />
- If you have a disk you can buy a new genuine key from MS&nbsp; and still use the old disk for re-installs,
<br />
or repairs,&nbsp; or for much&nbsp; the same price, buy a new OEM disk from a legitimate source such as New Egg.<br />
OEM versions are supposed to be restricted to system builders. Some component&nbsp; retailers here in Oz will only sell one if you buy the motherboard, others are more liberal. I don't know what NewEggs
<br />
policy is, but if you have receipts for components for your current machine you should be eligible
<br />
for an OEM copy.<br />
<br />
An OEM version installs the same as a retail&nbsp; version, but the license is good for only one machine<br />
(read - motherboard). You can re-install as many time as necessary on the one machine.<br />
A full retail version license version is good for 3 (maybe 5) machines ? (I use OEM ), but only after deactivating the current install, so you can replace the motherboard, but not sell the machine<br />
and use the key again on another machine.<br />

Boss.......</p>
<p>I will continue with my 7 Home Premium, not a thing wrong with that system. Eventually, I will get a 7 Pro.&nbsp;I didn't know&nbsp;one could purchase a genuine product key from MS yet still use a OEM dvd to install/reinstall.</p>
<p>Thanx for your answers.</p>

<h3> alexanderlehm  say:</h3>
<h2>            When can I &#39;kick off&#39; my Windows 10 installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today, Wednesday July 29th 2015, the Get Windows 10 app appeared on my taskbar. I reserved my copy, asked for a confirmation email on my Gmail account, and received the email (it just said it was a confirmation and things about it being the first time using
 that email for my windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has now been a few hours since the reservation, and I just need to know this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When and how will I receive the notification saying I can install Windows 10? How long will it take before I receive this notification?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if my laptop can't download the upgrade, then how will I know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've checked the FAQ and I've read other questions concerning Windows 10 upgrades, but I can't find anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Alex.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I am using a 32 bit Windows 8.1 laptop.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change taskbar&#47; start menu properties&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know what I've done, other than install a new video graphics driver, but now I can't change my taskbar properties or my start menu properties. All of my pinned items are gone and I can't pin any items to the taskbar, even though the option is not
 grayed out.</div>
<div>IsShortcut is there still.</div>
<div>I cannot lock the taskbar, and if I try to change any settings under properties it won't do it. Even something as simple as 'show hidden files etc.' under organize doesn't work. Take, for example, aero peek. I might disable aero peek under taskbar properties,
 but when I press 'apply' and test it, aero peek is not disabled.</div>
<div>I'll change it, and the computer will change it back again. I've literally looked everywhere, tries everything. It doesn't change anything. I tried scannow, and it came up with nothing.</div>
<div>This is a personal computer, and isn't (as far as I know anyway) under a group policy. As well as that I am the administrator.</div>
<div>I would open it in safe mode, but my laptop screen is broken and I have to use an external monitor. It means the screen is slow to load and I don't get the opportunity to open into safe mode.</div>
<div>Does anybody have ANY idea what I should do? I can't reset windows, I don't want to lose all of my files (particularly Norton), and the laptop came with windows pre-installed, so I don't have any kind of installation disk or anything.</div>
<div>I really want to get to the bottom of this.</div>
<div>Thank you for your time.</div>

            <p>If you aren't sure what triggered the problem, using this will usually get you back to a working state quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows+R to show the Run box.</li><li>Type RSTRUI and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date before the problem started happening.</li><li>Click Next.</li><li>If the problem is not resolved, you can go back to step 1 and try a different date.</li></ol>
<p>If you don't like the restore, you can always undo it - so this is by far the safest option for fixing an issue like this.</p>

            This is the usual anomaly you will see from time to time with modern Windows 10 apps. Its simply a glitch.

<br />You can file it as a bug so the engineers are aware of it:

            <p>In Win7 it is called system image.&nbsp; Access it: Start, All programs, Maintenance, Backup and restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have a failing HD and it is corrupted, you will cloning the corruption.&nbsp; Strongly recommend a clean install of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing it use Windows Easy Transfer to copy your data and settings, along with a full backup.&nbsp; Easy transfer is a great program that is built in to Win7.</p>

            Cloning and imaging are not the same thing.&nbsp; A clone is a complete copy of a hard drive made to a second hard drive, while imaging creates a large compressed copy of the drive or partition that can be retained for future use.&nbsp; There are advantages to both
 methods.&nbsp; A cloned drive can be swapped immediately, while an image must be restored, which takes time.&nbsp;&nbsp; An image, on the other hand, can be retained and used again if necessary.<br />

            <p>Forget the other posts....To clone a HD,microsoft OS already has the software installed.</p>
<p>Simply plug in new HD,once in desktop,go to run or cmd,type: diskmgmt.msc&nbsp; in msc,R.click on the</p>
<p>slave HD,delete/create a new partition/format,use default settings,once thru,exit msc.</p>
<p>In run,type:&nbsp; XCOPY C:\*.* D:\ /c/h/e/k/r</p>
<p>agree to all in the DOS window,once thru,youre finished,also D: being&nbsp; the slave HD,if asigned a</p>
<p>diffrent letter&nbsp; then use that instead.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I down loaded AOMEI and tried to clone my HDD. When clicking on the "Clone" tab, AOMEI does not list my computer HDD to be able to clone it. It does list my new HDD, but it is listed as the HDD to clone, not the destination HDD. Do I nee to upgrade to the
 paid version? I am running the FREE version.</p>
