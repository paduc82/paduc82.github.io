<h2>            Gamerscore Not Increasing</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier today, I unlocked 2 achievements on Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham for Xbox One. They are:<br />
<br />
One Small Step for (Bat)Man... 20G<br />
Hey Diddle Diddle 30G<br />
<br />
Before these 2 achievements, my total gamerscore was 272,647G.<br />
<br />
Upon unlocking One Small Step for (Bat)Man... for 20G, I realized that my total gamerscore did not increase. It stayed at 272,647G. I did a scan on Trueachievements.com, and the achievement was updated as unlocked, but like Xbox.com, there was no increase to
 the total gamerscore.<br />
<br />
Subsequently, I unlocked Hey Diddle Diddle for 30G. This time, my total gamerscore increased to 272,677 on Xbox.com. I did a scan on Trueachievements.com again, and it was updated to 272,677G as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So it seems only the earlier achievement for 20G was not properly updated. My correct total gamerscore should be 272,697G. What can I do about this?<br />
<br />
PS: If you see the gamercard on this post, it should be reading 272,647G, i.e., no increase at all. This is making me all confused.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Seeing that there's no useful help whatsoever on this forum for this, I did some googling and found a temporary solution.
</p>
<p>The problem is (as always) with the Xbox One server. I don't know what caused this, but the points are definitely stuck, somewhere. To resolve this, go to your Xbox 360, play a game, and unlock an achievement there. Any achievement will do.
</p>
<p>Unlocking an achievement on your Xbox 360 seems to force all those "stuck" points out, and your score will now be "correct" on all your devices.
</p>
<p>Just bear in mind though that the next time you unlock an achievement on the Xbox One, the issue may resurface. This is why I call this a "temporary" solution. &nbsp;</p>

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />what problems are you having with the snipping tool? You cannot natively download a new version from MS and install it. You can update windows to the latest version if you do not have 1903 and it will install an updated version of it. 
<br />
<br />If you have anymore questions, let me know.

            Hi spinlizard 
<br />
<br />The Snipping tool in Windows has been replaced with the Snip and Sketch tool, you can get that from the Microsoft Store:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/snip-sketch/9mz95kl8mr0l?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/snip-sketch/9...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair your existing Snipping tool
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type cmd
<br />
<br />From the resulting list, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />When that command completes, paste this into Command Prompt and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />When that command completes, close Command Prompt and restart (not shut down) your PC . . .

            I believe you're talking about activating Microsoft Office. If this is correct, uninstall the trial version (Control Panel&gt;Programs &amp; Features) and purchase Office from your favorite online/brick&amp;mortar store. You'll get a better price than if you purchase
 the trial version. If you really want to convert the trial version to a full license:<br />

    <title>Windows 7 System Image Error &#40;FAT32 partition&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nevastuica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 System Image Error &#40;FAT32 partition&#41;</h2>
                    I recently bought a Dell Optiplex 360, that shipped from Dell with FreeDOS on a CD. The system had already a 2GB partition marked as 'System' and formatted FAT32 (I presume for FreeDOS installation).<br />
<br />
I also purchased a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium OEM with the PC.<br />
<br />
After installing Windows 7, I tried to use the built-in System Image feature. This attempts to include both the 2GB partition and the Win7 partition in the image, but fails because the 2GB partition is formatted as FAT32.<br />
<br />
I am unable to delete / format / convert to NTFS the 2GB partition from Windows Disk Management service.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I am unable to make a system image of the newly installed PC.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to instruct Windows to include only the C: drive in the system image? How do you advise me to proceed?<br />
<br />
Any guidance would be very much appreciated.

            i assume that you are trying to install w7 on a computer with another opperating system already on it. i also assume that you are trying have your computer be a dual boot computer...that is not&nbsp;suggested without installing a partition between the 2 operating
 systems. the 2 gb files MAYBE files&nbsp;insttalled by dell to house the ability to a&nbsp;make a install disk of the opperating system already on the computer.the windows 7 home premium is a&nbsp;oem that means that you purchased the program as an end user it is not an
 up grade so it will not&nbsp;upgrade the the opperating system you purchased with the computer.(AND IT MAY VOID YOUR WARANTEE ChecK WITH DELL)if you still want to go foreward you will have to perform a clean install&nbsp;and reformat the hard drive for 2 opperating
 systems&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for taking the time to answer, but this is not the problem I have.<br />
<br />
I have Win 7 installed. The PC came with a 2GB partition already formatted as FAT32 and marked as System.<br />
The Win 7 System Image is unable to complete, because it tries to include the FAT32 partition in the backup. I have no way of telling System Image to not include that partition. I have no way of deleting the partition (everything is disabled when I click that
 partition in Disk Management console).<br />
<br />
What would be the appropriate steps to take in this situation so that I can complete my System Image?

            No, it was sent with a FreeDOS CD and the HDD had already a 2GB FAT32 partition on it.<br />
Like I said, I purchased a Win7 DVD from the retailer together with the PC.<br />
The problem is that I wasn't able to delete that partition on Win7 installation and now it's causing me problems with system image.

 is that this process could make the computer unbootable and require you to boot with the win7 dvd and repair the startup files.&nbsp; I have not worked up the courage yet.&nbsp; Please report back if you try it.<br />

            Well, I'd rather not be the guinea pig. That's one of the reasons I posted my problem in the Microsoft forums.<br />
Plus, that FAT32 partition is not assigned a drive letter, and I can't assign one in Disk Management console.

Worked for me.&nbsp; I ran convert and then rebooted.&nbsp; Mine also did not have a drive letter, but you can right-click the volume in disk management, click "change drive letter and paths..." and then click the "add" button to give it a drive letter.&nbsp; Creating a system
 image right now.&nbsp; Your other option would be to start over and reinstall windows 7, you could use the setup dvd to delete all the partitions on your drive and then use it to create just one partition to install to before beginning the installation.<br />

However, none of the solutions presented can help me in fixing my problem.<br />

I seem to be stuck with Backup and Restore trying to include that problematic partition in the System Image.

            HI!..what i am think you can do is do a clean install.. which mean you can reboot your computer with the win7 in the computer and reinstall everything... you can choose to delete all your partition by clearly choosing delete!!&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I upgraded my ASUS laptop from Windows 8.1 -&gt; Windows 10. This has been a great update by far other than when my computer screen either shuts off or goes to sleep, (Restarting is fine), I come across a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) stating video_tdr_failure...
 (igdkmd64.sys). Now I thought it was just a one time thing however this happens every time it wakes up. When the computer is active, I have no errors like these.. No errors at all. Even when playing the graphic intense games I have. I would like a little guidance
 towards a fix. I have been checking multiple forums but these suggested actions don't seem to work or at least with me personally.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did a completely fresh install of Windows 10 RTM and go this error.</p>
<p>So the drivers are uptodate.</p>
<p>So either the drivers as supplied by Microsoft are at fault or its in Windows.</p>
<p>Win 8.1 was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is a Windows 10 issue NOT Windows 8.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't an app compatibility issue as its to do with Sleep.</p>
<p>I shutdown all apps prior to initiating sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading Intel drivers etc is not an option as Windows 10 versions are not available there, last time I looked... And the device driver install model has changed.</p>

            I actually just installed new intel driver software. (Follow Step 1 &amp; 2), now I will be seeing if this update, as the drivers we were using were only in beta, will fix this.<br />

            <p>I found a temporary fix for this problem. &nbsp;It is definitely a problem with the Intel driver that is installed with Windows Update. &nbsp;The problem with Windows Update is that it will always automatically download and install updates (at least for the home version.
 &nbsp;I heard for Win10 Pro that you can disable auto-updates). &nbsp;I read the following solutions and fixes for this problem, but either they didn't work, or it wasn't a good option:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted Fix 1 - Disable Windows Update from Services - This isn't a good option because as soon as you turn it back on to install other updates, the faulty Intel driver will still install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted&nbsp;Fix 2 - Download Troubleshoot Tool from Microsoft - I went through the steps using this tool to hide the Intel update, however it continued to be downloaded and installed from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted&nbsp;Fix 3 - Registry Hack - This seemed to work for earlier builds of Windows 10. &nbsp;It would allow you to enable the Windows Update option from the legacy Control Panel. &nbsp;However, this did not work for me. &nbsp;It wouldn't allow me to make the changes needed
 in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after so much trial-and-error and thousands of restarts, I figured out what is the best solution right now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working Fix - Everyone is trying to uninstall the Intel driver that is causing the BSOD but the problem is that if you uninstall it, Windows Update will detect that and will reinstall it. &nbsp;Therefore the best option is to NOT uninstall it. &nbsp;Keep it installed
 but just use a different working version of it. &nbsp;In my case, I am using an ASUS G550JK and my working driver (Intel HD Graphics 4600) is version 10.18.10.3574 dated 4/23/2014. &nbsp;This is what you do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure your working driver was previously installed on your laptop. &nbsp;In my case to get this to happen I had to delete the driver from Device Manager and then select "Scan for Hardware Changes". &nbsp;It then proceeded to install the 4/23/2014 Intel driver.
 &nbsp;NOTE: &nbsp;Make sure that you do not Roll Back the driver.</p>
<p>2. Let Windows Update install the updated driver.</p>
<p>3. Go back to Device Manager and right click on the Intel Driver.</p>
<p>4. Click "Update Driver Software"</p>
<p>5. Choose "Browse my computer for driver software"</p>
<p>6. Choose "Let me pick from a list...."</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;You should see a list of compatible hardware. &nbsp;In my case, I see both versions of the Intel Driver. &nbsp;I then chose the working driver from 4/23/2014.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Success!! &nbsp;No more BSOD!!!!</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Windows Update will no longer be a problem because you did NOT uninstall the faulty Intel driver. &nbsp;You merely aren't using it.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;Wait until Intel (or possibly Asus in my case) comes up with an updated driver that fixes the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!<br />

<p>
</p><p>I was losing my mind and just about to give up all hope and go back to Windows 8.1. I saw this post and figured what the heck, I've got nothing else to lose. So I tried it. I even enabled the PW upon waking and it still boots back up with no hesitation now.
 Hopefully, I don't encounter any other strange problems after I lose my chance to revert back to 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tony.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this happening when you attempt to Update?  If so there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most through way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Where in Windows 10 are you seeing this error message?
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If its while attempting a backup...
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

<h2>            C00000C2 means &#38;quot&#59;Goodbye Kinect&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I got the C00000C2 error on my Kinect sensor.&nbsp; My sensor is 20 days out of warranty. It will cost $90.49 USD to replace it with a refurbished one with a 90 day warranty. I don't mistreat my things, far from it.&nbsp; I bought a lot of games for this thing.&nbsp; I'm
 on my third 360. I bought tons of 360 games NEW. To have to buy another sensor after 1 year and 20 days is ridiculous. Support's reply to it being, "That is unfortunate."&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is unfortunate that I spent a lot of money on a product that lasted a year
 and 20 days and I am so easily written off.&nbsp;So I'm supposed to buy a new Kinect&nbsp;after 1&nbsp;year?&nbsp; I can't afford that so I say goodbye to Kinect and all the games I would have bought for it.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun the short time it lasted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>When such errors occur, usually reinstalling or doing a repair installation is the best choice of action. However, we can try to repair these files and check if it helps. To do so, refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open the start screen and type "</span><strong><span>cmd</span></strong><span>"</span></li><li>
<span>Right click on the command prompt and click on "</span><strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong><span>".</span></li><li>
<span>Type the following commands and hit enter after each.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you run these commands, restart the system and check.</span></span></p>

<p>Sad! Been down for 48 hours. It has to be tied to our gamer tags. I just wish 343 or MS will address the problem.</p>

<h2>            BSOD when printing</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>everytime i try to print into a pdf program (Fineprint) my PC BSODs. I tried to look into the kernel dump files and it seems like its something with the ntoskrnl.exe. Tried to open it with WinDbg but it seems like there's a problem with symbols than i cant
 seem to fix, even if i download the symbols from the MS URL (http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres a link to the .dmp files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hkEblY8a7yf8FOR5LRaVR25CL5f48GFQ?usp=sharing</p>

<br />
The manufacturer of a product is responsible for all product support for said product no matter what operating system you choose to run.&nbsp; However, it is also their choice what operating systems they support - so if you choose to utilize an operating system
 they do not support...&nbsp; you end up&nbsp;on the losing end.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Looking on the Wacom web pages (US and Asia so far) - your device was supported under Windows 7 last.&nbsp; You might try downloading the Windows 7 device drivers/software and installing them using Compatibility Mode for Windows 7 under Windows 8.&nbsp; There is no guarantee
 of the results and your first point of support contact for the Bamboo Pen (CTL-460) is still Wacom.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
US web site:<br />
<a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/support/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wacom.com/en/support/drivers</a><br />
[Select "Bamboo Pen"&nbsp;--&gt; "Windows 7"]<br />
<br />
Asian web site:<br />
<a href="http://www.wacom-asia.com/download/download_index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wacom-asia.com/download/download_index.html</a><br />
[Select "English" --&gt; "Bamboo Pen (CTL-460)" --&gt; "Windows 7" and click on "Search"]<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The US site has the newer drivers [<a href="http://cdn.wacom.com/u/productsupport/drivers/win/consumer/PenTablet_5.2.5-5a.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Driver 5.2.5-5a(RC) for Windows 7, Vista &amp; XP (32 &amp; 64 bit versions)</a>] and that one is probably your best bet. Save it to your
 computer, <a href="http://www.forumswindows8.com/tutorials/windows-8-compatibility-mode-5264.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
change the compatibility on the EXE file to "Windows 7"</a> and then run it to try and install the driver in a compatibility mode. The results can be anywhere from failure to some success to full functionality. IN the end - if Wacom doesn't have a Windows 8
 driver out for the device - your winging it.

    <title>Windows 10 to Windows 10 Pro Upgrade Failed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 10 Pro Upgrade Failed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been trying to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, and experiencing some issues.</p>
<p>Here's my Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP Envy M4 Laptop</li><li>Intel i7-3632QM @ 2GHz</li><li>Running 64-Bit Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>I have payed for the upgrade, and when I begin the install (Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security-&gt;Activation-&gt;Go To Store), everything appears to run perfectly fine. The data is downloaded up to 100% with little to no delays. The computer restarts as expected. Then,
 it prompts me to log in as normal. When I do so, it seems to get hung up on something and take a long time to load my profile. It then proceeds to a black screen for a few minutes. Afterward, it shows my desktop and gives me the following error dialog:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82f85826-f2d7-4c45-9692-69ffd22874d0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the grammatical error... I was very puzzled by this error message. It does not give any error code whatsoever, and I am unsure what System Administrator that the dialog could be referring to. I am using my own personal computer, and am connected
 to the wifi of a college campus, but I don't believe that any Campus Administrator would be an appropriate System Administrator to contact on this issue. In attempting to contact Microsoft, I was lead here. If somebody could refer me to an e-mail address that
 I could send a message to, that would be very helpful.</p>
<p>In the mean time, if somebody has any suggestions or solutions, I would be open to trying almost anything. My only concern is that this is the only place that I have most of my data stored, so I need to keep my HDD in working condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for your Time,</p>
<p>-Tom</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank You for the response.</p>
<p>I apologize for not being specific enough in the original post, but I am upgrading from WINDOWS 10 HOME to WINDOWS 10 PRO, so the link that you referred me to was not very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I first posted this, I have also tried deleting the Temporary update files in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download. That did not solve the issue, as I still receive the same error after the automatic system reboot.</p>
<p>I am also unable to find any sort of built-in Windows Update Troubleshooter, so I am unable to use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further suggestions please respond, and I would be willing to try them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>
<p>-Tom</p>

            <p>So, after directly getting in contact with a Microsoft Representative, and examining the situation, a solution was reached.</p>
<p>I had to do a clean install of Windows 10 on my computer. This, unfortunately, involved backing up all of my data and restoring my Laptop to factory settings. This brought it down to Windows 8.0, so I had to go through the process of upgrading to Windows
 8.0.6 in order to get to Windows 8.1, and then finally, I could request a new activation code for my Copy of Windows 10. After receiving the code a few days later, and upgrading to Windows 10 Home, I immediately began the Windows 10 Pro install through the
 Windows Store. This time, instead of simply returning me to the login screen after restarting, my computer began using the normal windows updater and says "Getting Windows Ready X%". After a few restarts, I was informed that my edition had been properly upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure exactly what caused this issue, but I know that this process should only be used as a last resort, as it takes a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the Continued Support, Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Refusing to give pro-rated refund - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nhurst1369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refusing to give pro-rated refund</h2>
                    
<p>I cancelled my X-box live membership back in June because I only used it to stream content which I no longer need. &nbsp;According to the Live FAQ:<br />
<span>http://xbox.com/livefaq</span></p>
<span>http://xbox.com/livefaq</span></p>
<p>I can get a pro-rated refund for this. &nbsp;But first Microsoft sent me an email saying my refund was denied with no reason given, just a link to the FAQ. &nbsp;Then when calling customer support, first they said I wasn't eligible because I started my membership
 back in January. &nbsp;But after referring them to the FAQ which clearly states that isn't the case, they tried to just offer 6 months of free X-box live credit. &nbsp;Which I clearly don't want. &nbsp;So now I just have to wait (and keep checking the status page) to see
 if they will actually give my money back or not. &nbsp;This whole thing reminds me of how Comcast does business, by first denying all requests and then making it as difficult as possible to actually get the deal offered. &nbsp;And offering deals for less than promised
 each time you contact them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had an experience like this? &nbsp;Has anyone actually got a pro-rated refund from Microsoft for the pre-purchased live membership?</p>
<p>Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>They didn't include any fine print, only the reference to the FAQ which states I should get a refund......</p>
<p>My x-box live account was setup for automatic payment plus I purchase other things through the x-box store so they have payment information on file. &nbsp;And which would be proof of purchase. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The email simply said "We have evaluated your request and it has been denied for non-compliance with one or more of the policies listed at
<a href="http://xbox.com/livefaq&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/livefaq"</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It would have been nice if they listed the reason, but neither the email or customer service when I called them could provide me with one. &nbsp;How can you send a denial email and not even list a reason? &nbsp;Terrible customer service. &nbsp;</p>

<p>They can only say sorry we cannot help you or no refund they can't tell you what you failed or what info is missing</p>
<p>As it is against the law to give private info to not a owner of an account</p>
<p>Saying yes you got this wrong means next time the person calls he can try again and know which one he failed that's phishing for info if it's not the person who should know that info</p>

<p>I didn't fail validation, they verified that I owned the account. &nbsp;They claimed that they didn't know why my request had been denied, not that they couldn't tell me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is more has anyone else been able to cancel their x-box live membership and get the pro-rated portion refunded to them? &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's possible that your computer might have been infected by a malware. Kindly go to Task Manager&gt; Processes&gt; svchost.exe&gt; right click and then select Properties. The location should identify that is it's coming from your operating system like the picture
 below.</p>

<br />
Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is responsible for crashing your system or that the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers belong
 to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help you
 investigate this further. <br />

<p>Installed Window 7 from MSDN.&nbsp; Installed on my laptop.&nbsp; I can not see the screen at the "recommended"(1900x1200) screen resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who the heck can see anything at&nbsp;that resolution?&nbsp; Just 12 year olds I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I use the slider bar in display settings to try to adjust to a resolution that would cause less strain on my eyes.&nbsp; Instead of changing the resolution it just shrinks the entire screen with huge black boarders all around... and I still can't see anything.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So far the verdict for Windows 7 is ____!&nbsp; Wish I would have stuck with Vista.&nbsp; This problem is something that should have been identified and fixed in the beta version.</p>

<br />
It is in the "nVidia's control panel".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select "Change Flat Panel Scaling".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Under &nbsp;"When using a resolution lower than my&nbsp;display's native resolution...".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Change default&nbsp;from "Use Display's Scaling" to "Use nVidia's Scaling".<br />

    <title>Is there any way to regain administrator privileges after upgrading - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there any way to regain administrator privileges after upgrading from windows 8 to 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    When I received my machine, it was running Windows 8. I used a local administrator account to keep things simple.
<div>After updating to 8.1, I tried to save a file in the System32 Directory. I received an error message that said I needed Administrator permissions to access that directory.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That being said, how can I become an administrator again?</div>

            I seem to have lost my local administrative privileges also. I tried to update a program which was installed on windows8 pro 64 and now that I have updated my windows to 8.1, I have no administrative privileges to do anything it seems.

            Hi Ben<br />
I have all the ownerships and permissions except for "special permissions". There is no way I can enable those special permissions either.
<br />
I know I last installed this program before the 8.1 upgrade (Windows 8 Pro) and never had an issue at all. It seems now I cannot even reinstall the same program as it claims I am not an administrator. There is one profile on this machine since a clean install
 and it is a local account with all administrator privileges. Now my Hauppauge TV card is without software to run and nobody has proper permission to install it either. Something says "Software Glitch" and I'm not very happy about it at all.<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
<br />
I uninstalled each windows updates 1 at a time right back until when 8.1 upgrade was installed with no difference at all in the administrative powers at all. This was something which happened when the upgrade was installed. I had the common sense to clone my
 drive and leave it as a working windows 8 backup drie. I switched to that drive, copied the Hauppauge instal update file to that drive and guess what?? It works flawlessly and installed without a problem.
<br />
I've not installed anything since before the 8.1 update so I guess this has been going on for a while now and not noticed, virus updates never had troubles at all and things seemed to be working fine. I still have no idea why it states that I have full administrator
 privileges yet I am denied those privileges when trying to instal a program (that installs flawlessly in Windows 8.0 pro).<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure your UserName that has Ownership and Full Control shows up both in the first window that opens when you click "Security", and the Advanced page...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems to me that I may have had to Delete one of the systems users as well...</p>
<p>I guess because it was higher up on the list, and blocking stuff before it got to my UserName...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have had several files Deny Access on the first try, and after hitting Continue, everything worked the 2nd try...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I tried to access C:\Windows\TEMP, I was denied access... I went to the Security Tab, and it was blank except for "Advanced" at the bottom...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I went to Advanced it was also blank except for a Denied Message of some type, and a "Continue" button... After clicking the button, all of the Owners\Users appeared...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After all of this I was then allowed to re-open the folder the next try...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Prior to upgrading to Win 8.1, I had taken Ownership of the entire C:\ drive, but the upgrade process seems to have altered the Permissions on a select number of files....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did take ownership of C:\ again, but some of the files didn't get changed...</p>

            I am owner of all drives and the computer states that I am the admin of the machine however it says i need to log-in as admin to instal a program. I am logged in as the admin (only 1 account on this machine). I even tried making another administrator account
 and logging into that new non-corrupt profile with full ownership of the install program only to have the same denial of administration powers. It works fine in windows 8.0 pro as it should.<br />

<p>"Computer Configuration"..."Windows Settings"..."Security Settings"..."Local Policies"... "Security Options"</p>

<p>Scroll to the bottom of the window and you will see a number of "User Account Control" settings.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can only think to "Take Ownership" of the entire C:\ drive from "This PC"... accessing it any other way may not provide the needed results...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you take ownership, make sure you check the box "Replace Owner on all Subcontainers and Objects"... It is located directly under where the Owner is listed at the top of the window...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the last thing to do before hitting "Apply" as the option probably won't even appear until you have selected the new Owner...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even if you have taken Ownership before, if this step didn't get done, changing ownership won't solve the problem..</p>

            I got it fixed finally. I had to clone my virgin windows 8.0 drive and then re-download the 8.1 update once again (wish a disk could have been easier to do). A note on update to 8.1 is that if another drive is on the machine, it will fail with error code
 0x80073b92 0x20009. Disconnect all drives except the drive to be updated and it works flawlessly.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That's interesting to know... Win 7 and newer is funny that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you fresh install Win 7 or newer on a machine with more than one drive, or even an extra partition, and then later remove or delete it, Windows won't boot...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems as though it hides a boot file or something, and when it then isn't there, it won't boot...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It sounds like you had the opposite problem.</p>

            <div>Hi Tracyp37,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Do you remember making any recent changes to your computer after which this issue has started to occur?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try booting your computer in Safe Mode and check if Windows loads successfully without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts </span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information to boot into Safe Mode, see:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, l<span>et’s put the computer in clean boot state and check if any third-party program is causing this issue.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s&nbsp;an article you may refer to, for steps with reference to the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Use this link if you are using Windows XP:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned here:</span></p>
<p><b><span>To configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;</span><span>Click <span>Start</span>, and then click <span>Run</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;</span><span>Type msconfig, and then click <span>OK</span>. The <span>
System Configuration Utility</span> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;</span><span>Click the <span>General</span> tab, click <span>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;</span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</span></p>
