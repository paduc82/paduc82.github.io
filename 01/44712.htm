<h2>            WindowLiveMail contacts file location&#47;Deletion &#38; Replacement</h2>
                    OK, start with the basics. &nbsp;I <b>NEVER </b>logon to Windows Live Mail; my experience is that it totally kluges my contacts; I end up with many duplicates and the online eliminate dups tool, is under powered, searches only for identical names, choses same
 names, different email addresses etc. &nbsp;It's also infernally slow, only does a few at a time. &nbsp;So, I NEVER logon, so my question has only to do with the WLMail client on my PC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FWIW, I am running: &nbsp;Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3508.0205)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I understand that the WLMail contacts file is under C: ... Users... *.edb (found this in an old thread.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have historical issues with many duplicates in my contacts list which I have
<b>laboriously </b>manually removed.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, I had to have my hard drive wiped and Windows 7 and WLMail re-installed. &nbsp;Apparently the WLMail contacts file kept all the duplicates names that I eliminated (but must mark them in some way so they don't display). &nbsp;So, when my computer service
 re-loaded the contacts file, all the duplicates reappeared. &nbsp;I went from about 1,200 contacts to 5,000+</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought that I was cleaning these up in a file located at: &nbsp;C:\Users\Owner\Contacts &nbsp;but none of the changes show in WLMail - and I now think that this is probably the location of the Windows contacts but not the WLMail contacts. &nbsp;(They do not synch
 and can't be substituted for each other &lt;learned this from other threads).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>all the *.edb files on my machine appear to be under the various user names, but have a file name like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;WLCalendarStore.edb &nbsp;<b>Is this a problem? &nbsp;</b>I may have created a problem in marking my ?WLMail contacts file to share with all the logons
 on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I <i>think </i>I want to delete all the contacts in WLMail and import the contacts from this other (probably) Windows contacts file).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, a couple question:</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;My contact files don't contain a ton of extra information, some with two emails per name, a very few phone numbers, a very few with a mailing address. &nbsp;<b>Will all this carry over - particularly the names? &nbsp;</b>I read some threads that suggested importing
 from Windows contacts drops all the names; &nbsp;that would be really ugly!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Within WLMail if I select all of the contacts (after backing up, of course) and delete them - are they really gone ...or just marked not to display. &nbsp;I read some threads that suggested that they magically reappear. &nbsp;I don't want that to happen. &nbsp;I
 supposed I could delete all the .edb files<b>.</b></div>
<div><b>What is the best way to truly delete all the contacts from WLMail? &nbsp;Will they really be gone?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Is there a better way to do this?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
<div>PS: &nbsp;after writing this I looked at my backup in the cloud (which has not been updated since computer repair. &nbsp;Rather than the *.edb file I was expecting; I found two files: &nbsp;edbres00001.jrs &amp; edbres00002.jrs. &nbsp;Now I'm wondering if these are the WLMail
 contact files - altho both have along ago "Date modified" dates. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I also see files named like this in my pc with very recent "Date Modified" dates. &nbsp;However they appear in several strings: &nbsp;C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars\DBStore\LogFile</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars\<i>&lt;my email address&gt;</i>\DBStore\LogFiles</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>So, to be successful about this do I have to delete ALL of these? &nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FWIW: I would prefer if Under the category Microsoft account, Outlook.com, Skydrive there was a Windows Live Mail Product 'choice' so the separation would be clearer than 'Mail' which is too broad a category.</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you're having issues within your contacts in Windows Live Mail. I will assist you on your inquiries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, it is not advisable to use the .EDB file as the way to import your contacts. Note that .EDB file is being used by the program internally. Possible issues may occur if you manually extract the .EDB file from Windows Live Mail to a different program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For your first question, yes. Contact information should be carried over in case you're using the .CSV files to import.&nbsp;<span>To know more on how to import and export e-mails, please check this
</span><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>link</b></a>.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>For your second question, once you have deleted contacts, it should be deleted. In case you receive an error or, sees a misbehavior within the program, we request that you submit the information to us so we can further investigate your concern.
 As mentioned before, we do not recommend deleting .EDB files unless there was an investigation conducted within our end.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, we appreciate that your suggesting to create a separate category for Windows Live Mail. You can provide your feedback and requests within this
<a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>link</b></a>. Microsoft will review these types of posts and, can be used as future reference.</span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>If you have other concern on Windows Live Mail, please let us know. We'll be here to provide assistance.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></div>

            Ceasar, thank you for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>If I understand you correctly. &nbsp;If I go in and delete all my contacts in WLMail - they will go 'away' and I don't have to worry about them reappearing and merging with the cleaned up imported contact list.</div>
<div><b>is that correct?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>2. &nbsp;I understand that you don't recommend 'messing' with the edb*.jrs files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Would you expect that with the deletion of my contacts in WLMail that the file size on these would drop to near zero from their current 2Mb &amp; 4Mb sizes?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>and if they don't shrink in size what then?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>3. &nbsp;You didn't answer specifically, if I import the cleaned up set of contacts from what I think is the Windows Contacts file
<b>Do you expect a 'clean' import with no lost data?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Thanks again for your support.</div>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the answers to your queries below: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Yes, if&nbsp;you go in and delete all&nbsp;your contacts in WLMail - they will go 'away' and&nbsp;you don't have to worry about them reappearing and merging with the cleaned up imported contact list but you need to delete also what is on your people.live.com (contacts).&nbsp;
 If you are importing the contacts it should be in a csv file and before you delete it make sure that you have a back up of the original contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font>2. Yes we should not mess up with these files for it does not pertain specifically on the contact. When EDB file get corrupted, the users are unable to access their emails, calendar, contacts and other vital information from his/her mailbox and
 the .jrs (reserve transaction log) files are used when transaction information needs to be written to the transaction log but the disk has run out of space preventing this from happening.&nbsp; The .jrs files are created in advance and exist to hold transaction
 log information in anticipation of the out-of-disk space scenario.</font>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>3. Are you referring to the contacts in C:\Users\Owner\Contacts? What is the file format of&nbsp;this file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other concerns, please notify us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Use this tutorial :</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I recommend that you install 7-zip.<br />
It is widely used and highly recommended. I personally use it exclusively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/download.html</a><br />
<br />
Note : there is one download for 32-bit, and one for 64-bit. Make sure you pick the right one.<br />

    <title>Run Program&#47;Application that Prompts a User at Logoff in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyyzzeus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run Program&#47;Application that Prompts a User at Logoff in Windows 7 or Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This is a backup application that prompts the user when they logoff if they wish to perform a backup or not.&nbsp; It's intended when the person leaves work.&nbsp; But if the person wishes to reboot, or just logoff, to do a switch user, the person may not want to
 wait for the backups to be completed; for example low battery on a laptop. The prompt is very simple. It has a 30seconds timer, with a "yes" &amp; "no" buttons. If the timer expires, or the person clicks the "yes" button, the backup will be performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows XP, the prompt appears.&nbsp; Once the backup finishes, or skipped if the user clicked "no", the computer will logoff or shutdown.&nbsp; With Windows 7 and Windows 10, the application does not appear.&nbsp; but the logoff splash screen appears immediately
 and it sits there waiting the full 30 seconds plus how ever long the backup takes.&nbsp; Reviewing the backup logs, the backups are always performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup application is called by "gpedit.msc";&nbsp; --- "Local Computer Policy"; --- "User Configuration", --- "Windows Settings", --- "Scripts (Logon/Logoff)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we change the Windows 7 and Windows 10 characteristics to actually show the application and not get hidden by the logoff splash screen? Because it works as expected in Windows XP.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay response, was on business travel. Last night we attempted to run a "clean boot" mode and again, the Windows 10 Logoff splash screen is covering our popup.<br />
</p>
<p>We also did a clean installation using&nbsp; VirtualBox and we now have screenshots.&nbsp; Again we attempted the "clean boot" mode and nothing.&nbsp; I'm including the screen shots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is an example of our PCBackup popup where we ran it manually.&nbsp; It's a simple yes or no, with a timer.&nbsp; If the timer expires, the backup is performed. Be aware that under Windows XP Pro SP3 and Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, the icons disappear and the background
 screen turns into simple solid color.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ddc33a-beff-4502-b0c3-8dc5748b8673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ddc33a-beff-4502-b0c3-8dc5748b8673" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is what happens under Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1511 build 10586).&nbsp; When we disable the logoff script, the logoff splash screen stays on for a handful of seconds.&nbsp; When we enable the logoff script, logoff splash screen stays on for no less than 30 seconds,
 plus however long the backups take.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37dfd76f-70e7-42be-a0aa-9374a9ae4f82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37dfd76f-70e7-42be-a0aa-9374a9ae4f82" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on our PCBackup logs, I know it runs successfully.&nbsp; Problem is that I no longer have the option to skip the backup.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing us back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Go to start button and type in the search, file history.</p>
<p>b. Choose the "Turn Off" button in the "Keep a History of Your Files" section. You may need to provide your administrator credentials before disabling the backup feature.</p>
<p>c. Reboot the computer and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>It's already disabled.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: I do appreciate the help, but I'm trying to understand what the last two instructions have to do with the logoff splash screen.&nbsp; I believe the challenge or the objective is that Windows should not show the splash screen until the backup is complete,
 like in Windows 7 or XP.<br />
</p>
<p>By not showing the splash screen immediately, it gives the user the ability to select [yes] or [no].</p>

    <title>can scan to laptop, but not print to Multifunction printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimgreen750  say:</h3>
<h2>            can scan to laptop, but not print to Multifunction printer</h2>
                    
<p>This is in an office environment. Lenovo laptop running Win7 32-bit. The Brother MFC-495cw printer/scanner is connected to the laptop via a USB cable. The latest printer drivers are on the laptop.</p>
<p>We can scan from the printer to the laptop.</p>
<p>When the USB cable is plugged into any USB port on the laptop, the drivers for the printer, scan, and fax are loaded.</p>
<p>But when we try to print from the laptop to the multi-function printer, the laptop cannot&nbsp;find it.</p>
<p>We went to the Brother web site and downloaded a firmware upgrade. The upgrade program, nor can the web site, see the printer.</p>
<p>Firewall settings on the laptop are set to allow outgoing prints.</p>
<p>There are no error messages. The popup notification that says how many items are pending in the printqueque, always say zero items waiting to print. Test page from the printer properties doesn't print, no printing from any computer program on the laptop.</p>
<p>When the laptop was running WinXP, it printed to the same printer with no issues.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what we may have missed ? Any fixes ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>I suggest disconnecting the printer from the laptop, powering off the laptop, disconnecting the battery for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Reconnect the battery, reconnect&nbsp;the&nbsp;printer and see if you are able to print.</p>

            Hi Aseo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Version 1809 has been withdrawn.  You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and wait until it is re-released.  
<br />
<br />If you're still not ready to install it then you can  hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair it first, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also re-register the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> lmeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sys. WebForms.PageRequestManagerServerErrorException&#58; An unknown error occurred while processing the request on the server.  The status code returned from the server was&#58; 500</h2>
                    I tried to order a retail item online and after having filled in my details (name, phone, password) I then pressed the 'continue' button to go to the checkout, a box appeared with the following message:
<div>Sys. WebForms.PageRequestManagerServerErrorException: An unknown error occurred while processing the request on the server. &nbsp;The status code returned from the server was: 500</div>
<div>I tried looking this up on the internet but was given technical answers which mean nothing to me. &nbsp; Can I fix this and if so how? &nbsp;And, if it is not a serious problem should I just leave it (I've been able to find the item in a local shop so do not need
 the online service now) ? &nbsp;My laptop (toshiba satellite) is working fine and I've run a full scan which has come back with no threats/viruses. &nbsp;The version of Windows I have installed is version 7. &nbsp;I have already spoken at length with a computer technician
 who I gave permission to 'remote-control' my computer and she found lots of viruses in the registry. &nbsp;She informed me that I would have to pay £99 to fix the problem. &nbsp;I declined her offer but she did make me question whether I should clean the registry. &nbsp;When
 I went to the help and support page of windows, it says that the registry should run fine by itself and that it is rare for files to become corrupt. &nbsp;I have decided to leave well alone and not fix what may not be broken. &nbsp;I would still appreciate any feedback
 or any clarification.</div>

<div>1. I'm referring to the Clarks Shoes (UK) website. &nbsp;When I finish typing my details (name tel.no. email and password) I click the continue button to go to the checkout and that's when the message box appears with the heading:&nbsp;<b>The page at https//www.clarks.co.uk

<div>

<div>2. I am not using internet explorer. I am using google.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Yes I am able to access other websites successfully although I haven't tried to purchase recently apart from this pair of shoes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As per your recommendation, I am running the microsoft security scanner at the moment.</div>

            First thing....stay away from any registry cleaners! The can do more harm than good. If you suspect you may have a virus/malware, have a look at this site for some good information and instructions.<br />
<a href="http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide/</a><br />
<br />
It actually sounds like the web page itself may have had an issue. If your computer is running fine and you don't have any issues with other web pages then I wouldn't worry about it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>I am trying to look on transitchicago.com/traintracker and this error pops up.

<p>I am also having a problem when a page opens up and it is placed in the background of the website where I can not read the content but can see a little of it. (It is being blocked from by the front part of the page.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using IE 10 and have followed the suggestions you gave in replying to the question the first time. with the optimizer and clean up. I also used the Fix It program on Microsoft support.

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>if your website is using .NET Framework 3.5&nbsp; it will Error </p>
<p>if your web site is using .NET Frameworks 4 or 4.5 it good </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this tells me I have to </p>
<ol>
<li>update my Server OS from windows 2003 to an newer version</li><li>insert VS2012&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;update my Website&nbsp; Framework to 4.0 or 4.5</li><li>&nbsp;Download Ajax 4.0 or 4.5 </li></ol>
<p>That sound like a fun day or two or three </p>

<p>I hope my company&nbsp; will not get IE10 for a little bit so I can find a few days to fix all this</p>

<p>A suggestion is to reset the console to factory settings.<br />
Before doing so, make sure of a few things.<br />
Here's a list:<br />
The information for your profile/profiles are up to date and you know email/password for each/all of them.<br />
There is a backup connection to a network, i.e. HotSpot, or hardwire connection (Ethernet)<br />
Make sure to select Keep My Games and Apps<br />
This soft factory reset is performed by accessing the Settings.<br />
It shouldn't have to do with the username, but give this a shot.<br />
Let us know if there is more we can do for you!</p>

<div>You can selectively disable individual startup items and eventually find the culprit.&nbsp; If you have Windows Desktop Search installed, go to Control Panel | Filtering options and disable it from indexing WinMail.&nbsp; Also if you have a mail gadget
 on the sidebar, remove that.&nbsp; Antivirus software can screw things up also, see<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a></div>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I suggest you to run the
<strong>Power Troubleshooter</strong> that you can find from
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt;
<strong>Power</strong> Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Press the '<strong>Windows</strong>' key and the '<strong>R</strong>' key from your keyboard and type '<strong>Devmgmt.msc</strong>'
 without the quotes and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Expand the '<strong>Display adapters</strong>' section &gt;
<strong>Right Click</strong> on the driver &gt; click on
<strong>Update Driver</strong> &gt; click on '<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>' and proceed with the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> and search for
<strong>CMD</strong> &gt; <strong>
Right click</strong> on <strong>CMD</strong> and click on
<strong>Run As Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type '<strong>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes</strong>' without quotes and hit Enter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: <strong>
Restart</strong> the PC once for the changes to take effect and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4</strong>: If the issue still persists, then try to "Disable Hybrid Sleep Mode" by following the steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open <strong>
Control Panel</strong> from the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and open
<strong>Power Options</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on
<strong>Change plan</strong> <strong>
settings</strong> next to the power plan that you want to disable hybrid sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on '<strong>Change advanced power settings'</strong> and click '<strong>Change settings that are
 currently unavailable'</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Set <strong>
Allow hybrid sleep</strong> under <strong>
Sleep</strong> to Off and then click <strong>
Ok</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, let us know if you are seeing the keyboard's backlight when you have plugged in the power cord to the laptop while hibernate mode is turned on and get back to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did Method 1</p>
<p>In method 2, the latest drivers had already been installed</p>
<p>I did method 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>In method 4, Allow hybrid sleep was already set to off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the above solved my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that when the laptop is plugged in and I hibernate, no blinking happens. However, once I unplug it, the laptop still hibernated, the blinking reappears</p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you hibernate your laptop, the Power LED will be still turned on as well as the keyboard's backlight. The Power LED will only be turned off if the laptop is completely shutdown. So, if you want the keyboard's backlight to be turned off when you hibernate
 the laptop, first turn off your keyboard's backlight when you are using the laptop and then hibernate your laptop. In that way, when you hibernate the laptop, the keyboard's backlight will be turned off; however, the Power LED is still blinking during hibernation
 because this is just a warning that your system is not turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.</p>

</p><p>I'm afraid that's not the case, because prior to the October 2018 Update, my laptop led and keyboard backlit would all turn off when I hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even if I turn off the keyboard's backlight before hibernating, they would still blink, and my battery is drainig to zero</p>

<p>For anyone else having this problem, here's how I managed to fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Right-click on battery icon, power options, change plan settings, advanced power settings, restore defaults.<br />
Then under Sleep, set "allow wake timers" to "disable" for both battery and plugged in.</div>
<div>
<p>Apply &amp; test to see if problem fixed.</p>

<p><del>this is not solve-able (the part about blinking power led, sorry about ur back light)</del></p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>i think it worked! my computer has hdd so waking from sleep takes awhile like turning on. but it appears to have woken from sleep without the LED flashing!</p>
<p>i think i missed setting the plugged-in hybrid sleep.&nbsp; why in god;s name does changing a "plugged in setting " turn off the led while sleeping?</p>
<p>i ... i don't understand. microsoft has so many resoureces they could put one of their interns to&nbsp; make a little panel that explictily controls the LED on a device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>idk... i'm glad this backdoor method exists but i dont understand why led flashing during unpluged sleep is being affected by these seemingly unrelated settings. i would guess bad design. careless implementation. but what do i know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>original post continues below...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>like the microsoft guy said. the light stays on because it's a warning that the system isn't turned off. idk. usually don't need the warning but i guess they know we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>there might be a button in the bios for night time led lights. i dont expect my bios to have these. idk why you think hybrid sleep or defaults in the power plan do this. i will restore my own settings there. nothing speaks about blinking leds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will simply park my laptop against a wall when i sleep while it's sleeping. pitch black room... that tiny led starts to look like a strobe light.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> luis haroldo freitas de figueiredo  say:</h3>
<h2>            JSCRIPT.Dll call to DllRegisterServer resulting in error code 0x80004005</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an ASUS K53A model Laptop, with 8GB of RAM, Windows 7 64-bits Home Premium operational system and no external virus control program, such as McAfee or anything. I use the Windows firewall and Windows Essentials for defence.</p>
<p>Now, my problem started when I tried to load one WMV&nbsp;flie on Windows Media Player. It opened a setup window, I checked recommended settings and the next windows (Library) opened and then crashed. Clicking again at the WMV file and an error message appears:
 "Server execution failed". </p>
<p>Well, I used Windows Fix many times: it didn't work. Then I uninstalled the media programs and installed them again at "Turn Windows Programs on and off". No use.</p>
<p>Then I went to Command Prompt as administrator, and typed:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32&gt;regsvr32 jscript.dll</p>
<p>I used this because Windows Fix always says that jscript.dll was corrupted after I used it to make Windows Media Player work.</p>
<p>The result was an error window that says that JSCRIPT.DLL was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer resultied in error code 0x80004005</p>
<p>Then I used:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</p>
<p>No use.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32&gt;sfc /scanfile=c:\windows\system32\jscript.dll</p>
<p>It says that the file has no integrity problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running out of options to make Windows Media Player work. Please help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LH.</p>

<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Remove Third-Party Codecs</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main causes of WMP (Windows Media Player) problems is the use of third party codecs that you might have installed on your computer. If you installed any codec, uninstall it from your computer and check WMP again.</p>

<p><strong><span>Method 2: Add Windows Service to the Administrators Group</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granting the Windows Local Service account administrative rights might also fix the problem. The instructions for this procedure are below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Start and type cmd.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-Click on cmd and select “Run as administrator”.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Command Prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:</p>

<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart Windows and test Windows Media Player.</p>

            <p>Hello, I tried the two methods you have given me, thank you. Nevertheless, none of them worked, and I recovered my system to see if it could run Windows Media Player with its primary configurations and programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the symptoms you provided, it sounds like the IPv6 is enabled on your WiFi adapter which causes the network issues you're experiencing. To resolve your concern, let's disable the IPv6 on your Windows 10 device and check if it works. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, and then click
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>View your active networks </strong>area, click
<strong>Local Area Connection</strong>, and then click <strong>

    <title>DLLHOST.exe taking up all RAM at random instance. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DLLHOST.exe taking up all RAM at random instance.</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Ultimate and 4 gigs of RAM on a Dell Inspiron 530 computer. Just a few minutes ago, I was watching YouTube and I clicked the Start button because I wanted to do something. The computer then went nuts. The start button flashed several times
 then froze, Firefox froze, and the screen went black and white for a few seconds. I opened task manager and killed everything, but it was still extremely slow. CPU and Memory usage were at an all time high, (I think CPU was 60, Mem was around 100). I then
 ticked the Show all processes option and found out that DLLHOST.exe was using 4,000,000 k of memory. What the heck is DLLHOST.exe, why does it use so much memory, and is it essential? Can I get rid of it? Why does it open so randomly?

            First, you may try the Printer troubleshooter, which will attempt to automatically diagnose and fix your problem.<br />
<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />
<br />
If Windows can't detect a printer that you want to use, follow these steps to find and add the printer manually:<br />
<br />
1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.<br />
2. Click Add a printer.<br />
3. In the Add Printer wizard, select Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.<br />
4. On the Searching for available printers page, click The printer that I want isn't listed.<br />
5. On the Find a printer by name or TCP/IP address page, choose how to find the printer that you want to use, based on the type or location of the printer, and then click Next.<br />
6. Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.<br />
<br />
To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check to see if the network is working correctly. For more information, see View the status of your network.<br />
<br />
I’d also suggest you to refer the link below and follow the steps mentioned in the article to troubleshoot network printer problems:<br />

<p>Thank You, Mike,</p>
<p>I know microsoft doesn't write the programs for Epson, but when I contacted Epson, they uninstalled the scan program and reinstalled it. It shows it is working properly. But when I click the icon it does not open. Epson said it was a problem with Microsoft's
 program.</p>
<p>I will let you know if I find a solution in your answer.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p><span>Hi<span>Sarah</span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to completely uninstall&nbsp;</span><span>Epson
 printer and scaner drivers completely from both programs and features and device manager. Later reinstall the Epson drivers and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall Audio drivers from programs and features, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
 on Start</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the start Search box type ‘appwiz.cpl’ and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the list select Epson.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right
 click on it and you should see the option to uninstall the program.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
 on uninstall and it should remove the program from your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the Audio drivers from device manager. While uninstalling the device from the device manager, make
 sure you follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on Start.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Access Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Device Manager and click on View.</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select Imaging device and expand it.</span></p>
<p><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select the</span><span>Epson</span><span>
 and uninstall the device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While uninstalling the device, make sure you place a check mark against "Delete the driver software for this device".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and reinstall the Epson drivers and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also try to use Windows Scan and check if it detects scanner and it it works. Access the link below and follow the steps to
 scan using Windows Scan. </span></p>

<p>Thank you, Srinivas for the suggestions.</p>
<p>I did what you suggested but I had no results.&nbsp; As I said before, epson did a check on the printer and the scanner for my all in one printer.</p>
<p>It showed them working properly. They said it was a microsoft problem. My computer is sony, so I contacted them, they thought it was an Epson issue.</p>
<p>I have never had this happen before and I am baffled at this issue. Do you have any other suggestions or could it be a Vista upgrade conflict or anything</p>
<p>resulting in an update download?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>Have you installed any other devices recently or right before your scanner quit working?<br />
If you go to the path of the scanner and click on the .exe can you open the scanner?<br />
Do youy have any error messages in the application event viewer referencing the printer scanner at the time it doesn't open?<br />
Have you looked to see if the icon path for the scanner is correct and points to the scanner?<br />
Right click on the scanner icon and look at the properties.</p>
<p>I suggest deleting and recreating the icon shortcut and see if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I'm sorry this isn't answered.&nbsp; Unfortunately the only way to close a thread is to mark a post as an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely, the website you're seeing that "update flash" message on just can't properly detect the flash player.&nbsp; You can probably work around it by adding it to your compatibility view list, which makes the site load as if you were using an older version
 of the OS/Browser.&nbsp; Press Alt-T to show the Tools menu, then choose Compatibility View.</p>
