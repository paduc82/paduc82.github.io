                    <p>Does MultiPoint Manager works in windows 10? or only work in Windows server.</p>
<p>If not work in windows 10 then why you add in features "MultiPoint Connector".</p>
<p>It works just fine in Windows Server 2016 but not working in windows 10.</p>

    <title>Surface Dock USB Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oyevie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock USB Issues</h2>
                    <p>PROBLEM: USB Ports on the dock intermittently quit working. Disconnecting dock, powering off and back on dock, disconnecting USB and reconnecting do not work. Backup drive is generally not detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface has all updates applied. The dock has updated firmware. I've looked through the various threads and don't see anything quite like this described. I've uninstalled the drivers and rebooted. I recently reset the system back to factory and rebuilt
 from there. Problems persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a MS Sculpt Comfort KG &amp; Mouse. After several hours of use, they will quite working. As per above, nothing short of powering off the entire system and dock will restore function. Some external drives cannot be detected. Others will be
 detected, but can't be used as backups because the history software can't find them. Virtually all USB devices will have some kind of problem when plugged into the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these same devices are plugged directly into the surface, they work fine. No reboot is needed. No power cycling of the device is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem running two monitors / Ethernet / audio on the dock. Only the USB is bad. It's been this way since the surface/dock were new over a year ago. I've finally blown my cool. I'm ready to play Frisbee with the Surface 4 Pro. I'm thinking about
 purchasing a USB bridge/hub, but don't know if this will fix the problem or not.... It could be a Surface problem and not the dock at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: all devices work great plugged into the USB port on the surface. No devices work reliably when plugged into the dock.</p>
<p>

            Hey there, <br /><br />Chances are this is malware which has gotten into your computer. Milkilove is a screen recording program. <br /><br />Have you installed any programs/software online, from sites like CNet?<br /><br />Have you got Antivirus installed, if so which one?<br /><br />Methods:<br />Go to Cortana, search Control Panel then go to Programs &gt; Add or remove programs &gt; Search for Milkilove screen recorder. <br /><br />Regards,

Thank you so much for your response. I was hesitant to add programs to my computer as they might be more technical than I am comfortable with. I tried other things like deleting cookies which didn't help. Then I noticed when I used Firefox instead of Google
 the milkilove page never came up. This eventually led me to uninstall Google and reinstall it. That seems to have solved the problem.

<h2>            Call of Duty Advanced Warfare NAT Strict on Motorola Surfboard SBG6782-AC Resolved</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't a request for help but I helped my brother resolve a NAT issue last night and I thought I'd share what worked so maybe others can benefit. Initially the NAT issue was only for the Call of Duty Game, not the Xbox One.
</p>

<p><strong>Modem:</strong> Motorola Surfboard SBG6782-AC</p>
<p>http://www.arrisi.com/products/home/sbg6782-ac.asp</p>
<p>* This was a store bought Wireless Gateway modem that was an upgrade from Comcast Cable's standard issue modem for the speed they signed up for. It was purchased at Bestbuy in FL.</p>

<p><strong>ISP:</strong> Comcat Cable</p>
<p><strong>Connection:</strong> Wired</p>

<p><strong>The issue:</strong> NAT Moderate/Strict (after trying to manually set static IP address on both console and modem configuration interface) and NAT Open on Xbox One, NAT Strict on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What we tried:</strong> After I logged into the modems configuration interface we followed the recommended enable/disable/reboot UPnP, then Port Triggering/Forwarding, and DMZ. I was able to set a static IP on the console but the modem configuration
 static IP we set resulted in many connectivity errors despite using the correct DNS settings on both machines. For his modem it didn't seem to work. After we restored the modem to factory settings I didn't bother to redo the static IP on either machine and
 things worked out. </p>
<p><strong>What worked:</strong> After trying all three with no success, I reset the modem back to factory default settings, disabled the UPnP feature since it wasn't working anyway, and set the DMZ host to match the Xbox IP Address on the network and console.
 I saved the settings, rebooted both the modem and the Xbox One and everything worked out great. I verified everything both on the console and the COD game to make sure there were no more issues.
</p>

<p>I've read around and it seems others are having similar issues but I think if you bought a upgrade modem for your Comcast cable service this solution may work. I know that DMZ is a last resort but for this set-up it worked out. I recommend if you have a
 similar Motorola Surfboard modem trying the three steps above and it that fails just use DMZ.
</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>-Jessica</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Live and Hotmail Passwords - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ripper11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live and Hotmail Passwords</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with both Live and Hotmail accounts.&nbsp; I login to either account, and when I do this login, both Live and Hotmail recognize the username (email address) and associated password.&nbsp; If I try to make a change, it prompts me to LOGIN (I just
 did that), but then when I type in my password, it tells me that the password is not correct or that it doesn't recognize the password.&nbsp; I know I am typing it correctly, as I JUST did it to login originally...but on the verification, it is not.&nbsp; NOT a problem,
 I say I forgot the password, enter&nbsp;the password, and both LIVE and HOTMAIL report that it is the same password already in use.&nbsp; Change the password to something different.&nbsp; Completely log out of LIVE or HOTMAIL, and restart the process; login and go to change
 a setting...prompted to input the password and then I am back to square ONE, password is incorrect or not recognized.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10, but same issue when I log in with my laptop using Windows 7 Ultimate; and two different versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the password is good enough to get me in, but then it is WRONG when I need to enter it a second time to change account information.&nbsp; That makes ZERO sense to me, but then nowadays, not a lot being done within MS makes sense.</p>

</p><p>However we would like to use Skype as we did in the past, without having to create add. e-mailadresses. (and we don't want to move to Skype for Business).<br />
<br />
Can we somehow have our domain being 'unblocked', so we can create Microsoft accounts again ?<br />
Or is it possible in some way to logon to normal Skype (not Skype for Business) with a Work account ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>J.P. de Bakker</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately, work and school email address cannot be used to create a Skype account. You can use a personal email, like Gmail or get a new Outlook
 email. Also, creating an account with a Skype name or username is no longer available, you only have the option to use an email address or phone number when creating a Skype account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            GTA V stuck on &#38;quot&#59;Loading Story Mode&#58; &#38;lt&#59;username&#38;gt&#59;&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I searched for this online and found the same issue occurred on the Xbox 360 and ended up being a big issue requiring a USB install of the game? &nbsp;Rockstar would have to pay me to do that.</p>
<p>It took about an hour for the content to install. &nbsp;After it got to 100%, it stayed on the "Loading Story Mode: &lt;username&gt;" status for about 15 minutes. &nbsp;After a while I gave up, restarted my Xbox, and the game always has the same install loading screen with
 that. &nbsp;So, I uninstalled the game and re installed. &nbsp;It's now another hour later and it's stuck on that same message yet again.</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing this? &nbsp;Is there a fix?</p>

<p>I left the game running at turned off the xbox. </p>
<p>Usually when I turn it on again, is old just continue where I left off.</p>
<p>That wasn't the case this time though. After launching the game, the game was stuck at the high view of the map, the same one that's between switching characters. I could still hear the character and when I moved it the moa would move. But I would see a
 bird eye view of the city only. </p>
<p>I quit the game and now it's stuck at loading story mode. WTF!!!</p>

<p>I am having a similar issue to Averscer's,</p>
<p>I installed the game, download speed was fine, finally opened it and it was stuck at the "Loading Story Mode for ______" screen with the girl in the red bikini. The circle continued to spin, and the tips on the side of the screen continued to update. I quit
 the game and restarted the xbox, and encountered the same issue. After uninstalling and reinstalling the game, I am again getting stuck at the same screen. What else should I do to get this to work?</p>

<p>Im sorry as glad to hear other people are having this problem mine. I can play story if I install the disc offline and stay offline but if I install the patch it freezes then restarts my Xbox I was on line with a support agent for over 3 houirs and no solutions..
 I also tried a digital copy as well as a 2nd hard copy its brutal with all my friends on with no issues what so ever at one point my console said it had data different from the cloud and the data was from May 23 2013 way before the one was released

<p>Having the same issue, however I did get to play the game for a few hours before this issue hit me. It sucks that its happening but I am in a way glad to see I'm not alone with this issue I've exchanged the disc 3 times re-installed 6 times even went as
 far as wiping my one and starting fresh.........3 tickets submitted to Rockstar and it seems they dont care they already got paid so no biggie i guess

                    My Windows 7 taskbar disappears. A VB script from kellyskorner was a fix I found binging and also disabling explorer.exe from the task manager and restarting it are only temporary fixes. Where is the patch to fix this?

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most recent Microsoft operating system supported by Kodak for that device is WinXP.&nbsp; There are no Windows 7 drivers available for it, so you'll most likely not be able to obtain full functionality with Windows 7.&nbsp; If you have Windows &amp; Professional
 or Ultimate, and if your laptop can support virtualization, you might be able to get the printer working under WinXP Mode.</p>

    <title>Connection to Xbox Live very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smusheezy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection to Xbox Live very slow</h2>
                    
<p>Hi i recently got a new Linksys E3000 router and ever since I've started playing Xbox Live on it it has been very slow and sometimes doesn't work. Whenever I turn on my Xbox and it signs me in, it doesn't say I'm connected to live, so I dashboard and click
 the 'Connect to Xbox Live' button and it says it can't connect but whenever I go to the network settings and run a test it says I'm connected and then lets me finally connect when I press the 'Connect to Xbox Live' button. I recently opened the ports to open
 up NAT on my router and was wondering maybe if that was the problem? I have no idea why it is so laggy so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            Hi Kinley-Nidup, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>Question about changing language&#47;localization setting with apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lexskodarap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about changing language&#47;localization setting with apps that are being installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home 64bit edition and the system language is set to english (US), and country/region setting is set to United States. I do however use Croatian (HR) keyboard layout setting as preferred one. I do have several other keyboard layouts
 installed due to both professional and personal requirements, but for some reason windows picked the croatian for the rest of "educated guesses".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my question is - is there a way to prevent windows from installing localized (croatian) versions of apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First app I noticed this issue with was Solitaire Collection that came pre-installed and was updated to localized version somewhere along the way and the latest was Mail app that was installed with most recent windows update.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Have you tried removing the Local Language from the Region and Language settings in Control Panel?<br />
<br />
Also since you've mentioned that you're using a Croatian keyboard layout, check if this workaround sorts out the issue. Here's what to do:
<br />
<br />
1. Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Click on <strong>Clock, Language and Region</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>Language</strong>.<br />
4. Make sure <strong>English</strong> is on top of the list. Move the rest below by using the
<strong>Move down</strong> button. <em>The store uses the language that is at the top of the list.</em><br />
<br />
Let us know if you have questions.<br />
<br />
Regards.

</p><p>I apologize for the late response as we were trying to research a solution for your concern and we’d like to gather additional information about this case:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you declined an event, are you doing this in Google Calendar and not in the Calendar App?</li><li>Do you mind attaching a screenshot of the step by step guide on how you are declining an event in google calendar and how you are seeing this is your Calendar app? You may refer to this

<p>Hi! I have the same problem. I declined the event on&nbsp;my Google calendar, but it still shows up on my Windows calendar (although it shows I declined the event, as you can see in the pictures below).</p>
<p>Note: the picture from Google calendar is just to illustrate which button I pressed.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Access account in express-scripts.com</h2>
                    Unable to access express-scripts.com accounts. This has been a sporadic situation. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does-not. Express Scripts claims the website is fully functional, but I have my doubts. Anyone else have this problem?
