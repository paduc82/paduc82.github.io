<h2>            windows 10 installation stuck at 24&#37; every time</h2>
                    <p>I was very annoyed to see the first time that the windows 10 installation got stuck at 24% total, 83% for the first step and then it happens again exactly the same. i've been searching the web all over for how to fix this but i cant find the solution.</p>
<p>when i look in the windows updater i can see the failed installation's details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>error code: C1900101</p>

<h2>            Unable to link the Microsoft account in Windows 10</h2>
                    My Windows 10 PC was prompting to verify the identity. I clicked on the verify button then a dialog box appeared after a second or two stating that 'You cannot sign in, the device name is already in use' . In Your accounts under setting I clicked on make
 a local account. after that I wanted to sign in&nbsp;and revert back to the&nbsp;Microsoft account. but clicking on it results in nothing. I also tried clicking on add work account but that too doesn't work. I have no idea why this is happening and I am unable to add
 and sync my settings among my devices. Please help. thank you

            <p><span>Hi Sachin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How did you upgrade to Windows 10?</span></li><li><span>From which operating system did you upgrade?</span></li><li><span>When you click on ‚Äú<strong>Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead</strong>‚Äù you will be prompted to enter the email address and password. Are you not seeing this window?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Follow these steps to run the command and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type ‚Äò<strong>sfc /scannow‚Äô</strong> without quotes and hit Enter.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let‚Äôs run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool and check if it fixes the issue. This tool will try to fix the corrupt operating system files.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, Right click on
<strong>Start </strong>and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></li><li><span>Type the following commands. Press Enter after each command.<br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong><br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span></li><li><span>Close the command prompt then check if it fixes the issue. Try this step and let us know the results. We‚Äôd be happy to help if you need any further assistance.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hey Rohit, I tried both the methods you mentioned. And they both were successfully completed. What I am facing right now is that, I had my MS account linked to the PC now after the restore process. But it states that it need to verify my identity, when
 I click on verify, a window appears for a second n disappears and then I am welcomed wid a window stating that 'the local device name is already in use' or sometimes it states 'catastrophic error' .. I am not able to sign in in my Xbox app too.. It shows error
 0x3fb , n says try again later. Hope you reply me soon. Thankyou :)

            <p>I'm having the exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded through the official way, went from 8.1 to 10. Can't verify my account, even though my account is verified. Keep getting the same two error codes as above. Spent hours with MS support trying to solve this but no fix. Cortarna &amp; the Xbox app don't
 work because of this issue, so no point in having W10 really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix would be great, &amp; it would stop me reverting back to 8.1 again.</p>

<p>The game was recently patched to version 1.028</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the update. I had run into a saving issue, but I was able to work around the bug. I know that some were losing their save data all together. However, luckily I was not one of the victims to experience that issue. The issue I had been experiencing,
 was that I wasn't able to save my game when some specific narratives were in place. I was luckily able to get past the issue by doing a bunch of short saves immediately after I launched into my saved game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the patch. The only issue I've noticed. Would be an occasional stutter and frames dropping.</p>

            Yeah, I'm sure the save corruptions were fixed in one of the patches. Just frames and stuttering here also.

            <p>You can downgrade to Windows 2000 but you have to do a clean install that will format your hard drive.&nbsp;I would also verify you have drivers available that work with Windows 2000 before trying the downgrade.
<br />
<br />
Once you have all the proper drivers you set the laptop boot sequence to boot from the CD first.<br />
<br />
Then you put the Win 2K installation CD into the CD drive and boot the computer and follow the installation prompts.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Did you change the Boot Order to Boot from the Windows&nbsp;2000 Disk to then install it?</p>
<p>That will wipe out all your Data as well as XP during installation.</p>

            <p>Why would you use BCDEdit to delete the Windows.old folder? BCD allows you edit the Boot Manager.

<p>If there is a boot entry you would like to edit or remove, use EasyBCD:</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the&nbsp;Windows boot manager.

<p>As suggested by Shad0wmanUK, I would recommend testing the Xbox's hardware by first attempting to run a wired connection directly to your router or gateway. If the connection comes back ok or if you are unable to test the connection this way, might I recommend
 reseting the console's network settings back to factory default as the previous owners may have used custom settings. This can be done by going into the network settings, selecting "Configure Network", go over to the "Additonal Settings" tab, and selecting
 the "Restore to Factory Defaults" option.</p>
<p>If you are not able to reset the settings, please reply back with the exact error message you recieve.</p>

<h2>            Don&#39;t share files between user accounts</h2>
                    I like to have a guest account without access to all my docs. In Windows XP somehow I had this set up so the Guest account could not view any of my files. That's what Guest means. How do I set this up in Windows 7? I created a Guest account but they can
 see files I created on the user/owner account.

            Actually, that is not "what the Guest account means" and Guest should not be used.<br />
<br />
Do not use the Guest account you see in the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. The Guest account is a special system account, not one meant for when you are feeling hospitable. It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Linux, Unix, and
 OS X for a reason.<br />
<br />
From TechNet:<br />
<br />
"The Guest account is intended for users who require temporary access to the system. However, if this account is enabled, a security risk may exist because an unauthorized user could gain anonymous access to the system through this account."<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
So if you enabled Guest, disable it now and create a Standard/Limited (Vista, Windows 7,&nbsp; XP Pro/XP Home) for your visitors. Call the new user account something like "Visitor". The Visitor account will not have access to your own user account's documents, etc.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

<h2>            Unsaved Progress - Xbox Game Pass</h2>
                    <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some good progress while playing RECORE: DEFINITIVE EDITION, via the Xbox Game Pass, yesterday. &nbsp;However when I opened the game to continue where I left off today, my progress wasn't saved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to resurrect the progress I made, or is it lost forever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi J,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Are you an Xbox Live Gold member? If so then your saves may be on the cloud uploaded automatically, to troubleshoot this try this step out.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Enter<strong> Settings</strong></li><li>Choose<strong> System</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Storage</strong></li><li>Choose<strong> Clear Local Save Games</strong></li><li>Allow the console to restart</li><li>Launch the game</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The game should sync all saved games, if the saves are not available to you after, then they may be permanently missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again.</p>

<h3> jeffhuggins59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble trying to complete a Skype video call&#58; Getting disconnected automatically</h2>
                    Recently, every time I try to Skype with my main Skype-partner, as soon as one of us answers a Skype video call from the other, we get a blank screen and the call is automatically ended.&nbsp; This happens in both directions, when I try to call her and when
 she tries to call me.&nbsp; Also, it seems that one or the other of us is automatically off-lined fairly frequently.&nbsp; Is this a common problem?&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong?&nbsp; How can I fix things?&nbsp; Thank you for any help you can provide.

    <title>No access to shared files after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No access to shared files after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I have one pc running windows 10 and two other machines running windows XP and they are all on the same network. Until a recent update everything fine but now there appears to be no way the the XP machines can access files on the windows 10 machine. I have
 tried virtually every solution offered on various forums but, nothing is successful. Any suggestions please will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa and thanks for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not at the machine question at the moment but I can give you some details before I return to the office tomorrow. A point that I didn't mention in my original question was that a Microsoft technician was logged into our machine and helping to fix &nbsp;Windows
 because the update had caused problems with our printer. She decided to create a new user which fixed the printer problem and a few other issues but, at the same time we lost all of our Outlook data as well as the ability to share files. Fortunately some data
 was backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Windows 10 machine can access files on both XP machines but they cannot access the Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. We are connected to a homegroup (have done for many years)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The error message is something like "You do not have permission to access this device please consult your administrator" or something similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I will have to check tomorrow but I think it was 4-5 updates ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all of those settings that you have recommended on numerous occasions and they are all correct. This is why I have decided to throw the question to the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that I constructed my question in such a fashion that it would succinct and therefore easy to understand. I do not need to enable file sharing on the WP machines because I can already access those files from the W10 machine. My question is why
 can't I access the W10 files from the XP machines? The instructions on how to enable file sharing in Windows 10 is of no use whatsoever because as I mentioned originally all settings are correct and were working prior to the update.</p>

<h2>            Brand new game &#40;Rocksmith 2014&#41; Unreadable </h2>
                    
<p>Hi i've bought a brand new copy of Rocksmith 2014 for the 360 and the disc is unreadable straight out of the box. All other games seem to work. I've tried a disk clean but that hasn't fixed it. Should I contact the retailer who sold me the game? Cheers</p>

                    <p>I have an issue with skype desktop application for some time now.</p>
<p>I don't see some of the messages that others are sending me (NB: not all messages, just some of them randomly). Others have sent me screenshots of our conversation and to them everything seems ok and the missing messages, that I don't see, are there. When
 I use skype web application then everything is ok and I can see all messages&nbsp; including messages not showing in desktop application.</p>
<p>I have tried to unistall and reinstall skype - nothing changes.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one March 2017 update keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>As said in the title, every time the update gets to 63-64% it restarts over and over and it never gets higher, I don't know what to do, is there something wrong with the Xbox and have other people experienced this?</p>

<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>I totally agree with you that all cannot have the hardware problems. Let me inform you that the hardware specific drivers are not developed by Microsoft. The Windows Operating System only has the generic drivers by which many of the hardware
 work properly. But, some of the hardware functionalities may not be available if you are using the generic drivers that comes with the operating system.</font></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>So, the exact specific drivers need to be downloaded and installed from the hardware manufacturer's website. You may download the Windows 8.1 compatible drivers from the Dell/Graphics Card manufacturer‚Äôs website and check if that resolves the
 issue. It would be great if you can provide the graphics card model number on the computer.</font></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>You may search for the latest Windows 8.1 compatible drivers for the graphics card model from this link:</font></font></p>

<p><font><font>If the issue still persists, then it would be better to get in touch with the graphics card manufacturer support for further assistance. You may contact the NVIDIA Support from this link:</font></font></p>

            Rajesh,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am aware that the Nvidia drivers are made by Nvidia.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt;&nbsp;It would be great if you can provide the graphics card model number on the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok. Here's some details:</div>
<div>Machine: Dell Presicion M4400, Intel Core Duo T9600 2.8GHz</div>
<div>OS: Windows 8.1 64bit</div>
<div>Graphics: Nvidia Quadro FX 770M</div>
<div><br />
<div>My machine started to bluescreen (or should that be turquoise-screen ;) after I upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1. Removing the graphics driver, as you suggested, worked. No problems running the standard driver. Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did try to reinstall the latest nvidia driver but that failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ended up installing an older, Windows 7 version (275.33-notebook-win7-winvista-64bit-international-whql), as suggested by Arsalan (Thanks, btw) and that seems to work.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for replying with the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate your patience and the efforts that you have taken on this issue. We are glad to know that it is working with the old Windows 7 compatible WHQL drivers. In future, if you still find any issue with this driver, you may
 try reinstalling it in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if that helps. To install any drivers/apps in its compatibility mode, you may refer to this article:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 https &#43; client certificate</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 enterprise, and I have got some odd behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I attempt to access a site that uses https and client certificate authentication I get a 403 forbidden error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens for multiple different sites with multiple different certificates
<a href="https://gklaw.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&amp; <a href="https://capablegroupinc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My certificates are all fully trusted and in my local user store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The certificates work on other non windows 5 machines, and we have been able to see on one machine that the https handshake is successful its failing at the client.</p>

<br />If you have Windows 10 1709 installed with cumulative update .309 installed, I recommend you uninstall it.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />If the following KBs are are installed, right click KB4089848 then click uninstall

<h2>            Microsoft&#8217;s Show or Hide Updates tool</h2>
                    <p>Basically Windows 10 1809 does not work well with my systems at all.&nbsp; I have one Lenovo and one HP laptop that when the update installed the speed of the computers slowed down by maybe 25 to 35 percent.&nbsp; On each laptop if I unplug from a power source the
 screen just gets dark.&nbsp; No way to make the screen bright.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to Windows 1803 and everything now is back to normal.&nbsp; When I go on battery power I can increase the screen brightness and the machines are working a lot faster.&nbsp; I found the Microsoft‚Äôs Show or Hide Updates tool at the website below.&nbsp; The tool
 is near the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if I use this tool can I just tell it not to install the 1809 update for awhile?&nbsp; Basically I think Microsoft will fix the issues but I just need to use my laptops without a power source at times.&nbsp; Has anyone used this tool to delay a Windows
 10 update or will this not work?&nbsp; Plus i'm wondering if I do delay the update for awhile will I still get security updates.</p>

            Hi Tony,
<br />
<br />You can use that tool, indeed, 1809 is a feature update and it can be deferred. However, you can go into Update &amp; Security in Windows Settings, into the Windows Update tab, then go into Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Under "A feature update includes new capabilities and improvements. It can be deferred for this many days.", put how many days you'd like to defer it.
<br />
<br />During this time, each feature update (1803 specifically) will get their own share of cumulative updates that include quality and security fixes.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />Ethan's instructions are very correct but are only applicable if you are using Windows 10 Pro. If you are using Windows 10 Home, yes you can use the show hide tool. Also, as 1809 is currently in seeker only mode you would not get that automatically and I think the condition would be the same for the next month or so.

            An extension on what I've just said -- Sumit is correct, to defer a feature update by an x amount of days, you must be on Windows 10 Pro, so the WU show/hide tool is sufficient for Home, if you have that.

 latest drivers for it as well as a beta driver but with no luck. Is there a way to disable the Microsoft one?

            Hello, I had the same problem with Microsoft Basic Render Driver being displayed. After much googling I discovered that this was caused by Windows Update KB2795944. Upon uninstalling this update my graphics card driver is now correctly labelled in System
 Info etc.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The effect seems to be purely cosmetic. I don't believe the incorrect driver being displayed had any impact on graphics performance.</div>
