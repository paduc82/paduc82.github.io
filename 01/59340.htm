    <title>Why I have folder called Documents under my user in the Explorer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alonsogutierrez chavez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why I have  folder called Documents under my user in the Explorer&#63; One is from OneDrive and it&#39;s confusing&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I understand that Microsoft wants to do anything possible to force users use and be depending on Microsoft's applications. However, forcing the OneDrive folders in the explorer to the point that it changes the normal folder structure and continuously shows
 2 folders called documents is absurd. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder structure of the user should be: User &gt; Documents, Music, Downloads, OneDrive (with its folders INSIDE), etc...</p>
<p>Instead Windows 10 has: User &gt; Documents, Documents, Music, Downloads. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is making it extremely confusing and annoying for users. Is there any way to remediate this? I have tried deleting the folder and it creates itself again, and I have tried to change the path but I am not allowed (and I have admin rights).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a dual partition running Ubuntu and waiting for Unity 8. I sincerely hope there is an easy setting to disable showing the EXTRA DOCUMENTS folder in the explorer, instead of me having to completely uninstall OneDrive and messing with the registry,
 which is just one step closer to getting me to stop using Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            <p>I find it amusing when people say they want things the way MS used to do it, not the way they now do it. You were happy to accept MS teaching you how to use your PC 10 years ago, but not now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like the people that complained bitterly in the early 1990's when MS "forced" them to use a mouse and Windows. Many at the time said they would never use a mouse and they would never use Windows. A couple of years later, guess what, they're using Windows
 and loving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years pass and Windows 95 comes out with a Start button instead of Program Manager. Same people now complain that it's stupid to click start to shutdown their PC. Despite the fact that it's the same as a car, you use the same device to start it and
 to stop it. A year or two passes and everyone is suddenly happy with the Start button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More years pass and Window 8 comes along. Everyone complains again about the Start Screen.............</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we have Windows 10 and people are complaining about the start menu reappearing........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty dumb isn't it! How long do we have to wait for people to learn this lesson?</p>

<p>Your response is very amusing. Not only because it's not a helpful reply, but because it mocks two unrelated things, which shows your lack of reading comprehension skills or just ignorance. Adding extra features (new technologies, mouse, start button) compared
 to not allowing the user to have full control of their directory. I love oneDrive, and its integration should be awesome, but having 2 duplicate DOCUMENT folders under the main User and being incapable of removing one of them does not seem helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyway, bravo to you! your condescension should make you feel superior today.</p>

<p>I understand that sometimes people are feeling down, so by expressing how dumb other people are and how smart you are it can make you feel better and improve your self-esteem. However, may I ask you you do that in another post or website.? Here, I am trying

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt response! I just got time to try your solution, however after making the changes in msconfig and rebooting I continue to have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should explain myself, I got this computer 3 weeks ago, and I believe this happened recently after the latest update from Windows 10 (it was about a couple of days ago), or maybe I just noticed now (I haven't been using Windows much).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is visible in the File Explorer, on the left side bar, under DESKTOP, there are some folders one called OneDrive, which has my data sync and its fine, and the other is MY_USERNAME, which when expanded it shows Contacts, Desktop, etc. In here there
 appear 2 instances of the folder DOCUMENTS. but one is the one located under my username, and the other is a shortcut to OneDrive/Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This becomes an issue because they both look exactly the same, but have completely different behaviors (one saves your files in your computer, and the other makes them available through OneDrive from any device). I think the concept is great, but the current
 implementation is extremely confusing. Especially when I am downloading something and want to save it in my Documents, but I can never be sure where I am saving it to. And I cannot rename it or get rid of the shortcut. (Plus, if I were to make a shortcut I
 would prefer it in any other place than a folder that already contains DOCUMENTS, right?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alonso</p>

    <title>Why is itunes downloading files from my One Drive folders, what is it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> princealberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is itunes downloading files from my One Drive folders, what is it doing with them, and how can I stop it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently slicked my hard drive and reinstalled Windows 10 home.&nbsp; Today I installed iTunes.&nbsp; The first time I opened it, right after I logged in to my iTunes account, I got a windows notification that "iTunes is downloading files from One Drive".&nbsp; This
 raises some concerns.<br />
<br />
1. I didn't tell it to do anything.</p>
<p>2. I wasn't doing anything at all that required one drive access.</p>
<p>3. There is nothing in the iTunes settings or software that I can see that would require or allow this access.</p>
<p>4. It wasn't even accessing music or videos, it was downloading my photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen where someone else asked this question, but the Microsoft response was not useful.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me, how can I stop this from happening again?</p>

            Hi, PrinceAlberts,
<br />
<br />If you're saving Files to iCloud, the files may be syncing with your device.
<br />
<br />I see folders on OneDrive in my Documents and Pictures folder on my Computer. 
<br />Same Named Container File
<br />
<br />Check your Network Share settings.
<br />This can be configured in Control Panel on PC

<p>Thank you for the reply, but I don't use iCloud.&nbsp; I didn't install the desktop app and iTunes doesn't sync to iCloud.&nbsp; I did look at my network and sharing settings, but they are more geared toward sharing files between users and other computers, but I didn't
 see anything that would affect programs accessing these files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a bit complicated...&nbsp; Normally, in a domain environment, you'd be able to sync your setting to a domain controller.&nbsp; That way, the settings would always stay within the domain... and never leave the premises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the current version of Windows Server doesn't yet support syncing with Edge.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;some folks have been using Azure Active Directory instead (since it does support "Enterprise State Roaming").</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for a lot of folks, moving from an on-premises domain to an Azure domain, is just not practical (or cost effective).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: No, linking your domain account to your Microsoft Account doesn't solve the problem completely.&nbsp; Since this would require that every employee also have a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Also many secure environments will not allow connections to off-premises data
 storage services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a free 3rd-party application that can help solve this problem without having to migrate your domain to Azure AD.&nbsp;&nbsp; This solution is not as feature rich as "Enterprise State Roaming", but it does work.</p>

<h2>            The Speakers, headset or headphone is unplugged Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I've been searching around the whole internet to find a good tutorial that can fixed this problem but nothing seem to works.. So I hope you guys don't give me the same method, cause it's not gonna work I've tried bunch of times and it won't work.<br />
The methods I tried:<br />
- Going to services and find windows audio and restart it (tried that didn't work)<br />
- restart my pc (wow, not gonna restart again and again)</p>
<p>I can't remember what other methods didn't worked for me but hopefully you guys could help me. If this can't solve my audio problem I'm gonna cry. ;-; If u guys need screenshot please tell me. I'm really stressed that I wasted my whole time on fixing this
 problem so don't stressed me out with arguments or whatever ****....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated my Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8.1.. and I went to Hardware &amp; Sound click on Sound the speaker there say is unplugged (What?! But is already plugged in...) and I tried wearing my headset and nothing pop-ups on the Sound "Playback".. Also,
 taskbar that volume thinggy has a red cross "x" on it and there's no "!" mark on "Sound, video and game controllers"..</p>

It says "Hardware changes might not have been detected" &nbsp;Detected and the yellow exclamation mark.<br />
<br />
Method 2 will not work for me cause it says my Speaker is not plugged in but it's already plugged in. Tried using headphone but nothing came out saying that I'm using my headphone in Playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, I check the Recording, Line In is in Default Device with a green tick and Stereo Mix is Ready, but my Microphone is not plugged in..<br />

Please help me solve this quick &gt;-&lt;</p>

<h3> bspaz615  say:</h3>
<h2>            License Transfer</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox broke so decided to buy a used one off of amazon. I just received it and went through all the initial steps for setting it up. I used a license transfer so that i would be able to make purchases for my account. Unfortunately I will be sending the
 product back to the seller because it freezes and has trouble updating. I was just wondering if there was any way to get another license transfer for the new Xbox I will be buying. I don't really want to wait the month or three months for the new license transfer.</p>

<p>I have original Xbox 360 elite console</p>

You can try to <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support directly</a></strong> to see if they would be able to give you some sort of a manual transfer. If if they are unable to this for you then you
 would need to wait until the 3 month window passes before you're able to license transfer again. There wouldn't be any other way around that, sorry.</p>

 status of the computer, press Windows key +X, select ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô. In the system properties window, check the activation status under ‚ÄòWindows activation‚Äô section.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;If Windows is not activated, I would suggest you to try activating Windows again to resolve this issue. You can also click on the action center icon (Flag icon) at the notification
 tray in the task bar to see if there is any activation error displayed. You can refer to this article for more information on the most common activation error messages and the steps to resolve them:</span><span>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;<br />
If the Windows activation status in the system properties window was displayed as already activated, then the issue could be caused due to some corrupt system files. In this case, I would suggest you to run a System File Check. System File checker (SFC) scan
 is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:

<br />
</span></p>
<span>1. What happens when you try to enter into change PC settings?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and check if you are able to access change PC settings. Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate
 the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a><span><br />
<br />
</span>If you are able to access change PC settings in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot.

<p>Hi Eileen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Defender or another antivirus software will sometimes block a certain app or file from running or being installed</strong>. With this, you can check the
<strong>quarantine section</strong> of the antivirus program you are using to see which program is being blocked. To better assist you, we need the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the<strong> exact error message</strong> did you receive after launching or running the app?</li><li>Which <strong>antivirus program</strong> are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest disabling the Windows Defender SmartScreen and see if the app will run. To do this, simply follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Windows Defender</strong> on the search box and click on the first option.</li><li>On the left side of the window, click on the <strong>Window icon (App &amp; browser control)</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>SmartScreen </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>Windows </strong>
<strong>Store </strong><strong>apps </strong>column, select <strong>Off</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

            Hi Steven
<br />
<br />Windows 10 only contains the Photos App, which has very basic photo editing/processing capability
<br />
<br />There are a few really good free applications you can download to edit photos, the two best totally free applications I would recommend are:
<br />
<br />GIMP (fully featured)
<br /><a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.gimp.org/downloads/</a>
<br />
<br />InfranView (a bit more basic)

                    <p>I have downloaded Windows Live mail and have found it satisfactory so far - but one MAJOR issue is that there is NO help menu and I cannot find any tools/options that allow me to see full message headers as could have been done with Outlook Express.&nbsp; This
 is a MAJOR flaw and I need to be able to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For me seems that Samsung replace "AllShare Play" with "Samsung Link" so they revoke instalation of "allsharepcsw.exe".</p>
<p>

 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other good option is to get <strong>"PC share manager 4.2</strong>", even no upgraded from 19.07.2010</p>
<p>Extra methods for sharing folders from external HDD -&gt; 2 methods :</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> edit C:\Program Files\Samsung\PC Share Manager\configinfo.ini
</p>
<p>- under the Shared Folders section, add a new line with the path of the folder on the external drive;</p>
<p>- save the ini file and close it;</p>
<p>- then open PC Share Manager and the folder on the external drive will be shared already.
</p>
<p>- update the DB by clicking the Set Changed State button</p>
<p><strong>b. </strong>open command prompt (run ... cmd) with administrator privileges</p>
<p>- make an active shortcut for folder from external drive on to one of internal volumes</p>
<p>&nbsp; <strong>mklink /d</strong> <em>c:\link x:\shares&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\link = name of active link ; x:\shares = name of folder to share from external HDD;</em></p>
<p><em>- </em>then open PC Share Manager and <em>just add the link to shared folders;</em></p>
<p><em>- </em>update the DB by clicking the Set Changed State button</p>
<p>It's very usefull for sharing to smart TV or other devices great media. I use it to share about 2.5 TB of movies, played easily with TV's player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or try Samsung Link. You need to install after you connect with samsung account.</p>

                    <p>My current version of Windows 10 is working well on my computer. Are there any key benefits to upgrading right away to Windows 10 October 2018 update version 1809?</p>

<p>It really depends on your needs. But for most users, the immediate benefit is security. Windows 10 is a service and with each release, there are always improvements to the security foundation in a feature update.
</p>
<p>That said, Microsoft continues to support earlier versions of Windows 10, especially if its the most recent versions, such as 1803 or 1709. So, you don‚Äôt need to upgrade right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always recommend first checking to make sure your system is compatible with the latest release:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don‚Äôt want to be an earlier adopter, you can always wait a few months until the new version matures a bit with cumulative updates. Just like taxes and debt, there will always be bugs, glitches and unknown issues in a newer release. So, if you are
 excited to upgrade right away, at least backup your current installation first. This will make it easy to restore it if the new version just does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what exactly is new in this release? Here are some of the new features that might interest you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Over 150 new emoji.</strong> This latest collection includes superheroes, a softball, a pirate flag plus some nice improvements to existing emoji. You can access them using the Emoji Panel (WIN+.) or the touch keyboard.3
</p>
<p><strong>A convenient portal into the physical world. </strong>For those immersed in a virtual Mixed Reality session, we‚Äôve adding the ability to peer out into your physical environment ‚Äî without removing your headset.
</p>
<p><strong>An improved Windows update experience.</strong> Before an update, Windows will automatically check if you are currently using your machine and schedule a better time to reboot.
</p>
<p><strong>Skype for Windows 10 gets a big update. </strong>The new Skype for Windows 10 update includes a customizable group calling experience, easier screen sharing and access to contacts, the option to capture images during video calls, and more.
</p>
<p><strong>Redesigned Microsoft Edge menu and Settings. </strong>Based on your feedback, we've simplified the menu and better organized Settings into sub-pages. We've also added a much-requested option to customize which icons appear in the toolbar. (Go to
 ‚ÄùShow in toolbar‚Äù in the "‚Ä¶" menu.) </p>
<p><strong>Control whether media in Microsoft Edge can play automatically. </strong>
We‚Äôve added a new setting to allow you to control whether sites can autoplay media. You can find this under Settings&gt;Advanced&gt; Media autoplay.</p>
<p><strong>A better way to copy paste. </strong>Simply press WIN+V to access our brand-new clipboard experience. Now you can paste from a clipboard history and pin the items you find yourself using all the time. Access your clipboard across any PC running Windows
 10 1809 or later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dark theme comes to File Explorer. </strong>Along with this top request, we also added dark theme support to the File Explorer context menu, as well as the Common File Dialog (aka the Open and Save dialogs).</p>
<p><strong>Notepad Search with Bing. </strong>To use, simply highlight any words or phrase in Notepad, right click and select ‚Äúsearch with Bing‚Äù.
</p>
<p><strong>Start Tile folder naming. </strong>Simply drag tiles on top of one another to create a folder. When you expand the folder, you‚Äôll see a new option to name it.
</p>
<p><strong>Save time with Search Previews.</strong> We have expanded previews to support apps, documents and more. Get quick answers from Bing, links to recent documents, file info and other preview info.
</p>
<p><strong>Easier screenshot sharing. </strong>Just press the quick action button in Action Center called "Screen Snip" (or press WIN+shift+S), then add a message and share.
</p>
<p><strong>Acrylic in Task View. </strong>We continue to add more Fluent Design to Windows, including a soft blur Acrylic effect to the entire Task View background.
</p>
<p><strong>Roaming Usage. </strong>Does your device have a SIM? We‚Äôve updated Data Usage Settings to let you know how much data you are using while roaming!
</p>
<p><strong>Magnifier improvements. </strong>Based on your feedback, we made two improvements: 1) your mouse can now be centered on the screen in full screen mode for easier tracking, and 2) we added two more zoom level increments (5 and 10%).</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth battery percentage in Settings.</strong> In Bluetooth &amp; other devices Settings, you can now check the battery level of your Bluetooth devices.
</p>
<p><strong>A smarter calculator. </strong>Windows Calculator now correctly calculates square roots for perfect squares (integers that are squares of other integers).</p>
<p><strong>Less interruptions when gaming. </strong>Focus assist will turn on automatically when you‚Äôre playing any full screen game.
</p>
<p><strong>Fluent Design for Windows Defender Security Center.</strong> We‚Äôve heard your feedback and we‚Äôve updated Windows Defender Security Center (WDSC) to include the Fluent Design elements you know and love.
</p>
<p><strong>Cortana Show Me now supports voice queries. </strong>You can now launch the new preview app with your voice for help with Windows settings.7</p>
<p><strong>Create your own font. </strong>With the Microsoft Font Maker app available in Windows Store, you can use your pen to create a font based on your personal handwriting style.
</p>
<p><strong>An easier way to capture and share screen shots. </strong>Try our new Screen Sketch app directly from the Snipping Tool. You can launch the app directly to start (and share) a snip from there. Or, for even faster screenshots, just press WIN+Shift+S
 or create a shortcut and press the back of your pen or the Print Screen key.</p>
<p><strong>Faster access to your top sites. </strong>Just right-click the Microsoft Edge icon in the Task Bar to see a list of your most visited sites.
</p>
<p><strong>Better menus in Microsoft Edge. </strong>We‚Äôve added icons and shortcuts to the ‚ÄúSettings and more‚Äù menu and provided an option to label groups of tabs you‚Äôve set aside. For Downloads, we‚Äôve expanded the menu, so you can right-click to ‚Äúshow in folder‚Äù
 and ‚Äòcopy link‚Äô. </p>
<p><strong>An easier way to launch apps in Sets. </strong>We continue to improve our new Sets feature based on your feedback. When you click the plus button to add apps in a Sets window, you‚Äôll now be able to browse the All Apps list, rather than just using
 the search box.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless projection improvements. </strong>Users told us it‚Äôs hard to know when they‚Äôre wirelessly projecting ‚Äî so we‚Äôve added a new control banner that appears when you‚Äôre in session. This banner also lets you tune the connection for optimal latency
 between screens. </p>
<p><strong>Improved local experience. </strong>To enjoy display language quality improvements, go to Settings App&gt;Time &amp; Language&gt;Language, click on the Add a Windows display language with Local Experience Packs link and download a Local Experience Pack from
 the Microsoft Store. (</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Reality improvements. </strong>You can now run Mixed Reality without a physical monitor (great for backpack PCs). Also, apps running in Windows Mixed Reality can make use of the Capture UI API. Try adding an image to a message in Mail in the
 Cliff House, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Resume activities you started in the past. </strong>With Timeline in Task View, you can quickly scroll back to content you opened earlier ‚Äî like a webpage, document, article, playlist, or task ‚Äî even if you‚Äôve closed an app or file. It even works
 across activities on different PCs.</p>
<p><strong>An easier way to share files. </strong>Wirelessly share files and URLs to nearby PCs via Bluetooth using the new Near Share feature.</p>

<p>Today I found a file that said it had to be scanned with the MRT.</p>
<p>I started it, and it's been running for 5 hours now and is still just around 20% done.</p>
<p>How long does a scan normally take??</p>
<p>And when it's done, what do I have to do? <br />
First time I heard of MRT so I really have no idea.</p>

<h2>            Loss of video on my Dell E207WFP LCD Monitor </h2>
                    Just upgraded from Vista to windows 7 home premium, a little slow, but when I turn off my Monitor, it will not come back on line, no video.&nbsp; Tried pressing many keys&nbsp;no luck.&nbsp; It's a pain to restart to see video.

<span>Hi ArtMax,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which application are you using to watch the video on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen only with a particular video or with other videos as well?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur with online with videos or even downloaded videos as well?</span></p>
<p><span>This might be an issue with the drivers on the computer, you may need to update the Display adapter drivers on the computer,
 and first you have to uninstall the drivers and reinstall the latest drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand the Display adapters in the Device Manager window.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Display adapter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Driver Tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Uninstall Drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Now restart the computer and download the latest drivers for the Display Adapter from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you have any software that is provided along with the LCD monitor, I suggest that you install the drivers from the software and check if the issue is resolved or not.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let me know if&nbsp;this worked.<br />

<p>Hi Diana,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your answer. The laptop is HP elite book. The mouse works perfectly for every other thing except for zooming out and in, when I scroll the mouse wheel. This happens for all applications on this laptop I have also tried it on another laptop
 - Toshiba, and it's the same thing. I took it back to the shop where I purchased it; even there they couldn't get it to work on my laptop. However, they claimed that if I download a special driver for "intelli" mouse from Microsoft website that it will work.
 I returned it and got my money back, simply because I was not prepared to download a special driver from Microsoft website, each time I take the mouse to a different computer.</p>

 I wanted to do it, and Twitter allowed me to do in the settings, but I don't seem to be able to find it on Skype.</p>

</p><p>I have successfully made a USB UEFI bootable Flash drive, and when I boot it up it starts I get past the Langauage and keyboard screen, I then press the install, but it stops and says that a media drivers is missing and then asks me to select and install
 drivers.&nbsp; I have a look on the Bootable Flash Drive for driversbut cannot see any any ideas where the appropiate drivers are or do I have to get them from HP and put them on disk?</p>

<h2>            How do I change the time Windows checks for updates&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I try to use my computer around 10AM, it runs SOOOOOO slow because it's searching for updates.&nbsp; Is there any way I can change the time at which it searches for updates?&nbsp; It's driving me nuts.

<p>I have seen people report this issue that their Xbox One is failing to do an update. The first thing i would do is unplug your xbox one for a few minutes, unplug from the wall completely. &nbsp;Then power up and patiently wait through the long bootup process.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, other people with similar issues referenced that they fixed their console by running this tool:</p>
