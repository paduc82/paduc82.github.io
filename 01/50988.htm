<h2>            Cant use more than 4 monitors</h2>
                    <p><strong>I have a custom built computer running windows 10 upgraded from windows 7 that has a "Sapphire Tri-X R9 290X" graphics card installed. It is a 4GB GDDR5 512bit. It has two DVI ports one Display port and one HDMI port. I have 4 monitors; 2 HP Pavilion
 20xi, 1 Dell IN2030M and 1 Acer P186H. the two Pavilions are connected using the 2 DVI ports the Dell is connected using the display port and the Acer is connected tot he HDMI port using a HDMI to VGA adapter. When I start up my computer the computer boots
 using the Dell and Acer monitors but when it is finished booting the computer only uses the 2 Pavilions and the dell</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>(I did not have 4 monitors when I was using windows 7)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I try to extend my display to the Acer I get an error message "The display settings could not be saved. Please try a different combination of display settings." It also wont let me duplicate the 4th monitor with any of the active monitors.</strong></p>
<p><em>(The 4th monitor can be any one of the monitors as long as it is not a active monitor)</em></p>
<p>

            Thanks for the response but as I stated in my post my drives were just updated to the lastes drives. I recived the drivers from the manufactures website and it was just provided for windows 10. As for the information on how to add a second monitor I already
 know how to add monitors to my computer I have 3 of them working my issues is that the computer wont let me add a 4th for reasons unknown to me

    <title>Xbox one stereo headset low mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eager troll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one stereo headset low mic</h2>
                    
<p>The microphone on the xbox one stereo headset is very low. Several people in a party &nbsp;can not hear me and says it sounds muffled. I did a test using skype echo number and i can confirm that compared to the headset that comes with the console it is extremely
 low on the stereo headset. I've already replaced them once and the behavior is the same with the new pair. Is there any way to fix this or is a update coming out soon to address this? I really want to keep them but not having a working mic is a deal breaker
 and would force me to return it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Conclusion:: Windows Defender is incompatible with Windows 10 and Windows Update and actually dangerous (it corrupts the OS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a really HUGE mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to see if I could disable Windows Defender from messing around with trusted applications. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender has an Exclusions feature.<br />
</p>
<p>I added Exclusions for all of my 32 bit applications.<br />
</p>
<p>skse_loader.exe,&nbsp;TESV.exe,&nbsp;SkyrimLauncher.exe,&nbsp;ModOrganizer.exe, steam.exe, LOOT.exe, BodySlide.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a built in one second file access&nbsp;delay on Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ModOrganizer takes like 5 minutes &nbsp;to open whereas it used to load in 10 seconds or less. MO reads like a thousand files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to add the run as administrator bit, because suddenly it couldn't write files anymore? &nbsp;I did not install the games or their files into program files because I wanted to avoid this issue, but setting exclusions did something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When MO spawns a new applications it even more horrible. &nbsp;LOOT takes about 30 seconds to come up, whereas it used to be immediate, but you can actually read the files LOOT is scanning, whereas it used to do that fast and it wasn't readily apparent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;skse_loader.exe now takes about 5 minutes to even come up and Skyrim another 3 minutes just to load a save game. &nbsp;Skyrim is running perfectly, its just the file access that sucks. &nbsp;It take about 3 minutes to change cells (go from inside to outside).
 It all does eventually run, but file IO is seriously delayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the exclusions from Windows Defender, but it still seemed to be doing whatever it is doing. &nbsp;I think adding exclusion changed something somewhere and removing file exclusions did not change it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling Windows Defender, but it has changed something in the the way Windows 10 handles file IO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender actually broke Windows 10 Pro? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Defender appears to be incompatible with Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is, 64 bit applications seem unaffected, although I do not use them, and Windows 10 still boots in under 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Avast since Windows Defender appears to be extremely dangerous, but Avast file access is seriously delayed to. &nbsp; Avast works, but it all very slow with a built in file access delay.<br />
</p>
<p>I was just wondering if anyone knows what happens to Windows 10 when Windows Defender has a exclusion set and how to undo it from Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Options?</p>
<p>1. Reinstall Windows 10 over Windows 10?</p>
<p>2. Uninstall Windows Defender?</p>
<p>3. Uninstall UAC&nbsp;and reinstall it? (a forced reset)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Uninstall UAC forever?</p>
<p>5. Disable file indexing?</p>
<p>6. Wipe the hard drive completely and reinstall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, reinstalling windows might actually work.</p>
<p>I think it resets everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Sorry it took so long to get back, but after I disabled disk caching and indexing the problem appeared to kind of be fixed but would come and go away again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am virus and mal-ware free, new installation, but I double checked anyway with Malware bytes and Avast because even Microsoft gets infected now and then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the problem with file I/O seems to be associated with how much data was changed on my disk drive, like when installing new game mods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I left Skyrim unmodifed, &nbsp;things would slowly get better, but as soon as I modified data again, the access delay problem would hit me hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually disabled a lot of background applications in desperation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AiChargerPlus.exe - AsusTek Computer Inc.&nbsp;(I don't need it)</p>
<p>CLMLSvc_P2G8.exe -&nbsp;CyberLink MediaLibrary Service&nbsp;(I don't need it)</p>
<p>VirtualDrive.exe -&nbsp;CyberLink Virtual Drive&nbsp;&nbsp;(I don't need it)</p>
<p>jusched.exe -&nbsp;Java Update Scheduler (no excuse for an updater always running?)</p>
<p>OSA.EXE -&nbsp;Microsoft Office XP component&nbsp;(I don't need it, no Office, only Word)</p>
<p>OneDrive.exe -&nbsp;Microsoft OneDrive&nbsp;(I don't need it)</p>
<p>rundll32.exe - NVidia Capture Service Proxy (game video capture)</p>
<p>Program - Unknown, appears to a null entry hidden somewhere in the registry.<br />
</p>
<p>I think Program is a leftover from a Comodo Firewall uninstall. Avast and Comodo are hard to set up compatibility wise, although it can be done, so I am using Windows Firewall which actually received some favorable reviews.<br />
</p>
<p>OSA.EXE is included in Microsoft Word 2002 and I&nbsp;suspect that it is responsible for my file access delay problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft never fully disclosed what it is or what it does, but I suspect its a&nbsp;Windows XP indexing service.<br />
</p>
<p>I wish I knew how to uninstall it and leave Word 2002 behind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing it is caused by OSA.exe? T.B.D.</p>

            <p>Windows event viewer revealed I had hundreds of repetitious errors??</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these errors were Windows 8 errors? &nbsp;No solutions were posted that I could find?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to delete all the logs because event viewer filled up and choked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow and I had multiple data corruptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM fixed a few things but couldn't fix them all.<br />
</p>
<p>I did notice Windows Updater actually seemed to respond to DISM after reboot.</p>
<p>Windows Update did a lot of &nbsp;small downloads and fixed a few things.<br />
</p>
<p>Event viewer was working again but I was swamped with warnings and errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Updater is a persistent little devil, I will give it that.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that event viewer was reporting IPV6/Turedo errors so maybe an internet problem existed???<br />
<br />
I had downloaded a Windows 10 Pro ISO so I burnt a disk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not find a CRC value for the ISO download.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft should list</strong> the I<strong>SO CRC's&nbsp;</strong>on the downloads page. &nbsp;I did not see it and if it is present please increase the font size and &nbsp;put a big red arrow next to the download button pointing to it, check CRC after download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I supposed that my ISO was good because I successfully repaired windows and removed all the data corruptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I lost all my applications and settings however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some new errors, but they were not Window 8 errors and the IPV6/Teredo error was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fixed all the errors and warnings being reported by the event viewer. </p>
<p>note: RuntimeBroker caused other DCOM errors, so fixing it corrected them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am error free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will monitor the situation closely and I may have to do something about Windows Updater. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think helping it to install packages prevents re-installation attempts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use able to run Skyrim for a few minutes, its a notoriously slow loader because of all the files that it has to access, but at least it didn't take 5 minutes. &nbsp;T.B.D. &nbsp;</p>

 is past your receipt and beginning disposition of each together.</p>

 had to use Windows Explorer to copy all the eml files to a new directory for this hanging to stop. Wasted at least 8 hours fathoming it out. Useless piece of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM 2012 is not maintained, is used by many folk, there should be a health warning on it when you attempt to download it. HOPELESS.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Tenure</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p><p>Are there any gamers out there that are having issues with or that have questions about how Xbox Live tenure works? There are articles online to read for info but they are many years old.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I bring this up is that after returning to Gold Status on my account my tenure does not display as it used to before going Silver(This is an issue on Xbox One <b>NOT</b> on Xbox 360. On 360 tenure displays as it should).&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox support has given me conflicting&nbsp;answers and I, and maybe you would like an <b>updated</b> <b>official</b> answer!&nbsp;</p><p>Cheers</p>

            You can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO file to flash stick.  I'd make the bootable media so you have it for repairs or the vastly superior Clean Install if you want.   I would wait until Oct 17th when the Media Creation Tool will have the Fall Version latest media loaded and use it to Upgrade manually which is a more stable method anyway.   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

Meanwhile clean up the target PC as best possible using Disk Cleanup to include System Files, uninstall programs that are not wanted or used, move files off to storage if not needed:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12425/windows-10-free-up-drive-space
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10

Then plug in the latest media, open bootable meda or click on ISO to mount, right click Setup file to Run as Admin.  Follow prompts to Upgrade to latest version.  If it fails refer to http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/window

            First of all lets delete all unessesary updates that can take up quite a lot of space:

Lets try to delete the update from the system by trying this solution:

Go to This PC =&gt; Now open the C Drive =&gt; Go to Windows folder =&gt; Now find folder named Softwaredistribution =&gt;  open it =&gt; Open the folder called Download =&gt; now delete everything from there.

This should open up some free space, now run the update services again so it downloads the new version of windows and you should be fine.

Please let me know if it helped or not and i will gladly assist further.

<p>If the Windows 7 license originally came with your Dell, you can't transfer it, because it is an OEM license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had bought and installed the Windows 7 license separately and its retail copy, you can uninstall the key, then install it on the new desktop and use chat support to reactivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
At the command prompt, type: slmgr.vbs -upk<br />
<br />
Hit Enter, this will uninstall the product key from the computer and set it back to trial mode, you are now free to use it on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 7 on the new computer, you will need to use chat support to reactivate over the Internet:</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I enable join&#47;leave notifications in Skype for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris zammit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I enable join&#47;leave notifications in Skype for Business&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We need to enable entry/exit sounds for Skype calls in my organization. I have found three places to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In an active Skype meeting by going to Skype Meeting Options and then checking "Announce when people enter or leave"<br />
2) In the Office365 Portal, under Teams Admin portal, then Meetings, then Conference Bridges, then bridge settings, and on the right tab enable the toggle that says "Meeting Entry/Exit Notifications"<br />
3) In the Skype Legacy Portal under audio conferencing, then microsoft bridge settings, then check "Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on."<br />
</p>
<p>The problem is that none of these work. The local toggle within Skype for Business makes no discernable difference whether it's checked or not. I've tried creating a new meeting, restarting my computer, nothing makes a difference.<br />
</p>
<p>A global change at the Office 365/Teams admin portal would seem like the most effective approach, but I enabled this on Friday and still nothing. I have tried two different people's accounts trying to run a meeting, and the sound is not there, with or without
 their local setting enabled.<br />
</p>
<p>And the legacy portal just straight does not work. When I try to change the setting there, it simply tells me that it failed to make the change and to try again later.<br />
</p>

    <title>Host keyboard blocked after Remote Desktop session in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Host keyboard blocked after Remote Desktop session in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this problem from multiple computers at multiple locations. Both the host and the remote client are running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I connect to a computer with Remote Desktop, on the host, the computer I am connecting to, the keyboard stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning I can not log back into computer once I return to it, because I can not input anything with the keyboard.</p>
<p>All I can do is restart the computer and possibly loose unsaved work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried creating the shortcut to the command prompt in administrator mode with this command:
</p>
<p><span>%windir%\System32\tscon.exe 1 /dest:console</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This does log me out of the RDP session and brings back the unlocked desktop, but does not give me back the keyboard input.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I really hope someone finds an answer to this, I can not be the only one having this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

<h2>            Roblox on Xbox One is not showing up on the Xbox Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>I was really excited for roblox to come out on Xbox One. But for some reason its not showing up in the Xbox Marketplace! After I found that out I went and looked online for help. I could not find anybody with that issue so I went on to Xbox.com and searched
 it. Sure enough it popped up and I clicked download to xbox one. I restarted my Xbox One but It still didn't show up in the marketplace, ready to install or games and apps. Anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>At present it is only released in the US, so will only show in the US store. It won't appear in ready to install if your console is in a different region from the one you "purchased" from.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will release in other markets as well.</p>

<br />
I've also include a fourth file for you to look at. This text document shows information when the system attempts to start up repair and then fails. If I boot the computer again and begin in regular Windows Mode it tells me that the system has unexpectedly
 recovered and gives me the information in said text document.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for your time<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 Facial Recognition Lights Stay On Too Long&#63; Windows Hello Issue&#33;</h2>
                    Hello. I have a Surface Pro 6. The windows hello function seems to work okay, but once the computer is unlocked, the infrared light and the camera light stay on for an extra 5-10 seconds. Its a bit strange. Ive done all the recent updates, restarted the
 computer, and have re-done the windows hello facial recognition multiple times. Any clues why this happens or is this just mormal?&nbsp;

<p>wow, that seems to be weird. This only occurs to my previous Surface Pro 4. </p>
<p>Without seeing it I can't make sure what exactly is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Can you use camera while it's lit ? Try opening camera and switch to front facing camera, if so then this issue won't affect you too much (except it's annoying), but if it doesn't then this is a serious problem;</p>
<p>2<span>.When indicator it's lit, open Task Manager, make sure your CPU isn't overtasking (like 100%). this issue had happened to my previous Surface due to its CPU running at full speed.</span></p>
<p>3.Go to Device Manager, find Intel(R) AVStream Camera 2500, disable and re-enable it,
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e96045ed-ffe6-4291-a8fa-698e3523e211?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e96045ed-ffe6-4291-a8fa-698e3523e211?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>then check if this happen. if it does then uninstall it, without checking "Delete the driver software for this device" and reboot your PC;</p>
<p>4.Can you record a video about this, if possible ? just record with your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, the previous command I mentioned applies to version 1809, not version 1803. if changing service start up type affected anything, you can always change it back :</p>

    <title>Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop - Mouse is not Ergonomic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bsmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop - Mouse is not Ergonomic</h2>
                    <p>Purchased this on Saturday and worked with it all day. I like the small keyboard and the separate 10 key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse I tried adjustung to but today (Monday) &nbsp;after several hours working with it my arm and hand are exhausted to the point that my fingers are tingling. I contacted MS and after several transfers and a repeated call got the Hardware group. Contacted
 them to find out if there is something better or maybe to help identify why it is the way it is.&nbsp;I was asked to return the product from where I purchased and to find a better option from another manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To click on the mouse is to make a "click" click noise. It requires extra work to even make the click. I do not do a bit of typing and I do a lot of design. I am several programs at once. I click a lot. And I am fast. But this just slowed everything down.
 A real burden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product name is a misrepresentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - The mouse cannot be separated from the keyboard and vice versa. All or nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, - What Category is this to post to? I cannot locate.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> liamarble  say:</h3>
<h2>            microsoft account typo</h2>
                    I recently bought my laptop, and went through all of the steps to create a microsoft account, and then needed to exchange the laptop and go through the whole process again, and while doing so, made a typo in my email address without realizing, so I now
 have two microsoft accounts, and can't delete the incorrect one, because the account is sending verification codes to an email account that doesn't exist, and when I try to change the email address on the incorrect account, it tells me that it can't because
 that email address already exists with another microsoft account (my original account). I have tried several options, even going as far as to delete my correct microsoft account in order to correct the email address on my new account. I would really appreciate
 any advice, thanks.

            Hi Lia.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're able to sign into the incorrect account, do you see a link below the email at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info to Sign In with a Local Account?  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />If not create a new  Local Admin account to replace it and later once you retrieve the MS Account link to it:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>

<br />
<br />If you cannot change the incorrect account to Local, then once you sign into the new Account see if you can delete it at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/227763/how-to-completely-delete-your-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/227763/how-to-complet...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails type netplwiz in Start Search, right click to Run as Admin, tick the box to enter password, then the incorrect Account name, choose Remove, approve it, gone.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back them exactly and we'll work through them.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p><span>We appreciate your effort to provide us details about your issue. There is a possibility of data corruption but to make sure, kindly check this

<p>I guess the lesson is don't run defrag on your HDD unless you are on reliable AC power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has a Scheduled Task that runs defrag automatically every Wednesday at 1AM or as soon as it can after that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c140367f-9bb2-420b-8327-538b7028296f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c140367f-9bb2-420b-8327-538b7028296f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that the task will only run if the system is on AC power and will stop if the system switches to battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to run the defrag yourself you should pay attention to those conditions too - Windows has already figured out that it is not a good idea to run defrag unless the conditions are right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the built in defrag does a pretty good job by itself:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd182e8a-ec23-460e-8418-b6e314c3083f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd182e8a-ec23-460e-8418-b6e314c3083f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But some folks like to run their own defrag so if you adhere to the same conditions as the Windows task you would not have these issues or concerns.</p>

<h2>            Secondary skype command no longer works on Mac OS High Sierra</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to run a secondary Skype using the the following command:</p>
<p>open -na /Applications/Skype.app --args -DataPath /Users/$(whoami)/Library/Application\ Support/Skype2<br />

But instead of opening a secondary Skype like it used to one the previous version of MacOS Sierra, it just blinks and brings the already opened window to the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Running it with:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>sudo /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/MacOS/Skype /secondary<br />

works, but I would prefer doing it without running it as a super user.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>We highly suggested if you wish to run another account in one device you can open it using Skype for web:&nbsp;<a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a></p>
