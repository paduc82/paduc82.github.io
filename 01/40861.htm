<h2>            Printing gmail emails</h2>
                    <p>My husband has gmail (I have yahoo) so I'd like to know how to get a full printed page out to the right margin. As it is now, we can only print an email that starts near the center of the page and cuts off anything at the end of each line. I'd really like
 to help him because this is very frustrating. I know what to do in yahoo but not gmail. Please help!</p>

<h2>            windows 7 compatability with Epson R280 driver</h2>
                    <p>When I connect my Eposn R280 USB printer to my Win 7, 64 bit machine it doesn't recognize it correctly and will not install the correct driver.</p>
<p>When I manually select the printer driver or manually download it from Epson it will not load and run correctly.&nbsp; I get a message that states that there is an error in loading the driver.&nbsp; It alos gives the option for a Epson ESC/P Standard 2 Driver.&nbsp; This
 one it will download successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone familiar with why it will allow this driver to be installed but not the product specific driver?</p>

<h2>            iTunes and Ccleaner went missing after I updated Windows 10. All my restore points have vanished too.</h2>
                    <p>04/12/2015 @23:55</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes and Ccleaner just literally went missing after I did an update for Windows 10 about an hour ago. There's no short-cuts on the desktop for these programmes now. They are gone from the start menu too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ccleaner and all its files have completely vanished.</p>
<p>Some Apple stuff like bonjour and Apple software updates etc remains, but there is no functional iTunes. All the music settings have reverted to something called "Groove". The internet browser reverted back to Edge and Cortana has now been switched on, where
 previously it was switched off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my restore points have vanished too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I will just have to hope that no personal data has just been zapped away too ????</p>
<p>Now my whole evening has been ruined..... if not perhaps my whole computer ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened? All I did was re-start my computer like it asked to do.....</p>

            <p>Hello Krishna. Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I checked in the control panel, as well as by using file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would help if you read and then comprehend what I have written, rather than cutting and pasting useless and frustrating, inapplicable info !</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I did was allow a re-start to happen for Windows updates. When the computer re-started, there were entire programmes and files etc missing. Parts of iTunes disappeared too, thereby rendering iTunes inoperative. All my restore points were gone too. I
 have just spent the last 6 hours trying my best to fix this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft says that its updates don't affect customers' files....... well it just ruined (deleted) many of mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not Happy ! Should I send Microsoft an account for a $1000 for today's lost productivity ?</p>
<p>Perhaps not, cos while y'all very happy to take my cash..... you won't stand behind your product when it causes a catastrophic failure; will ya ?</p>

            I had this same exact thing happen, under the same circumstances. &nbsp;All that I have personally noticed missing is CCleaner, but it would take forever to check everything and I am not going to do that. &nbsp;I went to piriform to re-download CCleaner and after
 three attempts to install, all were failures. &nbsp;It never got past the "unpacking data" stage and usually showed 50-54%, never going past this or showing any response. &nbsp;What else has vanished? &nbsp;Need answers.

            <p>This happened to me on 7/1/2016.</p>
<p>Windows 10 update took approx.&nbsp;45 minutes with lots of "Please be patient" type screen messages.</p>
<p>When Windows 10 re-started, all tool bar icons were missing and even the start button wasn't working.
</p>
<p>After a couple of restarts, everything was back except that CCleaner and Speccy desktop shortcuts had disappeared. When I looked in the installed programs list, the programs had gone too.</p>
<p>Very worrying and not acceptable.</p>

    <title>External display is not working on Surface3 if connected via docking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vitaly minko  say:</h3>
<h2>            External display is not working on Surface3 if connected via docking station</h2>
                    <p>Surface 3 no longer detects external monitor when I connect it via docking station. Windows does not show any errors, the display just does not appear in the Display settings.</p>
<p>The problem appeared after Anniversary update (build 1607) followed by Surface 3 firmware update. In other words, it's a regression bug caused by recent Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I connect this external display via the same cable directly to Surface 3 (without docking station), then it woks fine. So I suppose that the driver for the docking station causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deep reboot of Surface 3 (hold the power button for 30 seconds), poweroff the docking station and the monitor. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Setup hardware description</strong>: Microsort Surface 3, Docking station for Surface 3, DELL 2713HM (with the default and the only firmware available), mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable (E301195, 1.8 meters).</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong>: Windows 10 build 1607 with the latest updates available.</p>

            <p>Hi Vitaly, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for trying some steps in order to get the issue fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your
 computer was installed correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Surface 3 no longer detects external monitor when connecting it via docking station, as an Initial troubleshooting step I would request you to perform the
<strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </strong>and then check if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Press <strong><span>Windows logo </span></strong>to open the search box.<br />
<strong>b:</strong> Type<strong> troubleshooting</strong>, hit enter.<br />
<strong>c:</strong> Now click <strong>Hardware and sound.</strong><br />
<strong>d:</strong> Now click <strong>Hardware and devices </strong>and then click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with external monitor not getting detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            Hello again. I did a deep reboot once again and now Windows does see another monitor in the Device settings, but it can't recognize any properties (like resolution, brightness, etc). The external monitor still does not get any video signal and goes to
 sleep mode.

<p>
</p><p>The device manager shows correct display (DELL 2713HM) and thinks that the display works properly. Tried to reinstall display drivers, nothing changed.</p>

            <p>I am having the exact same problems on my Surface Book with Dell U2415h x 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts to fix all without success:</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Fresh install of Windows 10 (Redstone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Manual firmware update of Surface Dock 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Installation of latest monitor drivers from Dell</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Disabling of nVidia graphics chip (can't disable Intel graphics as nVidia chip does not support external monitors)</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Direct connection to Surface Book (bypassing doc station)</p>
<p>&nbsp;-mDP to HDMI converter (both active &amp; passive with HDMI 2.0 compatible highspeed cable)<br />
&nbsp;-mDP to DP &nbsp;cable (single cable, no converter)<br />
&nbsp;-mDP to HDMI cable (single cable, no converter)</p>
<p>&nbsp;-All the usual windows troubleshooting;</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Scan for changes</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Delete devices &amp; scan for changes</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Delete devices, restart (both connected and disconnected)</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Disable/enable monitors and other hardware</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Reboot disconnected, connect single device at a time</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Reboot connected</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Built in Troubleshooting prompt dialog process</p>
<p>&nbsp; --Repeat in Safemode</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Countless hours of other **** and pretty much every suggestion I could find on the web.<br />
</p>
<p>As additional information everything was working perfect prior to anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it seems pretty clear that the issue is with Microsoft and this version of Windows. All of our workstations are running Windows 10 without the Anniversary update without any of these problems with external monitors. As we have many surface
 books and surface pros in addition to the workstations, we will skip this update and wait another year for the next release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has had this issue and was able to find a solution, I'd appreciate any input.</p>

            <p>I tried to downgrade Windows from 1607 to previous build. It didn't help.</p>
<p>Then I reinstalled Windows 10 from scratch and, lo and behold, the external display
<strong>started working again</strong>.</p>
<p>Then I tried to apply all Windows updates again in order to verify whether Windows updates break the external display support.&nbsp; And now I have exactly the same issue as described above. So IMHO it's quite obvious that problem is caused by the latest Windows
 updated.</p>

            Looks like I should pay more attention. I skipped the part where you had shared the dumps.
<br />Anyway, the crashes are related to BitDefender Antivirus.
<br />Remove BitDefender and use Windows Defender in its place. Use the removal tool from the link below.

<p>The storage folders in our computer disappeared recently ... all the folders with useful information had disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always easier to help when there is a comprehensive and precise problem description.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
&nbsp;
<li>Is it <em>all</em> storage folders that have disappeared? Is the heading Storage folders visible in the folder pane? If not, enable its display by clicking the button on the View tab.<br />
</li><li>Is it only some of the folders under Storage folders that have disappeared? Are the special folders still there (<em>Drafts, Sent items, Deleted items</em>)?&nbsp;If the missing folders are user-created ones, are they all missing or only some of them?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Is there any way that hidden folders that have disappeared can be retrieved?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folders that 'go missing' have usually either been moved inadvertently or recovered after a database corruption. The easiest way to find them again is to press Ctrl-Y to see the entire folder tree. Recovered folders may well be several levels deep inside
 a folder called <em>Recovered items</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Could the disappearance be due to windows having updated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No; I can think of no way that Windows Update could affect the Windows Live Mail store folder.</p>

<p>The storage folders in our computer disappeared recently ... all the folders with useful information had disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always easier to help when there is a comprehensive and precise problem description.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
&nbsp;
<li>Is it <em>all</em> storage folders that have disappeared? Is the heading Storage folders visible in the folder pane? If not, enable its display by clicking the button on the View tab.<br />
</li><li>Is it only some of the folders under Storage folders that have disappeared? Are the special folders still there (<em>Drafts, Sent items, Deleted items</em>)?&nbsp;If the missing folders are user-created ones, are they all missing or only some of them?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Is there any way that hidden folders that have disappeared can be retrieved?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folders that 'go missing' have usually either been moved inadvertently or recovered after a database corruption. The easiest way to find them again is to press Ctrl-Y to see the entire folder tree. Recovered folders may well be several levels deep inside
 a folder called <em>Recovered items</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Could the disappearance be due to windows having updated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No; I can think of no way that Windows Update could affect the Windows Live Mail store folder.</p>

<p>Hmmm. You originally wrote&nbsp;<em>Looking in storage folders again, there are, <strong>
within deleted items</strong>, some recovered folders which have one or two emails within most of them ...
</em>I assume you call them 'recovered folders' because they are within a folder called
<em>Recovered items</em> - correct? Otherwise, why do you refer to them as <em>recovered</em>? I should have thought that stuff in the
<em>Deleted items</em> folder was anything but recovered ...</p>
<p>Any folders recovered after a database corruption will be placed in a folder called
<em>Recovered items</em>. There may be more than one such folder, newer ones having a serial number suffix in brackets, like
<em>Recovered items (1)</em>.&nbsp; If a <em>Recovered items </em>folder exists, it will not be empty unless you emptied it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Correct, recovered folders are within deleted items. Nothing had been emptied. One day all the folders were there, the next day this weird occurrence took place.</p>
<p>So, if there was a corruption of the database, would that be due to the computer itself? It is within a one year warranty.</p>

<p>I was wondering what you found when you used the <em>Go to folder </em>function (Ctrl-Y). You still haven't said whether the 'recovered folders' you&nbsp;found were within a folder called
<em>Recovered items </em>or not, or indeed whether there is a folder called <em>Recovered items</em>. A folder with this name will be created by the program in the event of a database corruption*, so its presence or absence is a clear indication of whether
 there has been such a corruption or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another common reason for missing folders and messages is accidentally dragging them to another folder. Ctrl-Y will show you whether this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; Database corruption most often happens when the program's housekeeping process is interrupted. Housekeeping takes place after the program has been closed down, so it's important to wait a few minutes after closing down before switching off the computer
 or re-launching the program. It can also be caused by third-party security software.</p>

</p><p>My apologies, too, &nbsp;for not saying what happened when I did "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ctrl-Y"; when I did this, &nbsp;I saw exactly as previously when I had clicked on storage folders, imported etc and &nbsp;saw the odd few emails within

<p>A game I have purchased and wish to play needs .NET Framework 3.5 to operate. &nbsp;During installation, the GUI tells me, "Use 'Turn Windows Features on or off to install or configure .NET framework...'" &nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked both boxes the the sub-menu under the .NET Framework heading.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After a while, i get this error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An error has&nbsp;occurred. &nbsp;Not all of the features were&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;changed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So after browsing so called "Solutions" &nbsp;all over the web, i typed this into an administrative command window:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:WCF-HTTP-Activation</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>which&nbsp;yields&nbsp;this result:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The operation comleted, but WCF-HTTP-Activation feature was not enabled. &nbsp;Ensure that the following parent feature(s) are enabled first. &nbsp;If they are already enabled, refer to the log file for further diagnostics.</div>
<div>NetFx3</div>
<div>The DISM log file can be found at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>NetFx3 is in the feature list, so I attempted to Enable that as well. &nbsp;In the command window I typed:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Which&nbsp;yielded&nbsp;this result:</div>

<div>After a quick search, I discovered that NetFx3 is the name of the .NET framework itself. &nbsp;I ran a cleanup tool to attempt to remove .NET framework and downloaded the .NET framework 3.0 from Microsoft. &nbsp;A few minutes into the install process, a dialogue
 box popped up saying, "Use 'Turn Windows Features on or off to install or configure .NET framework...'"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And now, you see, we are back to square one of the frustrating cycle. &nbsp;Being a student, I do not have the funds&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to upgrade or&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;windows, which will be my last ditch effort to resolve this and other issues.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can shed light on this issue, please do so, and do your best to use correct grammar and spelling. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

    <title>Another Slow Internet Download Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flashnob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another Slow Internet Download Problem</h2>
                    <p>I've looked at previous questions about similar "slow download speed" and none of the suggested fixes has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Desktop PC on wired Ethernet</strong></span> has slowed to a crawl. Before January 15, 2018 my download rate average was 126.7 Mbps. Since January 15. my average download rate has been reduced to 33.6 Mbps
 and sometimes much worse (~9 Mbps) using Chrome, IE or MS Edge. However, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>my Wifi download and upload rates remain high on both my Samsung Galaxy S7 and two HP laptops</strong></span> at 50 - 120Mbps. I've been using speedtest.net (OOKLA) to measure the download speeds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed the configuration over this time period. My PC is a stock Gateway LX6200-01 with:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>AMD Phenom 9500 Quad-Core CPU;</span></li><li><span>Win 10Pro 1709 </span></li><li><span>8 GB of memory; and</span></li><li><span>Marvell Yukon 88E8071 PCI-E Gigabit Controller.</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p>My network consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Comcast/Xfinity Cable/Voice/Internet Wifi modem</span></li><li><span>D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts, since there web pages open really slow. Any ideas on what the problem might be and how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            If it is just affecting your internet applications, are you having the same problem with other computers on your network? Are you able to connect directly to your router or modem with a wire just to see the result.

</p><p>My problem does not appear to be WiFi related since my desktop is wired to my Gig Ethernet Switch (see original post). Just to be sure, I tried several configurations using the desktop, laptop and my Samsung GS7 connected to the Switch, Modem and Wifi as
 appropriate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I saw for download speeds this afternoon:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop (Enet/Switch)</p>
<p>30.83 Mbps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP Laptop (Wifi)</p>
<p>51.93 Mbps &amp; 91.86Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HP Laptop</span> (Enet/Modem)</p>
<p>79.16 Mbps &amp; 77.77</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>HP Laptop</span> (Enet/Switch)</p>
<p>90.61Mbps &amp; 95.55Mbps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Uninstall/reinstall your sound card drivers. Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

</p><p>I have checked and found no solution. </p>
<p>Actually I contacted the laptop manufacturer who has clearly informed me that there are no drivers in windows 10 for my Bluetooth hardware.
</p>
<p>The Bluetooth hardware manufacturer does not have any drivers available also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly speaking Microsoft should have asked hardware manufacturers to have device drivers available prior to releasing windows 10 to avoid such problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its frustrating with little solutions insight at this point.</p>

            <p>Hi Le Boule,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Vista and after having to verify my login credentials (which occurs sometimes and not other times - haven't quite figured out why it changes), I am now staring at the MMPC.&nbsp; I've navigated it and am having no problems.&nbsp; OOPS.&nbsp; See Edit below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not quite sure where exactly it belongs, but at the very least if it is here (vs.&nbsp;the networking&nbsp;forum or&nbsp;the&nbsp;IE&nbsp;forum if using IE) rather than Feedback (which I have to say I think is not the right place as the issue isn't with Answers but with a totally
 different website), it&nbsp;should at the very least be moved to the Vista forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; MMPC is here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/</a>&nbsp;for those who don't know what that means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.P.S.&nbsp; Perhaps changing the title to "Unable to access Microsoft's malware security website" and changing the content to "I cannot access
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/</a>&nbsp;which is the Microsoft Malware Protection Center using &lt;insert browser&gt;.&nbsp; I'm not having problems with other sites.&nbsp; Is this an issue with the
 site or my connection or my browser?&nbsp; I don't see how it could be my login credentials since I'm posting here just fine" might also help expedite a response.&nbsp; I suspect many here don't know what MMPC means and technically, if nobody else is having the problem,
 the lack of responses may indicate just that as you really didn't ask how to fix the problem.&nbsp; Frankly, I'd try rebooting and see if that does the trick as it will break the login links and perhaps resolve what is simply bad login credentials being used for
 some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{EDIT:&nbsp; I just had troubles myself and closed the tab and tried with another tab and it worked.&nbsp; I then had troubles again with an extremely slow response and then it finally worked.&nbsp; Then same as the first time again (or I wasn't patient enough).&nbsp; I believe
 they're either overwhelmed or having problems with their servers.}</p>

    <title>Xbox Party Invite Notification not being received by anyone on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack over ice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Party Invite Notification not being received by anyone on my Friends List.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi everyone.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have a problem and hope you can help?<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the past three days any Party Invites that I initiate/send from my Xbox One X are not being received by anyone on my friends list.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am getting the notification that the Party Invite has been sent, just no one receives a notification on their end.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried the same with sending messages and that notification is received fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can send a Party Invite using the Xbox App on my mobile and that is also received OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The party at my end starts up correctly and people can join no worries, they just do not receive the invite.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have tried with a few friends on my list and all the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My NAT is open, my network is wired and my power is not set to 'Instant-On'.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have done hard resets with the power cable taken out, I have reset my modem, and I have reset my Alternate MAC address and also cleared out Persistent Storage.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have signed out and back in as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have also cycled all notifications OFF/ON.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Everything worked fine up until 3 or 4 days ago and without me changing any settings I cannot now invite friends to party.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have any ideas?</span></p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>Hello Jack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bring this to our attention. Since the account is able to send party invites on other platforms, I recommend performing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory reset while keeping games and apps.</a> Redownload your profile to the xbox one afterwards, so make sure to have the login info handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this works!</p>

<p>Yeah, that site is pretty funny. I'm even in there in the May section lol. I'm surprised more of mine were not there considering that I go out of my way to be a d-bag. : D</p>
<p>Oh, and I think they were saying something about wanting larger maps in MW3. They were also talking about "hotspots" and stuff like that. I'd find the info for you guys, but I just don't feel like it right now. I think I read about that on Kotaku?</p>

<h2>            Unable to create a System Image to external hard drive using  Backup and Restore &#40;Windows 7&#41; under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else had problems using Backup and Restore (Windows 7) in Windows 10 to create a System Image on an external hard disk since early November 2016. Prior to this date I had no problem creating a System Image once a month. Now the software fails
 to recognise the external hard drive for some reason. There is nothing wrong with the hard drive as I can store other files on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that one of Microsoft's many updates to Windows 10 in November 2016 has upset something.</p>

            <p>Can't help you with Windows System Image because I use third-party imaging software. Most third-party software has more features than Windows System Image and is easier to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imaging once a month is not sufficient, quite frankly. You should be making images daily, at the least. With a third-party product you can easily schedule images to run automatically, overnight. You can create and save multiple image jobs and set a retention
 schedule. And you can easily verify the integrity of images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, many imaging applications let you restore images to dissimilar hardware, mount images for review and boot them in a virtual machine, among other capabilities. And many imaging products also backup files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows System Image can't do these things as well (or at all); on the other hand, Microsoft is not in the imaging business. Windows System Image provides only a basic level of protection, for people who don't know how to install and configure third-party
 software.</p>

<h3> rajithmaligaspe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony Vegas Pro 11 shows only audio templates for rendering</h2>
                    Hey there.&nbsp;
<div>I have Sony Vegas Pro 11 running on Windows 7 64-Bit.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I do many projects as home movies...&nbsp;</div>
<div>I just completed a home movie with several audio &amp; video clips with transparent title text clips and i wanted to render it. But when I click 'Render As', only render template for audio is shown, in the choice of '.flac', '.ac3', '.aif', '.mp3', '.ogg',
 '.pca', '.wav', and 'w64'... The render window doesn't show any video rendering templates (my usual rendering template is '.wmv'...&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This isnt my first project and this is a re-edit of a movie (with fresh un-edited clips) that I already have rendered using sony vegas pro.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The project settings for the movie is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cinematic Widescreen (my custom template) - 1920x786'</div>
<div>Frame rate - 24.000 fps</div>
<div>Stereoscopic 3D mode - off</div>
<div>Field Order - Upper Field first</div>
<div>Pixel aspect ratio - 1.0000 Square</div>
<div>Output Rotation - 0% 'original'</div>
<div>Pixel Format - 8-Bit</div>
<div>Compositing Gamma - 2.222 video (default and not choosable)</div>
<div>Full resolution Rendering quality - best</div>
<div>Motion blur type - Gaussian</div>
<div>Deintelace methods - Blend fields</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me what might be wrong with my project?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hey I know this is super old but maybe my suggestions will help someone anyways. What I found is that when you try to export a sound clip or prioritize a sound clip Sony Vegas will automatically assume that the entire project is for sound only; even if you
 add your video clips and effects in afterwards. This makes it super annoying when you try to render your video project and you only can see the audio rendering options. After you have clicked on "<strong>Render As</strong>", you might find that the options
 you have are all audio templates. To change that simply click on the little blue link underneath the "<strong>Browse....</strong>" button that says "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>More Filter Options</strong></span>". You then should see a
 bunch of options appear underneath <strong>Output Format:</strong></p>
<p>Tick the box next to "Video templates only" and voila! All of your video options are back! Worked Great For me hope I could help you because this really frustrated me after working on my project all day LOL.</p>

            No, Windows Easy Transfer does not support transfering from 64 bit to 32 bit, only 32 to 64 bit. You will have to manually backup your personal files and settings on the old laptop to a CD/DVD or external hard disk and copy them over to Windows 7 Starter.

            Programs cannot be be transferred, you will have to reinstall them. If you are referring to the executable s for the programs to reinstall them, yes, that can be done.
