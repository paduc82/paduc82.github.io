<h2>            Connecting two monitors to the Surface Pro 2 with Surface Docking station, can it be done and how&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to connect two external monitors to the Surface Pro 2 using the Surface New Docking station? Connecting 1 is easy. Talked to Microsoft via chat and they say it could but gave no other info.

You have 2 choices, if your monitor support Display Port 1.2 and daisy chaining, you can plug a mini-DP to DP cable into one Monitor and plug the DP out from one Monitor to the other.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your other option is to use the mini-DP to HDMI and/or VGA to one monitor and buy a USB 3.0 Video Adapter and run the additional monitor from there. (Unless you already have Display Port Monitors the USB option is the least expensive).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are some choices for the USB Video Adapters:</p>

            Microsoft removed these games by design from Windows 8 and they are not available period. You can go to the store app and there are plenty of solitare games available-try Microsoft Solitaire Collection- I am sure you will find something to your liking,
 but if not your other choice would be to search the web for a third party App.&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

Very disappointed </p>
<p>. I took a chance that Windows 8 was not as bad as people say. But, it is worse! I wasted $1000&nbsp; on a new HP 4th Generation Intell processor and this Windows&nbsp;8 is not friendly at all. I used a transfer cable and none of my old programs run and the data is
 just taking up space. Don't know if I can get my money back or not. It is just like Obama care, you will have to pay for every piece of junk software that is out there with no standards to go by.&nbsp;I finally downloaded some solitaregames from the store but they
 are junk and do not have the features. After I played it the first time it&nbsp; was very hard to get it to play the next time. It had ADS running the hole time I did play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very dissatisfied!!</p>

            <p>Did you try the Microsoft Solitaire game in the store?&nbsp; They had it contracted to be built and it's very functional, beautiful, and free.&nbsp; It includes classic Solitaire, plus the old favorites like Hears and Freecell from Windows XP days, and a&nbsp;lot more.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 will work with any program built for Windows 7 also, so please feel free to let us know what compatibility problems you have and we'd be happy to help.</p>

<p>PS. Games were excluded so you didn't have to install things you don't want: only the core system is included and people who don't want games don't have to have them.</p>

            <p>Indeed there was, primarily from IT departments but also from users that didn't want to download and install games -- or any optional component -- unless they specifically wanted it.&nbsp; This is why the
<em>Programs and Features</em> control panel was built to provide optional install of functionality.&nbsp; In addition, this allows programs to be updated more often than with Service Packs tied to the operating system, which has a slower update cycle.&nbsp; Finally
 it allows for more agile development and choice of apps to use because you have user choice from a larger selection of games, none of which are preselected for you.</p>

            <p>Sorry Shawn, your argument does not wash.</p>
<p>IT departments (under instruction from management) did not want their trusted and valued employees playing games on company computers, on company time.&nbsp; So the response was to ignore what home PC users were quite content with, rather than have IT tell&nbsp;employees
 not to play games.</p>
<p>The games now available require internet access, along with logins and bombardment with unsolicited advertising.&nbsp; Internet access and availability is not as available in the rest of the world as it is in the US.</p>
<p>What's coming next - MS Office requiring internet logins?</p>

            <p>Microsoft makes a LOT more money from companies than from people buying computers at home. They also make money from those ads you mentioned. And Microsoft Office 365 does require an Internet login, and it is widely expected that the "standalone" versions
 of Office that aren't subscription based will be discontinued in the near future.&nbsp; So yes.</p>

            There also is another difference in Office 365 subscriptions, that is subscriptions get upgrades or added features first and according to Microsoft there may ever be features or updates that are only available to the subscription client.&nbsp;Hope this helps
 and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>i'm hoping someone on here will know what to do and will be kind enough to help me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
OS: 7<br />
Hardware: Biostar H55 HD motherboard &amp; Intel G6950 processor (for HD graphics)<br />
<br />
i have my pc connected to a full hd lcd tv by hdmi. yesterday i switched the tv off before the pc. when i realised my mistake and switched it back on Windows had suddenly gone 'letterbox' (black bars at top &amp; bottom only).<br />
<br />
the tv says it's still receiving a 1920x1080 signal and windows says it's still giving out a 1920x1080 signal. i have tried changing resolution on the pc but it had no effect. i tried changing channels on the tv and different zoom levels but it's still letterboxed.
 curiously enough the letterboxing only takes effect when the desktop opens. boot screen etc is filling the screen perfectly.<br />
<br />
i have disconnected and reconnected the hdmi lead and it's still happening. i've tried fiddling around in the 'Graphics Properties' on the right-click menu on the desktop but it has no effect. i have changed hdmi lead and inputs on the tv but nothing seems
 to change it back.<br />
<br />
a system restore had no effect.<br />
<br />
anyone have any clue what the problem might be? please if anyone could help it's be appreciated. i don't really want to have to do a clean install as there is 2TB of stuff on the C drive.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi heilanner,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried changing the aspect ratio setting on your HD LCD TV?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem seems to be the aspect ratio mismatch on your LCD TV. The aspect ratio on the computer is not matching with the aspect ratio on your
 TV.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the widescreen TVs utilize the 16:9 aspect ratio since this is the default widescreen size used for HDTV broadcasts. If you are
 watching a widescreen broadcast on your HDTV, then it should be in the 16:9 ratio and therefore should fill up your screen rather than displaying black bars on Top and bottom of the display.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Change the aspect ratio on your TV</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the manual that came with your TV to see how to change the video settings on your TV. You may need to change
 the video settings on your television to get the display correctly. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can change the display settings on your HDTV through your computer by following the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Display Settings by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose
 the monitor that you want to change settings for, adjust the display settings, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<br />
To select different display settings for one or more displays</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>At the bottom of the New Display Detected dialog box, click Display.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>The Display Settings dialog box opens, where you can change screen resolution, refresh rate, and color depth.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>hi Mouneshwar, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's not the tv. i know this as the pc connects to it via an amp/receiver. i also have a blu-ray and hd dvd player connected through this using the same output and they are both fine. that aside, as i said in the OP i have tried different zoom levels/aspect
 ratios on the tv but the display is still letterboxed. all that happened when i changed aspect ratio was the size of the black bars changed and i either lost the edges of the display or gained pillarbox black bars at the side too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my tv is set by default to 1:1 mapping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have already tried the steps you described for changing display settings. it unfortunately only changes the size of the icons etc on the desktop. the black bars remain the same. the settings i have are as follows: Display<strong>Sony AV Amp</strong>, Resolution:
<strong>1920x1080 (recommended)</strong>, Orientation:<strong>Landscape</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have also tried different hdmi cables and connected both via the av amp and direct to the tv. i have also tried different hdmi inputs on the tv. all give the same result; windows (displaying 1920x1080) with letterboxing black bars at the top and bottom
 of the screen.</p>

    <title>How to change individual elements of Windows 7 Display&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itisonlyi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change individual elements of Windows 7 Display&#63;</h2>
                    Running Win 7 64 Bit<br />
<br />
How can I change the individual elements of windows?<br />
<br />
In XP there was a way to do this. I could click on the part I wanted to change, and make whatever changes I wanted. I could use different fonts for different parts of the window, change the color of the Title bar, without changing all the colors of the rest
 of the window.<br />
<br />
When I first got Win 7, and was exploring the interface, I thought I had encountered the old XP interface for doing this, but now I can't find it.<br />
<br />
All advice gratefully received.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Steve

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the network adapter and update it with the latest driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</p>
<p>i. Click start-&gt; Type Device Manager in the Search bar.<br />
ii. In Device Manager, locate the device under network adapters, and then right-click the device name.<br />
iii. Select uninstall and restart the computer.<br />
iv. Let vista detect the device and install the drivers by itself.<br />
v. If that does not help, install the latest drivers for the network adapter from the manufacturer‚Äôs website</p>
<p>Check the link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<pre>Salut √† tous,&nbsp;</pre>

<pre>mon coeur penche pour la xbox one,&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>mais je suis quand m√™me d√©gout√© quand j'apprends que mon casque Tritton Warhead 7.1 √† 280 ‚Ç¨ ne sera pas 100% compatible Xbox One,&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>alors qu'il utilise une techno certifi√© microsoft pour la synchro du micro-casque.</pre>

<pre>Est ce que Microsoft va se bouger le cul pour ceux qui ont d√©bours√© cette somme assez importante pour rendre le Warhead 7.1 compatible avec leur Xbox One ?</pre>

<pre>D√©sol√© si je n'ai pas post√© au bon endroit mais je n'ai pas trouv√© d'endroit ad√©quate.</pre>

<pre>Merci de me r√©pondre.</pre>

<pre>Surtout pour le CM de chez Microsoft - Xbox.</pre>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
At launch no 3rd party headsets will work properly with the Xbox One. You will need an adapter that will be sold for the Xbox One controller after launch. You should be able to hear using the headset because it still uses an optical cable, you just won't be
 able to use the microphone to talk to others.<br />
<br />
That's the most information that's currently out. For further information you'll need to ask your headset manufacturer Tritton.<br />
<br />
<strong>Translation:<br />
<br />
</strong>Bonjour,<br />
<br />
Lors de son lancement aucun 3e casques parti fonctionneront correctement avec le Xbox One. Vous aurez besoin d'un adaptateur qui sera vendu pour le seul contr√¥leur Xbox apr√®s le lancement. Vous devriez √™tre capable d'entendre en utilisant le casque, car il
 utilise toujours un c√¢ble optique, vous serez tout simplement pas en mesure d'utiliser le micro pour parler √† d'autres.<br />
<br />
C'est le plus l'information qui est actuellement en rupture. Pour plus d'informations, vous devez demander √† votre fabricant casque Tritton.</p>

<h2>            Installing Realtek 8185 Driver from Windows Update results in system crash</h2>
                    
<p>Installing the Realtek 8185 Extensible 802.11b/g Wireless Device Driver&nbsp;listed as optional in windows update in windows 7 ultimate 64 bit results in BSOD and system becomes unable to boot (system restore will fix it).<br />
<br />
I'm posting this to see if this is a particular situation with my system or if it is a widespread problem, driver details listed below.<br />
<br />
Device works fine with default driver, so if anyone is going to tell me don't install that driver and look for another that is not the issue. Issue is that this driver in Windows update will cause crash (BSOD) and system will not boot until system restore is
 used.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to go to Realtek and get the current driver, it works fine on my system. Not doing that just<br />
means you are stuck in the loop you are in and the driver Windows Updates is trying to install is an<br />
old one that just got Windows Certified (MS is far behind certifying drivers and certification does not<br />
mean they work properly).<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<h2>            Error message &#34;Wi-Fi doesn&#39;t have a valid IP configuration&#34;</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: WiFi errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am continuously facing an issue with my WiFi (Realtek RTL8723BE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC).</p>
<p>I had tried almost everything :</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalled my Wifi driver</li><li>msconfig etc. etc. using cmd</li><li>updating driver and all the solution being provided here and there...</li></ul>
<p>At first it was showing that IP configuration not ok...I used to troubleshoot it and then it would work properly.</p>
<p>Then after talking to Digisol(my router customer care) they suggested me to change the IP config.</p>
<p>After changing to manual IP configuration now after every 10 to 15 mints an exclamatory mark again shows up and when I troubleshoot it either it shows :</p>
<ul>
<li>the default gateway is not available, or</li><li>The connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the Internet is broken</li></ul>
<p>I am helpless and don't want to reinstall my windows 8.1.</p>
<p>HELP<br />
PS : I am using a Lenovo G5070 Model name 20351 with Windows 8.1 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>here are the snapshots after troubleshooting.</p>

<br />You should upgrade to 1809 through Media creation tool using below method. Execute the below steps to go to 1809 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)

            Hi Mabolghar ,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>there seems to be a few variants - <a href="http://interplay.com/games/battlechess.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://interplay.com/games/battlechess.php</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if its the old DOS version ( see the list here <a href="http://interplay.com/support/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://interplay.com/support/index.php</a> ) you <em>may </em>get it running in a DOS emulator like (free)

<p>

                    <p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span><b>FYI: Using Netgear with Windows&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>I have a HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 8 64 bit and Netgear N 300,WNR2000v3. I learned after hours of phone calls to Netgear and Microsoft and emails to Netgear support
 that I couldn‚Äôt use my Netgear without restarting it each time I turned on my computer. Netgear does not have a software update for Windows 8. It was totally frustrating experience. I just purchased the Netgear in March when I signed up for Cable internet
 service. The Netgear was for wireless connection. At the time, I had Windows 7 and no problems with connection. I don‚Äôt want to spend money on a new Netgear router especially when they may not have one compatible with Windows 8.
</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the communication I had with them. Hopefully, it will prevent someone else having to go through the same experience.</span></p>

<p><b><span>I don''t know what adapter I am using. I have Netgear 14 WNR 2000v3. I have it hooked up with my Charter Cable. I did get connected
 but I think it may be without security because I saw a memo that I could connect by turning off the Netgear. I did that and unplugged it and the cable attached to my cable TV. When I turned it back on and rebooted my computer it connected. I think I saw a
 memo that it would not be a secure network However, since I couldn''t find any driver nor would the password work, I decided if I want a connection, I will have to chance it. So, if this information tells you what adapter I may have, let me know and I will
 go to that link. Thank you, Sue </span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Still having problems. I have been able to connect with my Windows 7 notebook but not windows 8 unless I unplug the router every time
 I start up my computer. Today I lost internet access and had to reset my modem before I could connect. Office depot told me to purchase DLink as I needed it for Windows 8. However, one of your techs said I didn''t need that. I can connect with my Netbook Windows
 7 without resetting my net gear but not with Windows 8. Yesterday the Technician at Net Gear did get me connected but then this morning not only didn''t it work but it had no internet connection with the Modem. Someone from Charter helped me get the modem
 set and the Netgear. I talked with Microsoft and they said the problem is Net gear doesn''t have the correct settings for Windows 8. I notice on Microsoft community message boards that others have been having the same problem with Netgear and Windows 8. The
 technician at Microsoft and I looked at the firmware downloads for my version of netgear. There are no instructions on which of the 5 downloads I should use. I am a Senior Citizen living on Soc Sec and can''t afford to pay for premium services nor should I
 have to just because of an incompatibility between Net Gear and Windows 8. I am leaving my internet on all day today just to keep my connection but I can''t do this all night. Sue B O''Dea</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Since I was still having problems by having to turn off the Netgear and then back on after 10 seconds everytime I start up my computer
 in order to connect, I reread through everything, purchased an addtional ethernet cord to I can start from scratch to connect by using a cord for modem to netgear and netgear to computer. I also, downloaded the recommended firmware. This is what I got -</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>WNA1100 Setup_v2/1/02, WNA11_v2.1.0.202,</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>zip file, WNA1100_StandAlone_V1/1/02, WNA1100_V2.1_0.2_ReleaseNote.
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>I opened the first file to install and my computer went black. I had to restart it twice in order for it to open up. Since that happened,
 I don''t want to try to install any of the remaining files and am uninstalling the first file. I hesitate to try and connect and reinstall the netgear for fear I will completely lose the connection.

<p><b><span>Since you already bought another ethernet cable and have connected your Windows 8 computer to your router using this ethernet cable,

<p><b><span>Using the ethernet to connect to my computer is not the solution. The only reason I purchased it is because of instructions I found
 on your web page that said I needed it to set up my net gear. Apparently, i was supposed to connect the ethernet from my netgear to the modem and another to connect to my computer to set it up. I can''t keep it set up that way because there I no where close
 to that that I can sit comfortably and use the computer. I would have to sit on the floor in front of the TV. That is not an option. I tried to follow the instructions and got as far as the window where you sign in as admin and use password "password". There
 was supposed to be a link on there for the install wizard but that never appeared. I gave up and just went back to using it online the way I always do by turning off the netgear and my computer then turning the netgear back on and booting up my computer. Apparently,
 it has to reset everytime i want to connect to the internet. </span></b></p>

<p><b><span>I spoke to a Microsoft technician who connected with my computer. He looked through the software I downloaded and the installation.
 He went in to his own computer using his Netgear that was the same version as mine. He was using his windows 8. He found out that there was no way to make it compatible with Windows 8. I just purchased the Netgear in March and I am a Senior Citizen living
 on Social Security- a very limited income. So, I am not about to purchase a new set. There should have been software to upgrade this to work with Windows 8. I will just continue to turn it off and back on again everytime I boot up my computer to go on the
 internet. However, I am going to put a complaint with CNet about this lack of software for windows 8.

<p><b><span>I have an HP Pavilion Laptop with Windows 8 64 bit. Office Depot told me I needed a DLink adapter with Windows 8. I purchased it but
 it wasn''t any help. Microsoft told me I didn''t need that because Windows had it''s own adapter. So, I removed the DLink. However the technician at Microsoft checked the issue and said that my Netgear wasn''t compatible with Windows 8. He had a version of
 Netgear that was the same as mine. He tried it with his Windows 8 and said it wouldn''t work with his windows 8 unless he did just what I do which is to turn it off, back on and then boot up the computer. It was at that point I decided I would just continue
 to do as I have been doing as I can''t afford to purchase a new one. The Netgear works fine with my Netbook a Gateway with Windows 7. My old laptop, a Toshiba with Windows 7 32 bit worked fine with the Netgear. So, it is the Windows 8 that doesn''t work with
 it. I don''t think there is much that can be done. I followed the directions provided and if you look back you can see the software that came up to download and that there were three files. I downloaded the first one. Hooked up the eithernet with the computer
 and the Netgear followed all the instructions and then reached the point where I put in the password but the Install Wizard option never came up. The Microsoft tech did the same and had the same problem. So, I don''t think there is anything more that can be
 done. </span></b></p>

            I have a similar issue using -- if that term even applies -- Windows 8.1.  I have an older NETGEAR WNR1000 wireless router and just bought a pricey Lenovo notebook (beautiful actually -- I have no beef with Lenovo).  Could not connect to internet and when I opened Device Manager and searched for network drivers by manufacturer there was no 802.11 based driver listed.  How the **** those nitwits in Redmond shipped a steaming pile of **** like this escapes.  The guys at Apple must buy the latest windows, smoke a joint (not sure but is in the Bay Area), and just laugh their asses off at the incompetence of the LARGEST SOFTWARE COMPANY IN THE WORLD !!!!  Just defies belief. Windows 8.1 is not just bad -- it is STUNNINGLY bad !  It  Learn from my mistake and avoid like  the plague.

            &nbsp;I bought a HP two weeks ago. I also couldn't connect to my Netgear. It was bought 3yrs ago. Not one person told me my router was not compatible to Windows 8. I finally figured it. I went on Amazon found a new Netgear (only because it was the cheapest).
 This one is windows 8 compatible.&nbsp; I am so glad I read this. Now I know.

<h2>            Desktop loads to Black Screen, Somehow all services are being disabled</h2>
                    


It started a few months ago with me being locked out of all of the security permissions of my files.  I went through and changed them to where I have admin. privlages. Then I shut down the computer one day and didn't turn it on again for about 3 or 4 weeks because I was using my laptop.  Eventually I turned on the PC again and it booted up no problem but it wouldn't shut up for a long time.... i.e. the hard drive stayed busy for about 5 min after turning on.  When I went to shut it down it had the icon notifying me that updates were going to be installed before shutting down. When I booted up the PC the next day it informed me that windows was configuring the updates and not to turn off the computer.  1 thousand 3 hundred and something updates.... WOW!!!   O.K. it updates and it boots up just fine until the next day.... Computer turns on .... loads windows.... Welcome screen.... (Everything is going fine....)   Bam!  No Desktop!!! Just black screen with arrow.  Only way to start program

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You for taking the time to try and help me with this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; No Luck!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried shutting off half of the services, then tried the other half and then tried all.&nbsp; There were a couple of things that I did notice but I'm not sure if it means anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. There were two services names both of them listed with Manufacturer Google Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google Update Service (gupdate)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google Update Service (gupdatem)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Under the General tab there is the&nbsp;normal startup, diagnostic, and the selective startup.&nbsp; No matter what I did it would not allow me to do a diagnostic.&nbsp; As soon as I hit apply one of two things would happen: Program not responding or the selection
 dot would move back to selective startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Known Good Configuration didn't work either.... I had already tried that but did it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again anyways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3:&nbsp; System restore.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this PC from a friend and it has never been able to successfully do a system restore sense I have owned it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system makes restore points but says that, &nbsp;"System restore failed... and nothing has been changed."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the link you gave me for resetting security permissions but It warned me that the article was not for the operating system that I am running so I tried to download the Microsoft Fix It program that it suggested and it downloaded .... lol... (
 I have to laugh at this) but when I tried to run it I received this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're sorry, you do not have the correct permission to run this program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The program dos not support the "run as" feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; To</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolve this problem, log onto Windows as an Admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or as a User who has Admin. level Credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thought I was logged on as Admin. but I went ahead and switched users but I am the only user so I</p>
<p>restarted the computer and tried again and got the same message.&nbsp; Tried to change permissions on it and was denied.&nbsp; Looked into the Credentials part of it and didn't change anything, just looked because I am unfamiliar with it.&nbsp; Here is what it said though...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Credentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; No Windows Credentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certificate-Based Credentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Certificates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generic Credentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtualapp/didlogical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified:&nbsp; Today</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet or Network address:&nbsp; virtualapp/didlogical</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User name:&nbsp; 02ybpqqqlkzo</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: *******</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persistence: Local Machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no change yet.... Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you on this.&nbsp; I appreciate any help you or anyone can give me on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You and hope you have more ideas.</p>

<h2>            Digital Refund</h2>
                    I had accidentally bought 2 digital DLC items on my account that I intended on gifting to someone instead. I can't use these items because I don't even own the game that they belong to. I purchased the items on the 13th, which is only 2 days ago, well
 within the 14 days they request. I also have never used them, obviously, because I can't. They're not installed on my xbox, in case that would be an issue. I requested a refund last night for these two products, only to get a reply this morning saying that
 they were not eligible for refund. I would like to know if I can find the terms that these two purchases violate that make them ineligible for refund, but every support member I've talked to just keep referring me away to the refund page, where I can't seem
 to actually talk to anyone.

<p>Hello Ninjester,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you will need to reply to the email stating you were denied the refund. They are the only ones that handle refunds at this time. Also if you had any previous refunds this could hinder another refund. Also in the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/terms-of-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
terms of sale</a> it states directly:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Some items are not eligible for return; unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular product offer, all purchases of these types of products are final and non-refundable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
digital apps, games, in-app content and subscriptions, music, movies, TV shows, and associated content;</li><li>
gift cards and service/subscription cards (e.g., Skype, Xbox Live, Groove Music Pass);</li><li>
products that have been personalized or customized;</li><li>
special order products, if not part of a Store promotional offering;</li><li>
random access memory ("RAM") products;</li><li>
services that have been performed or consumed; and</li><li>
clearance items or those marked with a designation such as "Final Sale" or "Non-Returnable".<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We recommend replying to the denial email and appeal it through the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    I just got this error recently and since, I have been unable to play music via clicking to play in the app. I can bypass this however by selecting a song in "my computer." When I do this, I am unable to pause, play or do anything inside the app. I must
 close the app to stop the song from playing. Has anyone else been having this problem? YEs, I have installed recent updates and yes I have uninstalled/installed the app.

<h2>            Several programs won&#39;t run or don&#39;t run properly in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Since installing Windows 7 I have been having problems getting the following software to work correctly (or at all).......</p>
<p>Paint - crashes when the file manager dialogue opens (e.g. when you go to save your work - very annoying)</p>
<p>iTunes - won't run at all - double click on the icon, the eggtimer appears for a couple of seconds then nothing (it appears in Task Manager for about ten seconds then vanishes)</p>
<p>Notepad - same symptoms as Paint</p>
<p>Google Desktop - numerous features do not work at all (including Sidebar which says its running but its not)</p>
<p>Epson Scan - driver and scan utility will not install.... rendering my new all-in-one printer partly useless</p>
<p>Fuji Finepix Viewer and camera connection utility - BSOD when I plug the camera into the USB</p>
<p>Tom Tom Home - same symptoms as iTunes but with an error message telling me to re-install (I have several times without success)</p>
<p>WinRAR - will only launch under certain circumstances e.g. it will run if I click "Extract here" but not if I click "Exract to......"</p>
<p>I have completely uninstalled and reloaded all of the above (with the exception of Notepad and Paint), ensured that I am installing the latest version and followed guidance on numerous software specific websites and forums. I have made sure that my PC is
 fully updated and that I have all of the latest drivers. I have also run a basic repair - just to check the file integrity of the Windows system files..... and so far, nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I don't really want to re-install Windows as I see that as an ultimate last resort, I managed to get around all sorts of horrendous problems on XP without ever once re-installing.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that there is something fundamentally wrong with my system, I'm just not sure where to start looking...... any suggestions anyone?</p>

<p>Hello Sntee,</p>
<p>Did you install Windows 7 yourself or was it an OEM version preinstalled on your system?<br />
If you installed yourself, do you have the most current drivers for your hardware?</p>
<p><span>First, let's run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files. (You may have already done this)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p>If the above doesn't help, I would suggest a system repair with an inplace upgrade. It is not a complete reinstall.</p>
<p><span>The In-place Upgrade is a tool to repair the system. Through the special upgrade process, we will be able to repair the system. The In-place Upgrade will not affect
 settings like photos, movies, documents, etc. that are saved on the computer. Though this operation will not remove or modify the installed programs and files, I still suggest you backup the important files before doing this. In addition, you may have to reinstall
 the device drivers after this operation.</span></p>
<p><span>The detail steps are included as below:</span></p>
<p><span>In-place upgrade<br />
====================<br />
1. Log on the system first. <br />
2. Insert the Windows 7 DVD in the computer's DVD drive. <br />
3. Click Start and choose Computer.<br />
4. Find the "setup.exe" file in the DVD-ROM and double click it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Click Install now.</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply back with an update and let us know if this helped to resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sincerely,
</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you are prompted to input the product key, please click Next directly without inputting any key. The setup wizard will prompt and asking if you confirm to install
 Windows Vista without the key and please choose to confirm.</span></p>
<p><span>7. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the system files of Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: While performing the in-place upgrade, the system will restart automatically (Several times) to merge the files and programs, please leave the computer alone and do not configure it until the "in-place upgrade" completed. The system will start Windows
 7 once it is upgraded. Once the computer is performing "in-place upgrade", you can go away and leave the computer and it will complete automatically.</span></p>

<p>Hi Neel,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can protect your Excel file with a password to prevent others from accessing data in your Excel files. In case you forgot the password of the file, you will be needing another third-party app to help you remove the password. You can search
 the web for available password remover app. However, downloading certain apps might present risks to your computer so make sure that you only download apps from a trusted website.
