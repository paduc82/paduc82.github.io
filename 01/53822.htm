    <title>Mic Monitor for new XB1 Headsets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnny eastside  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mic Monitor for new XB1 Headsets</h2>
                    
<p>Does any think that Microsoft will add this function? My headset works fine but the sound in my ears plus the headsets themselves muffling my voice, I feel like I am yelling at everyone. When I used my old X12s, I could hear my own voice (like when you are
 on a old landline phone) so I wouldn't be yelling at everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could see them adding it eventually, if it isn't already in the works. Isn't a problem with me personally. I have been using chat programs on my PC for years with a high quality set of headphones and a podcast mic. So I've gotten use to just speaking normally,
 even though I can't hear myself speak. </p>

<p>I asked the Turtle Beach support about it and all they said was that there is no mic monitoring. They didn't say anything about patching it in later, however in another forum somebody said it is hardware related and can't be patched in. Kinda sucks considering
 they cost so much. </p>

<p>The headset can't be patched but the xb1 and controllers can. The headsets aren't what would provide the mic monitoring in previous headsets. It was the amplifier. The amplifier on they new headsets iare essentially the controller. So it's up to Microsoft
 and not Turtle Beach to fix this issue. </p>

<p>I'm surprised more people aren't complaining about this. I drives me absolutely nuts to not hear myself talking in my headset. I have the TB XO Fours; and they do a really good job at cancelling out sound in the room, myself included.</p>
<p>Also I have a problem with a slight popping in the game sound. I'm getting to where I don't expect anything from Microsoft to work correctly at launch.
</p>
<p>I guess it really is 'a marathon; not a sprint'. Maybe everything will be functioning properly by Christmas this year.</p>

<p>This has been a huge disappointment for an otherwise great product. The Stereo headset seemed like a great purchase until I realized chat was going to be basically ruined by a lack of monitor. I feel bad for those who purchased one from a store who will
 not refund headsets due to health issues. Who would have thought I'd be so happy to go back to my mono headset....</p>

<p>Turtlebeach replied to me : "@Gamezpad The Atlas does not have mic monitor on Xbox One as it uses Microsoft's headset adapter. On 360 and PC there is mic monitor"</p>
<p>I totally agree with other comments on this forum and all are justified </p>
<p>The attitude from Microsoft is so wrong where they basically stick up two fingers to everyone ! We pay enough for quality but we don't necessarily get it.. don't get me started on the xboxone price reduction since launch, I and many others paid £450+ for
 a console that let's be honest was rushed not only OS but specs could of been better.. This gen I have been disappointed so far where's the loyalty from MS ?!?</p>
<p>I also bought the ps4 and find I play on that more with psplus being in my view a big thank you from Sony.
</p>
<p>Anyhow until titanfall comes see u then SUVZ aka @gamezpad</p>

<p>So you are using WEP but connected in G mode is that right? Have you tried experimenting with all of the wireless modes, &nbsp;have you tried just up to 54mbps as a test. Does it connect with no security at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume wired is working fine, can you try that as a test? Also a factory reset of the Xbox network settings is worth doing</p>

            <p>Hi kristinswanson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, you installed the games: Wizard 101, Pirate 101 and WOW (World of Warcraft) on the main profile account. All those games are showing on both child accounts, but the game Minecraft is not showing on any of the child accounts. However,
 are you referring that Minecraft is not showing as blocked game on Family Safety, or Minecraft is not showing on your desktop, thus unable to play it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring that Minecraft is not showing on your desktop, then perhaps it is being blocked by Family Safety. I suggest that you check the Game and Program restriction by following the steps on the link below:</p>

            <p>Hi Francis, </p>
<p>Minecraft, Wiz101, Pirate101 and WoW were all successfully downloaded to our main profile account before we decided to add family safety accounts for the two boys.&nbsp;&nbsp; They remain successfully on the main profile account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i made the new accounts, everything but Minecraft showed up on&nbsp;the kid&nbsp;account profiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if this clarifys anything for you or if my problem will still be solved by going to game restriction?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

            Hi Francis, I looked at "game restriction" link and already had the accounts set up appropriately. &nbsp; so the issue remains that minecraft is on our main profile account but for some reason will not show up on either child account. &nbsp; thanks for helping me
 problem solve this. &nbsp;

<p>Since the game is not blocked under Game Restriction, then we will be needing the log files of your Family Safety. To do so, please refer to the steps below:</p>

<h2>            Nioh 2</h2>
                    <p>Being a huge fan of the From Software games, I have really enjoyed a number of spin-offs in the genre such as The Surge, Lords of the Fallen and Nioh.&nbsp; That said, Nioh 2 looks like it should be spectacular and I was wondering if there was any word on it coming to the X as I believe it would really benefit from all of the extra power the console offers.&nbsp; It would be great to see a port of the first one to the X as well!</p>

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have read what I can online but can't find a solution to my problem. I have an Adesso iMouse E10 and a Logitech K350 wireless keyboard. Both have just stopped working. I have restored my laptop back to 1 May 2016 to no avail. I have tried to get the
 Device Manager to recognise them both. I am at a loss. I don't know what else to do and its so important as I type all the time for my work. Its really hard to use the laptop keyboard and mouse pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kirsty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to connect other wireless devices to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Did you try plugging in a USB keyboard/mouse to check if it works?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Did you try connecting the devices on a different system to check if it works?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the wireless devices do not connect on the system, a suggest you to try running the Hardware and devices troubleshooter to find and fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the Wireless adapter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>
view by </strong>option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>
Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>
</span></span></span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> your computer and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In case the issue persists, try updating the Wireless Adapter from the manufacturer website to check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may install the latest wireless adapter from the manufacturer website which will replace the corrupted network configuration on the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to un-install the drivers:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>On the search bar type “
<strong>Device Manager</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>On the left pane locate “<strong>Wireless Adapter</strong>” and expand by clicking on it</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Right on the “
<strong>Wireless adapter</strong>” option and click “<strong>Uninstall’</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Download the latest Wireless network adapter driver setup file from the manufacturer’s website and install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>

                    Hi <br />
<br />
I have a program (C++, .net) that binds to a socket (rawSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP)); the program works fine on XPSP2, but when running the same on Vista SP1, or W2008 SP2, the call fails with the error 10013 (access denied). Any ideas
 anyone?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>"Brute force" involves a little more than using an admin account. Assuming that you wish to delete the folder "C:\Users\Harry, you can do it like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot the machine.</li><li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Click the Start globe.</li><li>Type&nbsp; <em>cmd.exe</em>&nbsp; in the Search box.</li><li>Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter</li><li>Click "Run as Administrator".</li><li>Type the following commands and press Enter after each:<br />
takeown&nbsp; /f&nbsp; "c:\Users\Harry"&nbsp; /r<br />
cacls /T&nbsp; /g&nbsp; "C:\Users\Harry"<br />
(respond with <em>yes</em>&nbsp; when asked "are you sure?")<br />
rd&nbsp; /s&nbsp; /q&nbsp; "C:\Users\Harry"</li></ol>
<p>The commands are not reversible.</p>

            I had the same problem. &nbsp;Try this: set XP mode to have an its own registration on the network.
<div><br />
<div>• Run the virtual XP, and click the Tools drop down (in the Virtual PC toolbar) and choose Settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Click the Networking section on the left side, then in the Adapter 1 drop down menu, choose your real network adapter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Shared Networking (NAT) prevents the two computers from communicating over the network from what I can tell. &nbsp;I'm not sure why.&nbsp;After I did that, I ran the Network Setup Wizard from within XP:</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;• Control Panel</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Network Connections</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; • &nbsp;Set up a home or small office network &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (bet you sure miss that Start menu search in Windows 7 now...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>After doing that and rebooting the XP virtual machine, I was able to browse over the \\VIRTUALXP-... in my Windows 7 Network list.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>&gt;&gt; Out of&nbsp;curiosity, do you see "TSCLIENT" listed in your Network list (in Windows 7) too?</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            partially installed program will not uninstall</h2>
                    I downloaded a program from Fidelity and was partially installed. Naturally it will not work. &nbsp;I tried to uninstall the program in Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Uninstall and the program, or what remains of it, will not install. I tried downloading it again to
 reinstall it and there was not change. So I restored my PC to a restore date prior to the initial program install and to my surprise, it is still there. Anybody have any suggestions? Do I have to attempt going into the registry to remove the program?

            <p>Close the Window store completely and end the process. You might also have to stop the windows update service and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, boot into safe mode with command prompt and delete it there.</p>

            Yeah, neither of thosr worked for whatever reason... the files were still there after a reboot. Guess I'll just wait for MSFT to release an "official" fix... frustrating.

<h3> armecia  say:</h3>
<h2>            THE LETTERS FADE ON MICROSOFT KEYBOARDS</h2>
                    Why can't Microsoft use lasers to print the letters on their keyboards?&nbsp; Every Microsoft keyboard that I have ever owned has had to be replaced because the letters fade.&nbsp; Using stickers to replace the faded letters do not help because they eventually fall
 off.&nbsp; I will no longer buy a Microsoft keyboard.&nbsp; There are companies who print the letters on&nbsp;their keyboards with laser print and they never fade.&nbsp; When&nbsp;will Microsoft wake up and do the same thing?&nbsp; I use &nbsp;an ergonomic&nbsp;keyboard because I have carpal tunnel
 syndrome and the last keyboard that I purchased (Microsoft) cost $119.00.&nbsp; Microsoft charges enough for their keyboards, why can't they fix this problem?&nbsp; MICROSOFT, ARE YOU LISTENING<strong>?</strong>

<p>Wasn't it microsoft a little while ago who said they wanted console's to become like a personal computer? Hence all the storage options as well as facebook and downloadable music and movies... Who knows the next xbox might have word processing and full internet
 browsing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why they would try and scrap that idea and just offer their system virtually. Seems like millions of dollars on wasted research to me. The guy who wrote this article talking about how playing games on his iphone is better than consoles is hilarious.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Which one do you think is a better buy?<br />
<br />
I've heard mostly good stuff about Lolipop Chainsaw despite how strange it looks, and i'm also a Suda 51 fan. But at the same time I did really like Dead Rising 2. Which is also a considerable amount cheaper as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
Lollipop Chainsaw is a fun game, but there isn't much to it. &nbsp;I completely the entire game in about 3 days, so that's a better rental than purchase.<br />
<br />
Dead Rising:OTR will have more longevity.<br />
<br />
I would veer &nbsp;towards Dead Rising myself.</span></p>

<p>the novelty value of lollipop chainsaw wears off very quickly,luckily its a very short game about 5-10 hours.</p>
<p>its probably a very easy 1000g but i couldn`t be bothered playing it any longer than i did.</p>

<p>[quote user="PlatinumSpectre"]Since you have already played Dead Rising 2 there's not much point in getting Off the Record to be honest.[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)"><strong>Well, that's true to a point, but there is some new stuff in Off the Record.
 If you're a big Dead Rising fan it's definitely worth your time, getting to see the differences between Frank and Chuck in certain situations is interesting, plus there are some story changes and a entirely new area.
</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)"><strong>I played Dead Rising 2 a lot, but when Off the Record came out I played it in Co-Op with a friend and we still had a great time with the new additions. I would only recommend Off the Record if you're a big enough fan of
 Dead Rising for the changes to matter, or haven't played Dead Rising 2. Otherwise I would suggest Lollipop Chainsaw, which is pretty much summed up perfectly by Zen; It's a fun game, although short, it's still a good hack and slash.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I agree with everyone above. For the most part DR2 OTR is DR2 but with some "twist" and a few additional Zombies and Locations. It's story doesn't really make sense in the DR Universe but then again, none of them really did. DR2
 OTR is fun in Coop but mandatory if you're looking for Achievements out it (full 1000/ 1000).
<br />
<br />
For Lollipop, it's actually really good Game-play wise and it can be much more then simple button mashing. The Replay is okay to an extent but after a few times through it, it get's a little old. Rent it or find it cheap.
<br />
<br />
DR2 OTR is already very cheap ($19 new US) so it's definitely easily worth the price of admission for the amount of fun to be had (if you like DR Games). But I still wouldn't discount Lollipop either, find it cheap or at least Rent it for some good fun that
 can give some relief to the everyday shooters. </span></p>

<p>I'm curious about Lollipop Chainsaw, too. I saw it in Game Stop yesterday and I really wanted to check it out, but all I had to go on was a trailer I saw and that doesn't go far these days. I'd rather hear a non-professional review from another player right
 here on the forums. Like, LPC isn't one of those games that tries to over-sell the, what I guess you'd call "sexual content", does it? Don't get me wrong, every lonely basement dweller loves to stare at the exposed, pixelated skin of scantily clad videogame
 characters, but the effect is lost on me in a very short time and I just get bored of it.</p>

<p>LC doesn't over sell it, it parodies it though, there are lots of sight gags and one liners making fun of it. The game is very fun with an awesome soundtrack. It's worth checking out.</p>
