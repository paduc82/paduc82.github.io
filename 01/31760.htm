    <title>Split Track files play as full mix on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Split Track files play as full mix on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with split track files (instruments on the left channel, vocals on the right) which are playing as a full mix stereo (instruments and vocals on both left and right channels) recording on my PC. This is true whether I play them in iTunes,
 Windows Media player, from CD, or a .WAV file on my local storage. This was not the case until recently (I think I accidentally created the problem changing a setting which I cannot seem to find now and change back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the files are split track, as they play as split track on a co-worker's system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the forums and asked Cortana and can't seem to find the setting that would play these properly. Can anyone help?</p>

            Hi Bruce, your Audio may be playing in Mono . . .
<br />
<br />Open the  Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Ease of Access 
<br />
<br />On the left, click Other or Audio, depending on your Windows version.
<br />
<br />On the right, make sure Mono sound is turned off

            Thank you for the suggestion, but "Mono audio" was turned off when I checked. I flipped that switch off and on a couple of times but that's not the source of this problem.

            Hi Brice, do you have any Audio enhancing software like Realtek . ..  etc. 
<br />
<br />Somewhere audio must be set to Mono for the sound from both Left and Right to be coming out of both speakers . . .

<p>I do have Realtek. After your first message, I set Spatial Sound for my Bluetooth headphones to Windows Sonic for Headphones and the files play as split channel on my headphones. The problem now is that the Bluetooth connection with my headphones is terrible.
 I have to hold my head just right and not move or it cuts in and out. I've used these headphones with my phone, my iPad and a Mac in the office and they all work fine together. That is a separate issue, but it is the issue I was seeking a solution for when
 this issue came up. I've been using a different pair of wired earbuds because of this issue. I still don't get split channel on the earbuds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the Bluetooth radio in my PC may be bad (I also have trouble sharing files between my phone and my PC via Bluetooth).</p>

<h2>            Trying to expand disk through command prompt. 29GB available.</h2>
                    <p>So I've had my Dell Inspiron 11 with Windows 10&nbsp;since October 2015. Since then, my hard drive has only had 29 GB of total space available. My computer is supposed to have at least 500GB on it from what I know.
</p>
<p>I've tried to expand my C: Drive through the command prompt as administrator, using the "diskpart" and "list disk" commands and I get a message saying "There is not enough useable space to perform this operation".<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba4f2e5-318e-4f8c-b2ac-978230e6d203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba4f2e5-318e-4f8c-b2ac-978230e6d203" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I send my computer to Dell, I would like help from the professionals online first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>On many Dell systems they set the system up with a small mSATA drive (32 GB) to use as an acceleration drive for the larger HDD.&nbsp; It appears if that was the case with your system you have changed it to make the small mSATA the primary boot drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can't expand partitions across physical drives, if you want to keep that setup you are stuck with that partition size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suppose you have two options.&nbsp; The first might be to get a larger mSATA drive which would allow you to have a larger partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make an image of your current install and image it back to the new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second option would be to go back to the original configuration of the system.&nbsp; Since you are showing the mSATA as GPT you must have a UEFI install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming the mSATA configuration so we need to verify that is actually the case.&nbsp; Can you get a picture of your Disk Management window?</p>

            <p>It looks like my suspicions have been confirmed.&nbsp; If you reconfigured your system you have the two options I mentioned in my prior post.&nbsp; If you did not then Dell messed up your install and you could probably send it back or have them send you media to recover
 the system.&nbsp; You currently do not have the Recovery Image partition with the original factory install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 can be installed cleanly after the system has a electronic activation, you could just reinstall Windows 10 if you wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HDD is also set as Active which is not normal for a UEFI system.&nbsp; That can be changed with Diskpart and remove the active status. since it is only used to boot an MBR system.&nbsp; If you don't have any data on the HDD you could also convert it to GPT which
 would allow it to be used as a boot device for a UEFI install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can physically access the mSATA drive you best option might be to create a backup image and then replace that drive with a larger one.</p>

            <p>What you do depends on what you want to do.&nbsp; But your options are, if you want to increase the size of the C: partition and keep your current install is to image your install&nbsp;and re-image it back to a larger mSATA or to the HDD your currently have.</p>

            <p>Okay, just had this issue and got it figured out.</p>
<p>I did have glyph installed on my pc, so i uninstalled it.</p>
<p>Windows wouldnt update as it said "i still have 'glyph client' installed"</p>
<p>After some searching online and on my pc i found it.</p>
<p>If you have ANY TRION GAME, installed via STEAM, you will need to go into the</p>
<p>steam game folder, for me it was&nbsp; ' C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RIFT '
</p>
<p>and uninstall glyph client, using the 'Uninstall glyph.exe' program.</p>
<p>Not sure why, but steam has to download the glyph client to allow you to play Trion games through steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this provides some help for people.</p>

                    <p>This issue is occurring again.&nbsp; Saw this link and saw no solution for this back then.&nbsp; This was working, up until the last update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/cant-enable-both-lockscreen-slideshow-and/7d9c6d41-7bb6-4eaf-8298-51decb2cc0b7</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate, you can enable the slideshow functionality on the lockscreen and it works fine.&nbsp; But if you enable the screenshow on the slideshow it disables it on the lockscreen.&nbsp; For some reason you can't have screenshow going in both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND this is NOT redundant functionality.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, Asif. This functionality may have been altered or removed with the latest Windows update. With that in mind, it's best that you post this issue on Feedback hub to let the engineers and developers know that this should still be functional.
 Here's how you can post there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for “<strong>Feedback Hub</strong>” in Cortana search, then launch the app.
<br />
2. Navigate to <strong>Feedback </strong>in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.
<br />
3. Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.
<br />
4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking <strong>Begin monitoring</strong> (or
<strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form; <strong>Stop monitoring
</strong>when you’re done. <br />
5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>. <br />
6. Click <strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>. <br />
7. Click <strong>My feedback</strong> at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).
<br />
8. Open the item you submitted, then click <strong>Share</strong>. <br />
9. Click <strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like
<em>https://aka.ms/link&gt;</em>). </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else you need.</p>

<h2>            Spanning the desktop horizontally over multiple monitors.</h2>
                    
<p>I have an nVidia 9500GT video card and Windows 7 Ultimate x64.&nbsp; I recently upgraded from Windows XP Pro and would like my monitors setup the same way.&nbsp; I have not found any way to span the desktop across both monitors in Windows 7 as I could do in XP.&nbsp; I'm
 going to be adding a second 9500GT, and a third monitor, &nbsp;within the next week.&nbsp; I would like to span all 3 monitors &amp; have the ceter monitor as my primary display.&nbsp; I have not yet found a way to do this.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; I have the latest x64 drivers for my
 card (&lt; 1 month old).&nbsp; Can you give me any recommendations?&nbsp; The only options I have are: 1)&nbsp; use 1 monitor, 2) clone 1 monitor onto the other monitor, or 3) dual view.&nbsp; I cannot find an option to span the desktop horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>Hi Davide21</p>
<p>Spanning multiple monitors is no longer available in Windows due to changes in the display driver model. The last version to have this capability was Windows XP. You can still use the Extend function, but this is different from spanning.</p>
<p>Since this was removed, most of the major video card manufacturers have implemented spanning in their software and drivers. ATI Calls it EyeFinity, which is available in most of their latest&nbsp;cards and I believe nVidia calls it SLI or 3D Vision configuration
 which is available in most cards that use their graphic chips.</p>

    <title>Tablet REFUSES to boot from any UEFI-formatted USB drive unless it has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ebm9000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet REFUSES to boot from any UEFI-formatted USB drive unless it has Windows 8 setup&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! I have done numerous tutorials online, none of which have worked. Here is my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install Windows 7 on my tablet (I do have drivers on another USB stick). However, I plug it into the tablet dock and turn it on and go into BIOS, and it is there. But when I try to boot from it, the screen flashes and goes back to the Boot
 tab in BIOS. Using Rufus, I have tried every combination (GPT for UEFI computers, MBR for UEFI computers, etc) and none of them work! To test if the USB was defective, I loaded a Windows 8.1 64-bit setup iso image on the drive, and to my surprise, it booted
 off the drive and launched setup! I just cannot get Windows 7 setup to boot. I tested the stick in my UEFI laptop and it booted just fine! What am I doing wrong? Will this work? probably not, but I am kind of agitated e-e (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Booting from Windows 8.1 setup USB stick, but replacing all other folders on the disk with the Windows 7 setup version so it force installs Windows 7 instead of 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>System Specs: </p>
<p>Intel Atom Z3735F @ 1.33 GHZ (Turbo boost up to 1.83 GHz)</p>
<p>2 GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>32 GB Samsung eEmc Flash storage module</p>
<p>BIOS: Aptio Setup Utility version 2.16.1242</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Interesting thing is that in the BIOS, it says that to enable secure boot (didn't work on or off), CSM needs to be disabled. I am assuming it is, but I cannot find where to turn it back on. American Megatrend's website doesn't let you submit a support ticket
 unless you are in a business :|</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey there Bradley!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your profile up on your 360.
</p>
<p>I would say that if you haven't yet, you might want to go ahead and delete the profile off of the 360, then to redownload if following the steps outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to add or remove an Xbox profile on Xbox 360</a>, as it's best to do this if you ever update your profile info.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know how that helped.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The syntax given by Steve Cochran will work but I would like to add a few comments.</p>
<p>First of all, the wildcard (*.*) is not needed -- the 'dir' command assumes all files &amp; folders so it's sort of redundant in my opinion to type the wildcards.&nbsp; If you choose to do so, it will not hurt anything.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a way to sort the output in alphabetical order; for that the /o switch is needed.&nbsp; I only mention this because, invariably whenever people ask for this kind of stuff they intend to do something with the filenames and it's much easier to
 deal with it if it's sorted. Another switch that I use is '/b'.&nbsp; The /b switch will remove the heading information &amp; summary so that you get just the file names.&nbsp; What I normally do is:</p>
<p><strong>dir "C:\some folder" &gt; output.txt /b /o</strong></p>
<p>Notice that the path for the folder name is wrapped in quotes.&nbsp; You use quotes whenever the folder name or file name has a space in it.&nbsp; You will also notice that there is just a single (&gt;) as opposed to the two (&gt;&gt;) in Steve's answer.&nbsp; The difference is
 that the former will overwrite the contents and the latter will append to the existing file named "output.txt".</p>
<p>Finally, I use the 'Open command window here' shortcut so that I don't have to navigate to the folder/directory that I want to work in.</p>
<p>For example if you wanted to get an output of the following folder, C:\Users\{username}\Pictures\Summer Vacation</p>
<p>Navigate to that folder in Windows Explorer. Hold down the shift key and RIGHT click on Summer Vacation folder.&nbsp; You will see a new option called 'Open command window here'.&nbsp; This way, you don't have to type the full path in your dir command.</p>

            Can you right click it?
<br />If so right click and go to command prompt (admin)
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<p>I'm in the US and when I try to login to SKYPE (not Microsoft). I receive the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You need a parent's permission</p>
<div>
<div>Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to
 try again."</div>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to "account.Microsoft.com" and click on "your info". It shows 1971 for my birthday, which is correct. Thus, I am an adult and not a child. If I look at the above suggestion for , "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>I’m an adult, but my account thinks
 I’m a child"</strong> and try to follow the directions. That does NOT work. Because I don't receive a page that says, "you need your parents permission" because my birthday information is CORRECT in my MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. It is NOT correct in the SKYPE account
 on this particular computer as I do not have any issues whatsoever on my phone or tablet. How can this be resolved.?</span></p>

            I am in Republic of Korea.&nbsp; I set my birth year 201* by mistake when I logged on my Skype account (it has never asked me to reveal my birth year and date before). I want to fix it but whenever I log on to my ms account it keeps asking me to verify that
 I am an adult by using Pin-ID.&nbsp; I heard that using Pin-ID in Korea caused a lot of security problems so I do not really like to use it.&nbsp; Would there be any other way to verify that I am an adult?&nbsp; I do not want to lose all of my contacts on my skype account.<br />

    <title>Payment Options Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roboticcarcass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Payment Options Issue</h2>
                    

<div>
<p>Whenever I try to connect to Xbox Live it says my account has been suspended for something or other to do with billing. A couple months ago I used my grandmother's debit card to renew my Xbox Live for 3 months while it was like 10 dollars or something like
 that. After that 3 months ran out I entered a 12Month pre-paid card, so I thought I should be all good. My grandmother doesn't want her card to be on the account anymore and for some reason I cannot delete it. I shouldn't have to update or add a new payment
 option, because I already payed my money for the 12 Month card that I bought.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The reason your account has been suspended is because you owe money. &nbsp;Odds are you got a billing issue error code. &nbsp;The account probably tried to bill your grandmother's card and was refused. &nbsp;You need to either go to billing.microsoft.com and arrange payment or contact support and ask to speak with billing.</p>
<p>The card cannot be removed while you are still in gold status as it will remove the gold. &nbsp;For this, you will need to contact support and ask them to freeze auto renewal on the card. &nbsp;When your gold has run out, you can remove the card.</p>
<p>Finally all purchasing ability has been frozen until you take care of this. &nbsp;This includes adding codes for content.</p>

<p>Yes, my grandmother contacted the bank and had her bank like block Xbox or something, because I think it did do an auto renewal already and took money out for it. So basically, I have to talk her into calling her bank and unblocking this? Not happening...
 Guess I will just have to wait until I get my debit card -_-</p>
<p>Also, if I remove the card while I'm on gold it will get rid of my gold status, even if I used a pre-paid card?</p>

            At second thoughts I think that Wicked Wisdom confuses "Permissions" with "Restrictions". He probably has a problem with UAC (Universal Access Control). He does not want to remove all permissions but wishes to get rid of all restrictions.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Mail App Crashing</h2>
                    <p>Every now and than I get an e-mail after which my Mail App just won't run. It's just one PC (my tablet pc on win 8.1 has no problem opening the e-mail in Mail App)&nbsp;and I have no idea what message is it. I must presume it's a html e-mail. The only thing I
 was able to get out of the logs is the details below. There is no other error message. I would really appreciate any sort of help. Due to this error the Mail App is completely useless - just won't run :/</p>

            <p>Hi Vijin,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I didn't find any realation betwean the senders domain and the crash.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The settings you are referring to are synced between PCs and the are fine on the other Windows 8.1 PC I use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I referred to the steps from the link You suggested but that (updates ok, firewall ok, admin ok, app licenses synced, app reinstalled) didn't help. The crash still occurs. Though I did find that it occurs only if I go to the account holding the e-mail in
 question.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So if I have a folder pinned on Start screen and go directly to it and that message is not there, the Mail App runs like a kitten. Otherwise, it crashes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If You ask me, there is a certain HTML tag or something similar that causes my mshtml.dll to crash (sometimes it crashes the IE11 too).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So... any ideas? :)</p>

            Don't get me the wrong way but that idea was already in the list of action you sent me earlier so your answer doesn't help as I wrote that I already uninstalled and installed the App and it didn't help.

<h2>            Problem When Upgrading from Windows XP SP2 to SP3</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to upgrade from Windows XP SP2 to SP3, the upgrade program (downloaded from Microsoft) stops because it can't copy the 'oledb32.dll' file. How can I get around this problem? I have tried several tech forums and sites but no one has an answer for
 me. I own a Fujitsu Lifebook laptop computer with Windows XP SP2 Tablet PC Edition 2005.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Lee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Is your system connected to a domain?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nservice.exe seems to belong to IBM Lotus Notes//Domino from IBM.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using any applications like Lotus, then you may try to uninstall and reinstall to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you have the CD or downloaded setup files to reinstall the program.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the articles:
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall
 or change a program</a></span></p>

 program</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If not,
</span><span>you may perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with the troubleshooting.</span></p>
