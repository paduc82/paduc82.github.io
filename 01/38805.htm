            I have been ripping from CD to WAV in &nbsp;Win 10 (OEM full version, not an upgrade) &nbsp; using WMP. &nbsp; Some discs rip perfectly, but a LARGE &nbsp;number just lose Track 1. The first track just &nbsp;disappears. &nbsp;Other discs work, but a large number just don't store Track
 1. It plays, but doesn't show up in File Explorer at the end of the rip. &nbsp; I disabled Auto Play and automatic ripping, but it keeps happening. &nbsp;

            <p>I'm just getting familiar with W10 on a new laptop myself but I haven't experienced this issue as yet. Just to clarify, the reason for disabling autoplay is that there are often problems with the first track if it is actually playing (so showing in blue
 font) as the disc is ripped. To make sure nothing is playing, after the disc has loaded,&nbsp;close then reopen WMP before starting the rip.
</p>
<p>If this is not your issue it seems like it may be a system bug - and there may be a troubleshooter that can be run. I'm still learning myself at this stage so bear with me... I'll investigate. - Cheers, Ric.</p>
<p>ps - I'll also request this element is moved to the Windows 10 forum because there it may be seen by someone who can provide more information.</p>

            Disabling AutoPlay had no effect at all. &nbsp;I tried loading discs and &nbsp;waiting to see the metadata before starting to rip, and still lost about 1/3 of the Track 1 songs. &nbsp;Very frustrating.

            <p>I overlooked the detail that you are ripping in wav. format. Wav files whilst being good for sound quality, are notorious for causing issues with metadata, although why it should always be track 1 in particular is rather strange.</p>
<p>Anyway your problem is now in the W10 forum so hopefully someone more familiar with this may pick it up - I'll try a few experimental wav rips on my Dell to see if I can replicate the problem. - R.</p>

            As also stated in the original thread, using WAV definitely isn't recommended. The WAV format has very poor tagging support: WMP only *tries* to write tags to WAV files once during ripping, and they can't be changed afterwards. For more info, see<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm</a><br />
<br />
I suggest that you rip to a format with better tagging support, like MP3 or (possibly lossless) WMA.

            <p>Yes, I was hoping Tim might pick this up again... I have ripped a few discs using wav. format along with&nbsp;the limited metadata that WMP will add but I have not been able to replicate the specific first track problem unless as I said previously, Tr 1 is actually
 playing while the CD is ripping. </p>
<p>My way around this (not a solution but something you may wish to consider) is that I have a second user account specifically set up for HQ audio files - these will not therefore be in my main account library making it look messy, so the absence of data doesn't
 really bother me. I can still play them from the main account so that once set up it isn't necessary to keep switching users. Regards, Ric.</p>

    <title>Xbox One passkey 100&#37; Bypassable&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hiddenginja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One passkey 100&#37; Bypassable&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>So I spoke to customer support and was told to put it here.</p>
<p>The Xbox one Passkey is not going to protect anything if a hacker gets hold of your account password. The passkey is good for those who don't know your password, but 9/10 if your account gets breached its by someone who illegally acquired your password.</p>
<p>So how does it work? Well, if a hacker gets hold of your password, they can then download your profile. But then they have to know your passkey right?</p>
<p>Wrong... If you enter your passkey wrong multiple times, it simply asks for your password. Which, the hacker already knew, because they have downloaded your account.</p>
<p>I thought this would be important to bring to light as its a false sense of security and as someone who has had their account stolen before, more security measures need to be put in place.</p>
<p>My suggestion is this, if the passkey is entered wrong too many times, simply send out a security code to the account holders phone, just like the chat support do.</p>
<p>This ensures that the account holder knows their account has been breached as they would know whether they have entered it wrong too many times or not.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below, explain to you how connect a PC or Laptop to your wireless network:
<br />
<br />Select the Network or icon in the notification area.
<br />In the list of networks, choose the network that you want to connect to, and then select Connect.
<br />Type the security key (often called the password).
<br />Follow additional instructions if there are any.
<br />
<br />Also, i will provide a link with the procedures:

</p><p>Since you are using the classic version, please try the following steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Open the Skype application and click on Tools</li><li>Go to Options then Audio settings</li><li>Click the dropdown arrow next to the Microphone section and choose your preferred device.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>If you are seeing multiple microphone on the list please try to toggle to each of them and find the one where the green bars next to the Volume are moving</li></ul>
<p>You may need to re-launch your Skype app for changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Hi There</p>
<p>I don't know about helping you since I am having the same issue lately. I have used skype with cam for years. My issue is that there is one contact that I cannot make video contact with through skype. We have tried different solutions the latest being that
 he would upgrade his skype program on his ipad since the version he has is quite old. Will see how that works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to make a video skype to skype call to an ipad which was not a problem until very recently. The message I receive is&nbsp; 'you cannot make a video call to this person'. Am wondering if the problem may be that I have the newest version of skype while
 the person I am calling has a dated version. He is going to delete the old version and re-install the newer one and see if that works. What do you think?</p>

<p>It may have a relevance however we still need to further isolate the case. Can you confirm your exact Skype version please (not latest or recent) and if the issue happens to other contacts as well? If to multiple, approximately how many are affected?

<p>

<p>Thanks for your response. When I go through my contact list there are those with no video but also I have not invited. Others have choice of video when making call. However the 'problem' person in my contact list just shows a telephone and when I try to
 access video the message indicates that he is not available for video calls. I might also add that he is using an ipad to receive calls while I am on Outlook. He is also on an older skype program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype version I am using is&nbsp; 12.9.604.9</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will follow up when he de-installs his skype and reinstalls.</p>

            My camera problem has been solved by <strong>Settings</strong>: to set on the camera for Skype. Because it was off. So you go in
<strong>Windows 10 to settings</strong> there to Icone/button/subject (whatever it will be named)&nbsp;<strong>PRIVACY</strong> (location, camera).&nbsp; There you go to
<strong>Camera </strong>and you get all apps, among Skype, which you can set on or set off for camera.

<h2>            How to set Windows 7 boot loader as default boot loader with Ubuntu</h2>
                    <p>&lt;original title: Automatically boot into Windows&gt;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had<strong> downloaded </strong>the Ubuntu iso from the internet but didn't install it fearing that the<strong> boot loader</strong> will start &amp; ask which OS to boot? I want to boot into Windows 7 automatically after hitting the power button . I had searched
 the whole internet &amp; found nothing useful. As I am a student,&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;I mainly use windows 7</strong> because I have
<strong>Turbo c++ installed </strong>in it &amp; <strong>tc++ didn't support Ubuntu</strong>.&nbsp;Also I use Ubuntu
<strong>occasionally </strong>&nbsp;, so I don't want boot loader to ask which&nbsp;OS to boot.</p>
<p>Also if I need to boot into Ubuntu then how can I open boot loader? But I want
<strong>Windows 7 to start automatically</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs :-</p>
<p>OS : Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit Service Pack 1</p>
<p>Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M 370&nbsp; @ 2.40GHz</p>

            <p>Hello Varun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that, what you are asking is impractical because if Windows 7 is installed over Ubuntu then Windows 7 MBR takes over and it does not display any prompt. It will automatically loads Windows 7 then Ubuntu remains
<span>isolated</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Ubuntu is installed after windows 7 then Ubuntu's GRUP takes over and that will show you a display to choose the desired Operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if you want to modify the Windows boot loader, then refer the steps from the following articles:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/change-the-default-operating-system-for-startup-multiboot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the default operating system for startup (multiboot)</a>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Also applies to Windows 7).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff404185.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Learn Commands for Viewing and Managing Boot Configuration Data on Windows 7</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer the discussion from the Ubuntu websites:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/66070/how-to-set-windows-bootloader-as-default-bootloader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to set Windows boot loader as default boot loader?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/62440/is-it-possible-to-boot-ubuntu-using-the-windows-bootloader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Is it possible to boot Ubuntu using the Windows bootloader?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong><em> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></em></p>

<p>After you performed the scan, you would need to save the document.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then the Printer software will ask you where the document should be saved.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you remember going through these steps?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you should re-scan the document and try the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however, you have done the above and still can't find the document, you could enter the document name in the Search bar and see what comes up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rescanned . On my computer I can only scan to file. I do this and a message comes up on the screen 100% complete. There is no option to add a name to this scan, hence why I cant find it. The other thing I want to do when I find it is attach to an
 email that I have to reply to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Read the documentation that came with your scanner.&nbsp; If you don't have this, please provide the name and specific model of your device and I'll try to find the manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please describe, step by step, how you go about scanning a document.&nbsp; For example, do you initiate the process by pressing a button on the scanner or by starting some software on your computer?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure whether your reply was to the suggestion given by LemP, which is basically hereunder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Drive:\Users\Your Name\Documents\Scanned Documents\Documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you go here, as this would be the default location for scanned documents, unless the user specifies differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The points (#1-7) you've given could be separate areas that you have searched for, as I don't understand "CC4".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your Printer software have an Options menu?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe in there, it could give the location of where scanned files go to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
<p>

<p>I assume that "CC4" is the scanning software installed with your device.&nbsp; It would help if you identified the make and model of the device and the full name of the software product you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, as Chriso747 suggests, look for an "Options" menu (might be "Preferences" or something similar) where the save location will be specified.&nbsp; The "Options" or similar will likely be either on the "File" or "Edit" menus of your scanning software.</p>

<p>4. Used Local &amp; Microsoft Account Logins</p>
<p>5. Other few steps also</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few months earlier also I Loaded Win-8.1 from Win-7 but same problem was there &amp; I shifted to Win-7 again at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;on 2nd April,2014 again I Loaded Win-8 &amp; Upgraded to 8.1&nbsp;&amp; the same problem is there.</p>
<p>

<div><span><span><span><span><span>c) Cl</span></span></span><span><span>ose the elevated command prompt.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span>d) L</span></span></span><span><span>og off, and you will now see the built-in Administrator account log on icon added (enabled) or removed (disabled) from the log on screen.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong></span><span><span>: Click on the Administrator icon to log on to the built-in Administrator account.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong><span><span>To Disable the Hidden Built-In Administrator Account</span></span></strong></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span>a) </span></span></span><span><span>Click “start” and type “cmd” in&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong> to open command prompt.</span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span>b) </span></span></span><span><span>In the command prompt, type “<strong><span>net user administrator /active:no”</span></strong><span> and press<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span>c) </span></span></span><span><span>Close the elevated command prompt.</span></span></span></div>

<div>Follow the step on the page below to start the computer in Safe Mode.</div>

<div><br />
<div>Once you start the computer in Safe Mode the built-in "Administrator" account should show up. I'm not saying that your user account is not an Administrator account but just to be sure use the built-in one for whatever purpose it may serve you.</div>

<h2>            Xbox live gold sharing doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>When I&nbsp;bought xbox live gold for a year, I redeemed it on my own account. I wanted my father and brother to also have Gold. I checked "Home Xbox" so that I could share Gold with them. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. If I play COD Black Ops 3, I can play online with Xbox Live Gold. But my father and brother doesn't have Gold. Does anyone know a solution for this?</p>

<h3> davidmailloux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Error</h2>
                    <p>I currently have already run a scan through command prompt and no errors found there, I literally got a BSOD that stated my netwlv64.sys has failed so after some digging on the internet I found this is 100% a wifi driver issue, not related to anything else.
 I want to know if there's a way to fix this or should I just bite the bullet and buy a new wifi card and save myself the hassle of diagnosing?</p>

            Hi David, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s), to see if they can show any more detail on the cause of the system crashes
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            XP WIndows Explorer does not see CD-ROM media</h2>
                    <p><span>I have encountered a problem with windows explorer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has stopped seeing my DVD drive.<span>&nbsp; Have tried several drives with same results.
</span>If I click on the drive with media inserted, in the explorer window I get a “Insert Disk” message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My disk writer software NTI DVD maker has no trouble seeing the drive and writing to a DVD or CD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Boot-able DVDs have no trouble booting.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I go to Computer Management &gt; Storage &gt; Removable storage &gt; Media , I see the media described in the right hand part of the window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then Explorer lists the information on the media.<span>&nbsp; </span>Changing media may or may not keep working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I have to go back to tweaking (reinserting media or trying to get Computer Management to see device) it to work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have had media read without appearing in Computer Management).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When working the CD-ROM 0 appears in Computer Management &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management.<span>&nbsp;
</span>SP 3, critical patches up to date, the MS fixit tool was run.<span>&nbsp;

                    Hi, I have an acer aspire e 15 start windows 10 laptop. I transferred my pictures and videos from my old phone (lg leon lte) and I went to watch one of the videos that I am sure was definitely a video. I looked around and it turns out that almost every
 video turned into the picture of the thumbnail. I desperately need these videos back so that I can watch them. If anyone can help, I would be so grateful. Thanks.

<p>How did you transfer the files, if you used File Explorer to copy the files across, then it is impossible for Windows to convert the video files into an image file . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you copied the videos across and not just a preview file that sometimes accompanies videos?</p>
<p>For one of the videos, what size it the original file and the copied version of the file<br />

<h3> serenejulie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C&#58;&#92;windows&#92;system32&#92;config&#92;systemprofile&#92;Desktop&#92;music. Error&#58;&#40;The system cannot find the path specified. &#40;0x80070003&#41;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had to uninstall iTunes a few months ago, and successfully re-installed it, but some of my music was missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point, following instructions on some thread on the Apple or Microsoft forums, I saved my music library to the desktop. Since then,
 I don't have a music library file on the desktop.&nbsp; In my looooooong hours of trying to fix things, I don't know if I deleted it or what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I get the message:</p>
<p>"Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop\music. Error:(The system cannot find the path specified. (0x8007003))" whenever I back up my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand, this doesn't really affect any other files, they are backed up (I think), but
</p>
<p>HOW DO I GET RID OF THIS MESSAGE? or whatever is causing it?&nbsp; I sure could use some help in plain English, step by step, as I am not very techie...</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS!!!!</p>
<p>Trying to be...</p>

            <p><span>Hello Serene, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the error suggests, this problem appears, when these folders/libraries which are being backed up automatically&nbsp;are not present on your computer. I would suggest you to follow the steps given below and check, if this helps to fix the issue.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Create the missing folders that are listed in the error message. </li><li>Exclude the folders from the files to back up in the Backup settings, and then include those folders in their original location. To exclude the folders in the additional locations and to include those folders in the original location, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, open <strong>Backup and Restore</strong>. </li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Backup</strong> section, click <strong>Change settings</strong>.
</li><li>In the <strong>Set up backup</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Next</strong>.
</li><li>In the <strong>What do you want to back up</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Let me choose</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Expand <strong>Data Files</strong>, expand <strong><em>&lt;your user name&gt;</em> Libraries</strong>, expand
<strong>Additional Locations</strong>, and then click to clear the <strong>AppData folder</strong>,
<strong>Contacts</strong>, and <strong>Searches</strong> check boxes. </li><li>Expand <strong>Computer</strong>, expand the item for your system drive (for example, expand
<strong>Local Disk (C:)</strong>), expand <strong>Users</strong>, expand&nbsp;<strong><em>&lt;your user name&gt;</em></strong>, and then click to select the
<strong>AppData</strong>, <strong>Contacts</strong>, and <strong>Searches</strong> check boxes if they exist.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>, and then click <strong>Save settings and exit</strong>.
</li><li><span>In Backup and Restore, click <strong>Back up now</strong> to perform a new backup. The backup operation should complete without errors.
</span></li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to follow the steps provided for troubleshooting backup problems in the following article.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows backup or restore errors 0x80070001, 0x81000037, or 0x80070003</span></strong></p>
