            Hi  broomeinwelly 
<br />
<br />I would wait at least 7 hours to see if it progresses, upgrades can take a long time, especially on Tablets.
<br />
<br />If it rollbacks I recommend you try performing the upgrade using the ISO, its more reliable. 
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

<br />
<br />Upgrading manually:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:

<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.

If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

<h2>            Bluetooth not appearing</h2>
                    <p>I'm running windows 10 on my PC, and on my main profile, blue tooth doesn't appear anywhere, not device manager, not settings. Nowhere. However, when I created a new profile as a test, bluetooth showed up in the settings, and I was able to enable it there.
 Does anyone know how I would be able to somehow enable bluetooth on my main profile?</p>

            <p>The fact some services are present doesn't really mean anything.&nbsp; You need the actual device do be able to install a driver, which you already know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the link below with does have info on the device not showing up in Device Manager.&nbsp; They are suggesting a bad driver might be the problem.&nbsp; If you have a Device in Device Manager which is showing as not working or Unknown we need to get that working
 since it might be the Bluetooth.&nbsp; If you don't you can get Device Manager to scan the system for devices to see if that finds it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that has no effect you might try uninstalling any Bluetooth software you show in the Program and Features area and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An again, I suggest disabling the device in the Bios, if you can.&nbsp; We have known for quite a while to repair something in Windows you may need to do it three times.&nbsp; Rebooting three times with the Bluetooth adapter disabled might allow the system to forget
 about it so it can reset.</p>

<h2>            need to run Windows Network Diagnostic to connect to Ethernet&#47;Router</h2>
                    
<p>We are using Windows 7x64 Ultimate in our office floor. Most are Dell, HP and Acer and others. All use Ethernet network cards connected to always on Cisco Linksys Broadband routers, ie, WRT54G and other models.</p>
<p>Often, after we boot, the computers will directly connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>However, many times, the computers do NOT connect to the internet. We have to bring up the Network and Sharing Center, then, click the red "X" mark to run the Windows Network Diagnostics. The dialog box will indicate "Windows tested your Internet connections
 and verified that you are able to access some websites. Are you looking for help with a different issue?" Then, the red "X" mark disappeared, and this computer is connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>What can we do to make the connection to Internet automatic every time we boot up?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Since this issue occurs in few computers, it is not a single computer problem but rather an overall Network issue which is beyond the scope of this forum.</p>
<p>If the floor is a part of a business network that have someone in charge of it, or an IT department, you should seek their help.</p>

    <title>Windows doesn&#39;t assign drive letter automatically - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows doesn&#39;t assign drive letter automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Till tomorrow my 2TB WD elements Drive having single partition works fine. Automatically detection of drive and drive letter was assigned automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today I am facing some strange issues regarding this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After plug-in the drive, disk management shows it. But Windows doesn't assign drive letter automatically.<br />
<br />
2. At this stage, in Disk Management, Properties window of the drive ( from right-click context menu) is not showing up.<br />
<br />
3. Using 'Change drive letter and path..' I can/have to assign a drive letter (example the drive letter is J:). But after ejection of the drive using 'Safely remove hardware and eject media' form taskbar and re-plug in the drive, that drive letter (J:) is not
 seemed to be reassigned to this drive any more. In explorer double-clicking the drive (J:) shows the 'Location not available' issue. I have to use another drive letter for the same drive<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cccc0f80-52f5-4a5d-96e6-0ad103c1f040?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cccc0f80-52f5-4a5d-96e6-0ad103c1f040?upload=true" /></a>4.
 Disk Clean-up button is missing in Drive properties windows in File Explorer. Clicking on 'Check' from 'Error checking' group of 'Tools' tab of Properties window doesn't open up 'Error checking option'.<br />
<br />
5. This drive is unfornately missing fron Recycle Bin Location in Recycle Bin Properties.<br />
<br />
6. After deleting a file from this drive, explorer doesn't show 'Undo Delete' in context menu. God knows the file goes where? And the 'Recycle Bin' is also missing in explorer window after exploring the drive. (Show Hidden file.... is checked and Hide protected
 operating system files is unchecked.)<br />
<br />
7. CHKDSK with /f doesnot return any issue.<br />
<br />
8. The Disk Drive has Master Boot Record(MBR) as in 'Disk Information' group in 'Volumes' tab in Disk Drive Properties from Device Manager. But TestDisk automatically selects 'EFI GPT' (in Hint it shows: EFI GPT Partition table type has been detected) not 'INTEL'
 after selecting the disk.<br />
<br />
9. I have tried to clear hidden attribute( I guess it may exists) of the partition form Diskpart. Here's the Diskpart Results to worry about:<br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; automount<br />
<br />
Automatic mounting of new volumes enabled.<br />
<br />

<br />
DISKPART&gt; attributes volume clear hidden<br />
<br />
DiskPart has encountered an error: Incorrect function.<br />
See the System Event Log for more information.<br />
<br />
From Event Viewer Error Event Data: 1@01010015</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>Now I want this drive working well without format or any kind of data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you give some light in this issue? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>One more things Windows is blocking the letters which I assign by manual method. Means I have assigned the letter 'I" now, After restart PC, the letter 'I' is not available to reuse. Explorer shows
 the 'I" drive icon but opening the drive, pops up 'Location is not available. I've to choose the next letter 'J" and later 'K' .... and so on...

    <title>Saving downloaded movies onto a flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giantoctopus69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving downloaded movies onto a flash drive</h2>
                    Hi. For the first time I downloaded a movie I purchased from the Microsoft store. It seems like I can only watch it online (under "My Films and TV"). Is there a way I can save it on to a flash drive and watch it on another device devoid of Internet connection?
 I already paid for the movie.

            Wait a minute. So by purchasing a movie (it cost me $20!) I can only watch it on my PC logged into Microsoft? I can't save it onto a DVD-Rom and watch it on my DVD player? That doens't make sense. That's like buying a DVD at Walmart but you can only watch
 it when you're at Walmart.<br />

                    Since today my Skype for business icon is flashing every couple of seconds. I'm not able to determine the reason. But it is not the "Tag for status change". All of our contacts have this disabled. I have checked my **** client settings. None of these seem
 to make a difference.

<p>
</p><p>While anniversary 1607 wasn't a problem for either my desktop or laptop&nbsp; the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176495) certainly IS a problem.</p>
<p>When applied I get the blue screens and failing apps that seem to be happening with others on 1607.</p>
<p>My Laptop is a very high end clevo (i7, 16GB ram, Hybrid SSD, R9 290 gfx)</p>
<p>MY Desktop is a beast with an i7, 16GB RAM, R9 390X, Asus Z97 Sabertooh MK 2 and boots from an SanDisk Ultra II SSD.</p>
<p>Both run Win 10 pro and both get this same issue.</p>
<p>it seems in windows 10 you have to download an app to hide updates</p>
<p>"To temporarily prevent the driver from being reinstalled until a new driver fix is available, a troubleshooter is available that provides a user interface to hide and show Windows updates and drivers for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
The following troubleshooter is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
<br />
<br />

 "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter package now.</a><br />
<br />
Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was posted. The file is stored on security-enhanced servers that help prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.<br />
<br />
When you click the download link, you're prompted to open or save <span>wushowhide.diagcab</span>. "</p>
<p>This used to be built into windows but apparently not any more!<br />
So i have phoned microsoft support.......... yeah... epic fail.</p>
<p>I had.. two people hang up on me (one from India and one from America) because I had to keep correcting them.. not this makes me sound like a horrible person but when you have explained clearly and concisely to someone what the issue is and then they turn
 round and ask you "now on your windows phone...".. seriously.......</p>
<p>However after actually letting them remotely connect to my machine and do some ... to be honest absolute rubbish that has killed my kinect for PC.. even with reinstalling and removing and replacing the registery edit for using the kinect as a webcam(worked
 an absolute TREAT will MS support killed it...</p>
<p>however I was told i'd get a call back guaranteed between midday and 2pm the very next day.</p>
<p>they didn't call and now i am left with a machine that is now incapable of working with my kinect(yes i have the official kinect pc adapter.. yes the kinect still works on the xbox one)..... that is incapable of running for ore than 30-40&nbsp; minutes without
 a blue screen..</p>
<p>Thus basically MS support has left me with a machine in a worse state than when i let them to connect to my machine and bugger it right up!</p>
<p>Tell me.. does MS support have people that actually LISTEN to their paying customers and have the knowledge to diagnose a problem and fix it rather than totally bork something that worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Whatever it put in that cumulative update unleashed the gremlins 16097 did in a vast amount of users.... and for it to be claimed it's a "few users" is disingenuous at best.......</p>
<p>So Microsoft... who do i complain to and which one of you is going to fix the complete mess your colleagues have made of my machine?</p>
<p>BTW.. all they had to do was give me the info on how to stop the update.. i would have been happy to gie log files, happy to send anything you needed to diagnose this ... but nah.... your support staff utter ineptness has caused MORE problems than i had
 before....</p>
<p>Not a happy camper in Scotland i can tell you!</p>
<p>EDIT.. Just on a whim I looked at services in Admin tools.........</p>
<p>why on earth had Kinect Monitor and Kinect Management be disabled????</p>
<p>I certainly didn't and seeing as how it was installed with windows hello and the skype camera in mind i would hardly turn them off!!! This i am gonna go through those services and switch on the ones i know i need to be running.</p>

            <p>I have been trying for a day to install Win10, but 1607 has bricked my computer so badly that it will not come close to installing Win10. &nbsp;I have valid Win10 DVD from computer mfg and a new valid Win10 on USB purchased directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I even added a new standalone SSD and Win10 ignores it.</p>
<p>I have tried the many Internet command lines.</p>
<p>I have tried the Win Media trouble shooting and advanced repairs several times and ways.</p>
<p>I have to get back working and at noon tomorrow I will draw the line and take the hit of an almost $3,000 6-month old computer built with Win10 as being a loss due to 1607 and will order any Win7 system I can find.</p>

<h2>            Terrible Service</h2>
                    
<p>I am commenting on the Xbox One my son purchased on day 1.&nbsp; Since then, he has been able to use the system for a total of about two weeks.&nbsp; Shortly after purchasing, he began to have issues where the system would shut down unexpectedly.&nbsp; After dealing with
 this for some time, we contacted service.&nbsp; I suspected a faulty power supply and the service tech agreed.&nbsp; He informed me he would send packaging so that I could return it.&nbsp; When the packaging arrived, it was for the console, with instructions to return the
 console only.&nbsp; We did so, and when we received the replacement console, it wasn't long before the problem re-occurred.&nbsp; This time, however, the system filled the house with the odor of burnt electronics.&nbsp; When we contacted service again, I had to spend two
 hours on the phone, with service again just wanting to replace the console.&nbsp; When they agreed to replace the power supply, they told be I had to pay for shipping the power supply back.&nbsp; The reasoning, the power supply is an accessory.&nbsp; Since when is a component
 that is required for a product to function an accessory!&nbsp; I protested to no avail.&nbsp; When I asked to speak with a supervisor, the supervisor was rude and disrespecful and provided no path for further escalation.&nbsp; I left the call disappionted and angry but it
 was clear that was not any consern to the service agent.&nbsp; I did have a service order for returning the power supply but before doing so, I decided to give the online chat with service a try.&nbsp; Again they argued that the power supply was an accessory, and they
 were not responsible for shipping.&nbsp; I then decided that this deserved a complaint to the state attorney general and stated this in my chat.&nbsp; The agent immediately replied that they would send a shipping label.&nbsp; The lable never arrived.&nbsp; So, rude, disrespectful,
 and now a lie. My son&nbsp;is out $400 for this thing so I bit the bullet and payed the shipping.&nbsp; When I went online to check status, the order came up candelled.&nbsp; I contacted support and they couldn't tell me why, when, or if I would receive a replacement. &nbsp;I
 am so angry with Microsoft that I actually did some investigation into class action law suits.&nbsp; What is remarkable, is that Microsoft has so little confidence in the release of this product that they actually try to indemnify themselves against class action
 lawsuits in their terms of use agreement.&nbsp; I wonder how well that will hold up in court when a vast number of those agreeing to their terms are minors.&nbsp; If you are someone who has had a similar experience respond to this post.&nbsp; Maybe we can get something going.</p>

<p>No doubt about it, MS sucks. This is similar to my experience with the Xbox 360. Promises, lies, rude behavior. Nothing has changed. I went to my state's attorney general during my 360 fiasco but to no avail. MS doesn't care. I have two of these Xbox Ones
 (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment) and they seem to be working worse today then when I first purchased them. The Kinect seems less responsive and there are still some pages that require you to use the remote! WHAT THE F?! So there's no actual point anymore
 in having the Kinect since you're going to have to use the damn remote anyway. Kinect used to understand commands pretty well, too. But after 4 months it seems to understand less and less. Good luck.</p>

<p>yes there going to be refurbished thats how it has been and will be for years , i sent my busted one in and they sent me some one elses that they fixed and in a week they will be giving my fixed one to some one . &nbsp;Also xbox has the best customer support
 outa of any gaming company from nintendo to sony or steam they are amazing and fast i am on my 3rd they all had busted disk drives so disks would not play , anyway they sent me a ups tracker and i just bought a $2 box &nbsp;to ship it and i had this one sent and
 back in my hands in under 3 days and that was from the other side of the country but the great thing was this consoles warranty was expired by 2 months and they still replaced it no problem . Now i do think as a owner of every console since the atari 2600
 that this console has had issues and the interface is broken every day from leaderboards to achivments not unlocking and horrible install times plus the store is the worst i have ever seen and that they charge tax on digital games so that $20 game is $25 in
 my area but on my other console (compititon) no tax so the game is $20 thats why most games get bought for that console because it is cheaper., but i am gratefull that they cover the warranty well after it expired .</p>

<p>I've been gaming since the C64 days and have owned every console in the PS and Xbox series since their respective entrances to the console market.. I've personally been lucky and have only had a launch PS2 die on me within the first week after launch.. got
 lucky and could exchange it for on that had been neglected as a preorder..</p>
<p>Because of my good luck I've not had to ship any og my consoles in for repairs... but in the event I would need to do so I could have wished for the option to request that I could wait for them to repair my console and send the dame unit back to me! I do
 not belive refurb units are unique to MS/Xbox.. and for many who would rather not wait possibly a good solution, In the store I work at the suppliers of the cash registers/it systems work it much the same way as MS with the differance beeing that they will
 come collect a defective component/part and leave/install an other refurbed one that had been in use somwhere else and repaired after a failure, pretty much tha same deal as wihj ms with the difference that they them selves will come around an sort it.. most
 often they work well enogh, but can often look like it has been dragged kicking an screaming to a certain hot place and back..</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing I don't like with refurbs in general is that I know how I treat what I've owned from new, but you really never can tell how a refurb unit of any kind had been treated by the previous owner/user even if it looks one is lucky an it looks good
 on the outside.. and I guess not allways that easy for the one doing the repairs either</p>

<p>My One has barely been used, and I was 8 or 9 days past their warranty window. So I have to pay to repair my P.O.S. One. It's given me nothing but trouble since Day One, so I'm having even more trouble wanting to repair it.

<p>Disc drive recognition and grinding sounds. Both issues with mine. </p>

<p>Can't agree more. The Customer Service from Microsoft is atrocious. I had an Xbox One for a little over a month, I had nothing but issues with it. So I figured I'd contact Customer Service. Not a single reply to over 4 posts, was on hold with a hotline for
 over 4 hours, and as one would think, absolutely nothing was done about any of my issues. I have to honestly say, if it wasn't for my hatred for Apple products,I would never partake in any Microsoft product again. No way in hell am I ever supporting a company
 that doesn't care about their customers at all whatever the product. The Xbox One was the most disappointing console I have ever owned. Out of the 16 that I own. Biggest waste of $500 I've ever committed.</p>

<p>I am lost i have never been on hold for more than 15 min and as i said two months after the warranty expired and they still fixed it , first dont be a grouch be polite and you would be surprised as i was kind and at first i was told i had to pay then i explained
 politly how i have been a member since day 1 of the original xbox and i went through 10 broken 360 consoles that they were through them and after are talk she was kind and covered me . But all this stuff about being on hold for hours is hard to belive and
 saying you were on hold for 4 hours is very wierd if that is the true length . Try dealing with steam or PS those are way worse at least here you can talk to people and a few options and always contact them by phone dont expect amazing help through chat .
 It is obvious you are a child or just never dealt with a game company because microsoft has a good reputation for customer service and they do compared to the other companies in gaming field &nbsp;, but the x1 does have issues as i have posted many times from the
 interface to the store were my other consoles are perfect compared to this mess on the x1 but the service is outstanding .</p>

    <title>Back up in Windows 10 versus Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john0919  say:</h3>
<h2>            Back up in Windows 10 versus Windows 7</h2>
                    In Windows 7, I used a weekly backup scheme and it rarely required more than one 4.7GB DVD, and it would incrementally backup each week for several weeks before asking for a new disk.&nbsp; My first backup in Windows 10 required five (5) of the 4.7GB Disks.&nbsp;
 My question is, what is the big difference?&nbsp; I am dreading the next backup, because what took maybe 15 minutes before in Windows 7 took hours in Windows 10.&nbsp; Is there something I can do to reduce the number of disks and the time.&nbsp; I noticed also that the OneDrive
 eats up a lot of resource and I usually have to suspend the process to get any speed out of the machine.&nbsp; Could OneDrive be my problem with the Backup Utility also??

                    I have an acer laptop with windows 10. &nbsp;I'm using the laptop touchpad. &nbsp;I want to turn off the scroll wheel function entirely. &nbsp;How do I do this? &nbsp;I tried contacting microsoft help and they sent me instructions that involve going to a "touchpad" tab that
 I don't have when I go to the mouse options.

            You need a micro USB to full USB&nbsp;&nbsp;digiland tablet comes with this, you will also&nbsp;need a&nbsp;USB hub, USB keyboard, mouse&nbsp;and win 8 home recovery USB media tool, then when you restart the tablet I think f7 or f12 boot to the USB windows media tool. Then either
 repair or reinstall windows. I have used this&nbsp;install windows 10 but then needed to install drivers after install on digilands website

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the microUSB to full FEMALE USB adapter, and the other stuff buckshot37 mentioned, you will most likely need to convert a Win 8 or 8.1 ISO to a specific type of USB Flash Drive that will boot into UEFI Bios... if this is what you have...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a tool called RUFUS to make the Flash Drive... and at least a 4GB Flash...</p>
<p>8GB might be a safer bet...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>RUFUS needs to be set to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select your Flash Drive</p>
<p>GPT for UEFI...</p>
<p>FAT32...</p>
<p>And then you will click the&nbsp;box for "Create a Bootable Disk Using" and select&nbsp;ISO from the menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to watch closely when making your selections... You may need to go through them several times... Sometimes the options reverts to a default when you choose the next option and you need to go back and reset them correctly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... If you have saved an image of your internal drive using the Windows Image feature, you can reload it with the installation media... One of the options is to Recover an Image... But the Image needs to be a proper
<strong>WindowsImageBackup</strong> file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just click on REPAIR instead of INSTALL when that window comes up... Then click on Troubleshoot... Advanced... when the repair options appear..</p>

    <title>Blocking the possibility of online purchase for XBOX LIVE GOLD and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blocking the possibility of online purchase for XBOX LIVE GOLD and XBOX GAME PASS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Ruslan and I am an owner and constant user of XBox One S.</p>
<p>I leave in Ukraine, but because XBox doesn't have an option to register accounts from Ukraine I chose Russia, beccause of the language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working ok, but a while ago I received a msg that Microsoft canceled the possibility of online subscriptions purchase for accounts from Russia. The recomendation says that I need to apply to reseller to purchase Xbox Live Gold and XBox Game Pass.
 But we don't have representative of XBox in Ukraine. And actually before buying consol I was hesitating between PS4 and XBox. Stopped my choise on XBox because it has XBox Game Pass and EA Access. But now there is constant problem to renew my subscriptions.
 Pls advice the steps to solve this problem. I am not from Russia and I want to use all options of my concol</p>

            Hello! as the message states you'll have to buy it somewhere else than the xbox store. There's nothing else you can do. Probably some rules in Russia changed and this affects everyone that has the xbox set to that region.

            Yes, off course. The possibility of online purchase is inactive. I would prefer to state my real place and to use Ukrainian language instead of russian, but the list of countries for account registration is very short. Maybe I should register account in
 other region? UK or USA wold be ok for me because of English language

            Hi AdamAnthony1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you are able to use translator properly in Skype?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />This would help me to isolate whether Skype client is the reason or is there a problem with Skype services.

<h2>            5Ghz Wifi has a white x on it</h2>
                    <p>So recently i accidentally changed some of my wireless network adapter settings and now my 5ghz wifi has a white x on it and every time i connect to it, it disables my wifi and i have to restart my computer to connect to the normal 2ghz wifi. I've tried

<h2>            Permenatly block windows 10 update virus.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely fed up with windows 10 constantly trying to shut down my computer and install new virus material.. NOTE:</p>

<p>By definition 2 these so called updates are viruses! (The fact that by defulat windows even tries to "update" computers close to it is even more alarming!!) I do not mind the odd patch to correct faulty software but windows is trying to update several times
 a week. The very best result of this is that my PC will fall in a heap after 3 years. I do not believe in any way that these so called updates are beneficial, i am stringent in my use of antivirus software and put my faith in this to protect my computer NOT
 Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run all the current trips and tricks to prevent these updates, but they still continue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are Microsoft is unable to offer a solution to prevent this continued abuse and hacking of my computer. They should post details of how I can revert to a previous version of windows, or how I can get a refund for this "product".</p>

            How to go back to a previous version:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />If you are unable to do it from the desktop
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Block the Windows Update Assistant:
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Type "Task Scheduler" in the search bar next to the windows icon in the lower left corner. A window will pop up. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2. On the left hand side, click Task Scheduler Library&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;UpdateOrchestrator. Once you click on "UpdateOrchestrator", you will see a list become populated in the center upper portion of the window.
<br />
<br />3. What you want to do at this point is DISABLE "UpdateAssistant" and "UpdateAssistantCalendarRun". Voila. Windows 10 Update Assistant will be dead forever and you are free to use your perfectly working as-is PC indefinitely without interruptions.

<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.
