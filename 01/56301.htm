    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - CRITICAL ERROR persists, Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - CRITICAL ERROR persists, Internet Explorer unavailable</h2>
                    Disappointed that "Microsoft Community" has left me hanging the past 24 hours. There was one reply with two suggestions, and after I replied neither solved the problem, there's been silence. Microsoft didn't clearly state my computer would be hobbled with
 their upgrade. - Per before, my Start Menu isn't working, which kicks out a message "CRITICAL ERROR - Your Start Menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you log in." This box continuously runs me through the process of logging me out with no
 resolution. Now my INTERNET EXPLORER is unavailable; the icon is missing from bottom bar apparently randomly. Made GOOGLE CHROME my default browser because the new explorer triggered repeated warnings from Norton Security software. - I am not an IT person
 and this is a very disturbing situation Microsoft has created with very limited help after hobbling my computer.

            <p>I feel your pain, my friend. The exact same thing happened to me two weeks ago when I upgraded from a perfectly well-functionning Windows 7 to this horrible mess that is Windows 10.<br />
<br />
You are simply wasting your time if you are trying to troubleshoot the problem, and even risk of making things worse. I have tried countless so-called solutions suggested here and there on the net and wasted many stressful hours, to no avail. I believe there
 is nothing you can do but to wait for the "geniuses" at Microsoft to fix the mess they created, or to re-install Windows 7 or 8 from a back-up drive (if you have one), or clean-install Windows 7 or 8 from a Recovery CD, or clean-install Windows 10 from the
 ISO file downloadable from the Windows website. For me, these actions are of a last resort and I am very reluctant to proceed as I have several users, programs, files and documents loaded on my desktop, which means a re-installation from scratch would likely
 take me a very long time to accomplish, notwithstanding any complications along the way.<br />
<br />
For your reference and help you vent along with me, I started posted several rants in the Microsoft Forum and elsewhere on the net when my computer got damaged by Microsoft:</p>
<p>"SHAME ON YOU, MICROSOFT:<br />
There are hundreds if not thousands of worldwide posts already on the internet complaining about that major issue, that is the Critical Error-Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in" (which of course doesn't work,
 what a joke!).<br />
I have tried countless of so-called "solutions" found here and there on the net, including some suggested by your "brilliant" software engineers (who I suspect very well know the troubleshooting won't fix anything, which is quite insulting as far as I'm concerned),
 wasting hours and hours trying to figure out how to fix your mess, or even trying to revert back to Windows 7, all to no avail.<br />
Man, I had a perfectly fine working Windows 7 before installing this piece of garbage. No wonder it's free!<br />
MICROSOFT, you owe it to your customers to have your I.T. SWAT team work around the clock to come up with a fix ASAP via an update that automatically installs without having the end-user perform some complicated computational cyber-gymnastics to repair your
 useless catastrophic non-operating system.<br />
You also owe it to your customers to keep us posted about development via press releases so we know what's going on and when exactly can we expect to get our computers back to normal. Anything less would show contempt and arrogance and will guarantee you a
 PR nightmare, you can be certain of that. Simply hiding behind some vague casual statements from a brain-washed spokesperson is not enough, such as this gem from last week:<br />
"Microsoft has acknowledged the issue and Jen, who works for Microsoft, stated that they are looking into the matter and that a fix is on the way. We've fixed many of the underlying causes for this issue, but there are still some eluding us, and I'm sorry to
 hear that this is impacting you guys" (no kidding, Jen!)."We have telemetry and crash reports that we're watching for this."<br />
Thanks for the update, Jen from Microsoft. So, Jen, any news since then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(That was early August. Here is a recent update:</p>
<p>http://news.softpedia.com/news/microsoft-confirms-start-menu-and-cortana-critical-error-in-windows-10-provides-fix-489786.shtml</p>
<p>Trust me, the Safe Mode booting then normal booting suggested will not work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed: An incredibly frustrated and angry customer"</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
What I am hoping also is that someone, somewhere starts alerting the medias about this, TV, newspapers, social networks, etc...spread the word (whoever wants to use my rant is more than welcome to do so) in order to shame and embarrass Microsoft in public.
 What these incompetents have done, releasing a defective operating system, is inexcusable, and they deserve massive public shame. I also suggest that when Microsoft finally releases a permanent fix, if ever, that you open the settings (you can't now as you
 need the Start Menu to work in order to do that) and that you change the following in order to stop greedy Microsoft from spying and selling data on you:</p>

    <title>No explorer.exe file&#33; Can it be replaced&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guitarace  say:</h3>
<h2>            No explorer.exe file&#33; Can it be replaced&#63;</h2>
                    Here's whats going on: I updated my Windows Vista and restarted as per the update's prompting. Upon restart I get to the point where the desktop should come up but I just have a black screen and a mouse. I thought maybe explorer just didn't start for some
 reason so I tried to run it from the task manager. When I tried to run it I got a message back that the Program Explorer.exe doesn't exist. I'm assuming something went wrong with the update or maybe I had a virus that was corrupting that file, but either way
 the only way I'm able to use my computer right now is through the task manager. So my question to the community: Is there a way to fix this without reinstalling Windows as I purchased my computer through my school and for some reason they didn't come with
 discs? I'm kind of hoping it would be as easy as someone emailing me a copy of their Vista Explorer file. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try launching explorer.exe from C:\windows\system32 folder?</span></p>
<p><span>This happens if a windows file is corrupted or if it is infected by virus.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: If you are able to access the registry editor, I suggest that you verify if the value for the windows shell is set to default:</span></p>
<p><span>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify
 the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore
 the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-SG/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-SG/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</a>

<p><span>Hi Nattoush,</span></p>
<p><span>• Where have you saved the pictures?</span></p>
<p><span>• Is it in the local hard drive or external drive or network drive?</span></p>
<p><span>• Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to run check disk to scan the computer for error.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow this step to do the same:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start and in start Search, type CMD</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right click on CMD and select' Run as Administrator'</span></p>
<p><span>c. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk<span>&nbsp;</span>/r X:( drive letter)</span></p>
<p><span>d. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Close all applications, and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: While performing check disk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if
 any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally you may refer the following link for more information:</span></p>

    <title>Unable to Install .NetFramework 3.5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Install .NetFramework 3.5</h2>
                    <p>Good Day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your help guys, I have a Laptop that has Windows 8 on it., It has<strong> .NetFramework 3.5</strong> before but I need to Reset it since Its running Slow and I want to Erase all of the files that is on there. After the Reset I re-installed all of
 my apps but I encounter problems now in Installing the&nbsp;.NetFramework 3.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing it in 2 Ways</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st in Control Panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05383936-41c2-4bd8-adca-7260819680c8" /></p>
<p>2nd In Admin-CMD using the DISM Command and My Installation Disk (Windows 8)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e52afe48-bb2c-4b62-b467-8c3abf4aee79" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant find any solutions for Error Code: <strong>0x800f081f </strong>I even contacting Microsoft but they just wanted me to pay $49 first before they help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet connection is not actually a problem since I do have internet and even installing it using the Offline method is useless since it will give me same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to resolve this? This was my first time encountering this problem since I never experienced it in
<strong>Windows 7</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>installed all updates</strong> I even purchased a New Product key to upgrade my Windows from 8.1 to 8.1 PRO but I had no luck. I wish one of you can provide a solution to my dilemma right now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I checked the updates installed and it seems like all updates were installed successfully including those updates that you mentioned</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27ea8c2d-9b91-4403-a570-d9400e2b44d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And about the installation source, I'm using the original Windows Media (Windows 8 DVD) in installing it through CMD and I'm pretty sure that my PC doesn't have any restrictions. I even tried copying the installation files in a local hard disk and specified
 the sources there but still the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And about Installing it through Control Panel it says that it requires Internet Connection and I have one but as far as the error message on the screen on the previous screenshot it says "Please Make Sure You're connected to the Internet" and I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also sure that my windows is not corrupt since I just re-installed (Fresh Install) it when I replaced my hard drive last June 14, 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I don't understand cause I'm pretty sure that I did everything right as far as installing the Windows and It's Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that I can do to resolve this?</p>

<p><strong>Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443.aspx</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on demand or enabling it in Control Panel fails, you may get one of the following error messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x800f0906:&nbsp; “Windows couldn't connect to the Internet to download necessary files. Make sure that you're connected to the Internet, and click Retry to try again.”</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x800F081F:&nbsp; “The changes could not be completed. Please reboot your computer and try again.”</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These messages may be displayed for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your computer is not connected to the Internet. Please connect, and then retry the operation.</p>
<p>If you cannot connect to the Internet, you can enable the .NET Framework 3.5 by using the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool and specifying the installation media (ISO image or DVD) you installed Windows 8 from.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012, open a Command Prompt window with administrative credentials (that is, choose
<span>Run as administrator</span>).</p>
</li><li>
<p>To install the .NET Framework 3.5 from installation media located in the D:\sources\sxs directory, use the following command:
</p>
<p><span>DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:d:\sources\sxs</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>/Online</span> targets the operating system you're running (instead of an offline Windows image).</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>/Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3</span> specifies that you want to enable the .NET Framework 3.5.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>/All</span> enables all parent features of the .NET Framework 3.5.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>/LimitAccess</span> prevents DISM from contacting Windows Update.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>/Source</span> specifies the location of the files needed to restore the feature (in this example, the D:\sources\sxs directory).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For more information about DISM parameters and options, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=259118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Enable or Disable Windows Features</a> </p>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<p>You are using a local source, but the network location is inaccessible or doesn’t have the right content. Install the .NET Framework 3.5 from installation media as described in the previous bullet point.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Your administrator has configured your computer to use Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) instead of Windows Update for servicing. Ask your administrator to enable the policy to use Windows Update instead of WSUS.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If these instructions do not correct the problem, download the paper <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=256570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I tried it in several ways, my Internet Connection at home is ADSL and I also have Mobile Broadband (LTE) but both of them is giving me the error:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I even tried asking a friend of mine that has cable connection and also tried going to a public wifi zones but still I had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and as far as Internet Browsing is concerned IE11 is working perfectly fine but I normally use chrome to browse the web but bottom line my computer is connected to the internet. I can even install Updates from Microsoft and for my other apps.</p>

<h2>            logon failure&#58; unknown user name or bad password. Windows 7 machine trying to connect to Vista </h2>
                    
<p>I have bought a W7 PC and am trying to log on to other PCs on the network. I can connect to one, can't connect to the other but can see them both&nbsp;in the network and sharing centre/view network computers and devices. When I try to log into the non-connecting
 device, the system automatically changes the user ID - I'm on ADMIN, trying to connect to GUEST - it changes my sign in from GUEST to ADMIN_PC\GUEST.</p>
<p>I connect to the LAN from the W7 machine wirelessly. The Vista machine I can log onto is connected via ethernet link to the router. The machine I can see but cannot log into is&nbsp;connected to a switch via ethernet&nbsp;and then connected via ethernet to the router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having read discussion boards, it looks like this problem can be fixed by making changes to&nbsp;Local Security Policy - Network security: LAN Manager authentication level but I cannot find where to do this.</p>
<p>I am at the end of my thether - I believed the hype and thought that W7 would be easy to use. What do I have to do to get this thing to work?</p>

            <span>You don't need to change anything with LAN Manager. The problem is probably related to Item C below. Here are general network troubleshooting steps. Not everything may be applicable to your situation, so just take the bits that
 are. It may look daunting, but if you follow the steps at the links and suggestions below systematically and calmly, you will have no difficulty in setting up your sharing.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the
 built-in Windows Firewall and a third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7, go to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Network and Sharing Center. Click on "Change advanced sharing settings". You don't want to use Homegroup unless you have all Windows 7 machines. If you do and you want to use Homegroup, see Windows 7's
 Help &amp; Support. Otherwise, in the Advanced Sharing:<br />
<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> network discovery<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> file and printer sharing<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> sharing in the Public folder sharing section<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> password protected sharing<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, turning on Window's File and Printer Sharing as above will take care of this for you. In XP you can run the Network Setup Wizard or just
 enable File/Printer Sharing in the Windows XP Firewall's exceptions. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With third-party firewalls,&nbsp;I usually configure the
 LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure its firewall. Do not run more than one
 firewall. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.</span>
<br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.<br />
<br />
C. Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and match on all machines.
<br />
Start&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

<br />
</span><span><br />
D. If one or more of the computers on your network is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).<br />
<br />
E. Create shares as desired. In Windows 7 I usually share out the user's Desktop and the Public directory.<br />

            <p>You can maybe try going into device manager and looking at the battery section. If it has a warning sign (! mark) then click on it and it may sort you out. Or click on the battery then right click on an option about the battery itself and click on update
 driver software. You may have to do something different to this but the thing you should try is updating the driver for it as this may be out of date after upgrading from your previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, windows will automatically search for the latest drivers online. If it doesn't find any you can try looking on the manufacturers website.</p>

            <p>Hi again, </p>
<p>Sorry it didn't work. Everything there looks fine to me. My one other suggestion would be to refresh the PC. In the update and recovery section of settings go to the reset section. There should be an option to refresh the pc. This keeps all your files and
 apps but is used to try and fix any issues. You won't lose anything and it may fix your issue as it is used when your PC isn't running too well. Afterwards you will have to install all the updates you had previously&nbsp;and may have to change one or two settings
 as they are sometimes reset in the process. However, nothing will be lost and it has certainly fixed issues for me in the past so should do for you.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> bw587  say:</h3>
<h2>            SAL.xls.exe virus and resulting damage </h2>
                    I have been infected with sal.xls.exe virus and have removed it with AVG - latest version.<br />
<br />
My hard disk and removable disks have a $recycle.bin and System Volume Information folder on them that is hidden and unaccessable.<br />
<br />
I have stopped system restore and tried to delete folders. I can remove the $recycle.bin folder but not the system volume information folder. The $recycle.bin reappears.<br />
<br />
How do I remove them?<br />
<br />
I have run:<br />
1. AVG Anti virus Free V9<br />
2. AdAware Free V9 anti Spy and AntiRootkit<br />
3 cCleaner V2.28.1091 (Latest)<br />
4. AML Free Registery cleaner<br />
5. HiJack this<br />
<br />
I need to delete the $Recycle.bin and System Volume Information folders to clean up the disk and stop the virus reappearing.<br />
<br />
In regedit I have set the values for Hidden files to 1 so I can see the folders but I can not delete them.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&lt;!-- google_ad_section_end --&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am running a HP Pavilion DV7 Notebook PC with a Intel Core i7 CPU Q820 1.73 GHz and 4 GB Ram<br />
<br />
<br />
Need help as my system is slowing down. Any ideas please.<br />
<br />
If I can get into the system volume Information folder I can delete the malicious files. However I can see the folder in Explorer but I can't access the folder. Is there a way to get into the folder. There must be a setting somewhere to grant access.&lt;!-- google_ad_section_end

<p>Thanks for your reply! &nbsp;As is often the case when 2 parties are involved, it becomes a circular exercise with fingers pointing in both directions. &nbsp;However, I was able to uncover the issue and find a resolution. &nbsp;In frustration, I set up a test folder at
 the destination and directed the backup profile to it, and it worked. &nbsp;The solution was to delete the existing destination back up folder and create new ones. &nbsp;The back up task is running fine with no further errors.</p>

<h2>            Scammed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday I was involved in an incident where I got scammed out of a hefty amount of money. This person spoke with me via skype and I still have thier user or whatever in my contacts. I'm not sure if this his username but is it at all possible to provide
 his information so I can report? Should I call and tell the police? Or is that some sort of privacy thing? Is there any way I can catch this guy with the little information I have?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e154bd8-b82f-403b-987f-00014580ed5c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e154bd8-b82f-403b-987f-00014580ed5c?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi SalmaAgerbi 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Try removing the mouse from device manager and rebooting to see if it will install properly.
<br />To do that right click your start button and select device manager.
<br />Then go to your mouse and right click and select uninstall device and then reboot.
<br />
<br />Also have you tried another USB mouse to see if the issue persists?

            Hi Dr. Joe.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See the fix here to correct problems caused by a new Version 1709 feature:
<br /><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/stop-auto-reopen-programs-restart-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/stop-auto-reo...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi Apsy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see issues with photos taken in portrait mode on the iPhone 4 models that do not auto-rotate pictures when imported to a Windows 7 PC. This is the case when you physically import them via USB or when you explicitly set the Windows Live Photo Gallery import
 tool to: Rotate photos during import.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to&nbsp;edit pictures from iPhones, we suggest that you import all pictures taken from an iPhone to a windows PC and open the files using Windows Office Picture Manager, which is part of the Microsoft Office Suite. Other 3rd party tools will do
 as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the files and export (or&nbsp;use the <strong>Save as</strong> option)&nbsp;the photos in a bulk process or individually depending what tool you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>It's a great game if you like randomized maps and stats. While the repetitive gameplay and paper-thin plot prevented me from playing it more that I could have, I still enjoyed it while it lasted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;you know you can add all kinds of effects on your gear right? i have two axes that do over 1000 damage and have 30 effects on them. just go to a enchanter or find a shrine and upgrade your gear. the only thing bad about that is the more you enchant the
 higher the chance of a disenchant and if that happens just go back to the dashboard and reload your game. just be sure to save befor you enchant.</p>

<p>I loved Dungeon Siege II years ago, so I love this...I feel like I should have started on the hard setting now(even though I've come close to not healing quick enough). I have 200 red and 150 blue potion(as a mage). I think I broke the game, I've had the
 same equipment for a long long time. I just switch the stones and enchant my weapon. I'm getting bored dominating it, so I think I'll put a new set together.

<p>
</p><p>I'm able to load Windows for 30s-1min before the BSOD hits and I'm shut out, so I can't really do much in standard mode. &nbsp;I've gotten into Safe Mode without any problems, and have pulled my MSINFO32 data, comp specs, and my last 3 dump logs, which I've uploaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwRuPBIq2Ou1OGpoVGhHbjJmT0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwRuPBIq2Ou1OGpoVGhHbjJmT0E">here</a>.</p>
