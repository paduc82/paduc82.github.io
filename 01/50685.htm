<h2>            Windows XP endlessly reboots&#59; won&#39;t boot in Safe Mode and Last Known Configuration doesn&#39;t work either</h2>

<p>
Hello! I recently installed&nbsp;<a href="http://wubi-installer.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wubi</a>, and am
 enjoying it well. However, a few days ago, when I tried to boot XP on my netbook (an EEE PC 1005hab), it just endlessly reboots back to the OS selection screen. I have tried Safe Mode and Last Good Known Configuration with no avail. What should I do now? Ubuntu
 has&nbsp;<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1127823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">stopped working
 suddenly</a>, so I can't access my data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;have a Windows XP CD, there is some weird Asus recovery thing instead. Also, this is a netbook so I don't have an
 optical drive to run recovery CDs on. I'm trying to make a USB Linux Livecd so I can backup my data... but is there anything I can do but reinstall at this point?</p>
<p>
Thanks.</p>

<p>Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (even an external one).<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</p>
<p>If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then choose it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.<br />
<br />
Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

<p>My friend and I are both stuck in game chat when in a party together. We both tried hosting the party with the same result. I have open NAT and I'm pretty sure he does too. When I press "Switch to party chat" nothing happens. Very frustrating.</p>

    <title>Problems buying skype credit, and with customer support chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewshafe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems buying skype credit, and with customer support chat</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ever since my skype updated to the new version and UI (which was very frustrating to say the least), I have not been able to purchase Skype credit.&nbsp; If I try to purchase it via the Windows desktop program, it says "unable to process your order."&nbsp; If I log
 into my Skype account on the web and try to purchase it that way, I get the error "Unfortunately, we were unable to process your payment. Please try again by choosing a different payment method"</p>
<p>This worked perfectly until the automatic skype upgrade.&nbsp; I'm down to my last few cents of credit and need to make some very important calls from overseas.</p>
<p>I tried connecting to chat with customer support, and was presented with a Captcha, which i filled in.&nbsp; Then it pops up what I presume will be the chat window, but presents a second Captcha.&nbsp; This one refuses to accept whatever I type in.&nbsp; First, it's not
 clear from the scrambled text which are upper or lowercase letters, but if I keep asking for a new one I can eventually get one that is clearly just uppercase with numbers--easy to put in, but again refused.&nbsp; It says what I typed was incorrect.&nbsp; I must have
 tried this 30 times to no avail.&nbsp; So this is my last effort to get help or I will be forced to find some other program to use.&nbsp; What a pity.&nbsp; Skype was so easy and helpful and now it's a nightmare.&nbsp; Is there a way to roll back to the old program?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>PS The Skype subtopics to post under on this forum are not appropriate--I only got a choice of calling, getting started and messaging.&nbsp; So I chose calling, and then my only option for Subject was audio and video.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I hope someone sees this.</p>

<p>Interesting.&nbsp; Immediately after installing 1701 yesterday, my AMD system (8-core FX) code 10'd on the PCE-AC68 and I cannot get it back.&nbsp; In device manager, all the information about the card drivers is correct.&nbsp; The Oct 2017 drivers won't install using
 the ASUS utility, and neither the 2016 nor 2015 drivers work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind of sad, because prior to this update the card produced reliable fast connections to my access point over 200 ft away through three walls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post the system characteristics as soon as I get back to it; obviously, one can't do research on a machine with no network connection to the outside world.</p>

<p>In the end, I moved the PCE-AC68 to a Fedora-based linux box and bought a new PCE-AC88 for my Windows box.&nbsp; It installed properly and is working.&nbsp; So my repurposed PCE-AC68 is working fine, and my new PCE-AC88 is also working fine.&nbsp; I realize that's not
 a valid solution for everyone, but for those of us who have to have our systems functional immediately, that one will work.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's nice about Linux is that once hardware is supported, it seems to be supported forever without undue breakage -- a philosophy
 sadly lacking from Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft might take a page from IBM's backward - compatibility philosophy, and assure that once hardware works under Windows, Windows won't break that hardware.&nbsp; That's why IBM implemented the 7090 microcode in S360 -- they
 allowed their customers to run really ancient operating systems and business software on modern hardware without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes to those plagued with this problem.</p>

<p>Hi people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get my AC68 "fixed" by rolling back the Windows 10 update (I also rolled back my NVIDIA graphic driver to a month old version as my Oculus experienced issues with the HDMI port on this Windows 10 Creator's Update as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this from Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Recovery following some of the steps of this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-use-the-rollback-function-in-windows-10/3e9e5c2d-239f-488c-9f48-64a226302657</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully it was a lot easier than I thought, the roll back feature was very simple to perform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm on the older Win10 now, but that's fine.</p>

<br />	You just have to connect the microphone, and then in the search box of the taskbar, type Speech Recognition and select Windows Speech Recognition.
<br />
<br />	When you complete the wizard, you can follow a tutorial to get information about voice commands and train the PC to recognize your voice. Get information on more voice commands in Windows Speech Recognition.

            Thanks for your help on this. I have the same problem as Sergio. When I select "Start Speech Recognition" with my headset connected I get a message saying the wizard can't start and asking me to check the sound set up. I can hear sounds but the microphone
 doesn't seem to be recognised. I use the headset at work using Dragon and it is fine but Windows doesn't seem to recognise the microphone. I have checked in Control panel/sounds and the headset is there. Any help would be much appreciated.

 it. The headset is an MPOW make.

<h2>            Replace instead of merge folders&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>When you copy a folder to somewhere that has a folder of the same name, Windows 7 asks if you want to merge the two folders. Is there any way to replace the existing folder with the folder you are copying?</p>
<p>The only way I can think to do this at the moment is to delete the existing folder and then copy in the new folder, which is rather long-winded and is a change from WinXP.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Hi tngjstn 
<br />
<br />That just indicates that you could save 10GB if you were to compress your drive!
<br />
<br />Honestly, unless you are seriously running out of space, it is best not to compress your data, doing that would have a performance hit, because every file you open would need to be decompressed each time and re-compressed when closing

<h2>            My Free movies&#64;hd app not showing up in my ready to install</h2>
                    <p>ok so I had this app on my Xbox called free movies @hd. Basically you could watch tons of movies and shows for free. So I tried to load it up and it wouldn't work. I tried restarting my Xbox 5 times and it wouldn't load up or if it did load up the movies wouldn't play. So I uninstalled the&nbsp; app&nbsp;thinking i could just go into my ready&nbsp;to install section in my games and apps and reinstall it. Well i went there and the app wasn't there. I looked all over couldnt find it. so i looked for it in the store and it wasnt there either. i really liked. that app and i would like to get it back if i could. so if anyone knows anything please &nbsp;let me know. Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>had the same problem but decided to replace it with another app: Free Movies for Xbox~ search movies if you don't see it in the menu, even though a site change is needed if there's a play error - must be traffic overload and you need to find a site with less traffic </p>

<h2>            USB ports sometimes unusable in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Dell Windows 7 desktop. It has 7 Hi-speed USB ports. Two of them are use for the mouse and the printer (both work fine). So I have a Logitech Quickcam that I tried to plug in all the ports, and only one is&nbsp;usable&nbsp;with the webcam (the other the
 computer just show the driver was&nbsp;unsuccessfully&nbsp;installed, which I already did). Next I plug in a SanDisk USB flash drive that work fine on the other computer. The computer recognize it but doesn't let me open what's inside the flash drive. Sometimes it work
 great. I don't know why is this happen, is it relate to the driver or something?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for asking this question in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
As I understand you are not able to use some of the ports for the computer. I will try my best you help you get the issue resolved, however if the issue is with the ports itself you may have to contact the computer manufacturer.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Have you tried connecting the device on the ports which you know is working fine?</li><li>Has all the ports worked prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you aware of any changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<br />
As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so re installation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:<br />
Disconnect all the USB device before the steps.<br />
<br />
<b>NOTE</b>: Do not uninstall the USB controllers for mouse and keyboard<br />
Uninstall and reinstall USB controllers.<br />
<br />
a. Click on “start” and then type “<b>devmgmt.msc</b>” in the start search box and press “enter”.<br />
b. Expand USB controllers.<br />
c. Right click on USB controllers one after the other and click on “Uninstall”.<br />
d. Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
You can also download the latest driver for your chipset from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.<br />
f you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using Windows update.
<p>Refer the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 to have been changed, maybe after the end of support for windows xp.</span><br />
<span>Now I understand that Microsoft ended support but then supplied a patch for the above problem, but if I can't get the patch on then it all seems a bit of a waste.

<h2>            Icon says no internet access but I can access the internet, I cannot however, access networked printers or anything like that.</h2>
                    Tray icon says no internet access and shows yellow exclamation point. I do have internet and and can browse the web. I cannot connect to networked printers though... I am the only one with this issue at my workplace and it is very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Sometimes disabling and re-enabling my network card in device manager fixes it for a short while but sometimes it doesn't....<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the computer connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message when you try to access network printers?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods provided below if the computer is not connected to a domain.</p>

<b>‘Uninstall’</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Re-install the latest network drivers from the Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer the following link to update the drivers.</p>
<p><b><span>‘Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly’</span></b></p>

            Thank you for your suggestions. The problem was solved by updating the nVidia drivers. The PC now runs quicker and its performance has improved. Now if there was a solution for the BD-ROM.

            <p>Hello Sharif, In response to your post the printer being used is brand new and updated. IE9 is in medium for the internet zone rather than the medium-high (default) setting. The web page still produces an error message when trying to print. If the Enable
 Protected Mode check box is unchecked, then the page is printed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for running as an administrator, that has also not worked.</p>

<p>I searched for a solution for you and unfortunately this is the only thing I could turn up with, its from a YouTube video in which the person has experienced this issue and has done the following with his disc. The solution below is from the YouTube video</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*FIX* The issue is nothing to do with the console unless it is making a brutal skipping sound upon entering the disk. The real problem is the disk. The BluRay CD that the manufacturer sold you has corrupt files and the only way to fix it is to return and get a new disk OR return it and buy the digital copy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope you find a better solution or the previous solution works!</p>
<p>All the best - East :)</p>

            <p>It could also be updates interfering with the install. &nbsp;Before you return the disc for an exchange try taking your console offline (either via settings if wireless or by unplugging your ethernet cable) and then install the game to see if that helps.</p>

            <p>Actually, I found the MUCH NEEDED solution for a lot of guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Geolocation Service in "services.msc" is disabled/or corrupted.Microsoft has actually accepted this glitch and given us solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can eliminate this glitch by deleting the regkey in regedit.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>FOLLOW THE SOLUTION PROVIDED IN BELOW LINK...<br />
</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn764773.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the folder "3" location was back on and everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS VERY COMMON PROBLEM FACED BY ALL WINDOWS 10 USERS AND THERE ARE MANY THREADS REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THE RESPONSE BY MICROSOFT GUYS WAS PATHETIC. THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE ABLE TO RELATE THE PROBLEM TO GEOLOCATION SERVICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enabling Geolocation service in "services.msc" is not easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to turn it to automatic the message was THE SYSTEM CANNOT FIND THE FILE SPECIFIED. &nbsp;So if you delete this regkey i.e., folder 3 ..then we can enable this geolocation service to automatic and then EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL......finally
