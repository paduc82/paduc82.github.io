                    <p>Based on the other postings I've seen, I&nbsp;am not optimistic about reaching a resolution.&nbsp; That said, has anyone else experienced something similar to the situation I describe below, and if so, were you able to resolve?&nbsp; </p><p><br /></p><p>I&nbsp;received an email from Microsoft notifying me of an Xbox Live Enforcement Action. </p><p>Logging onto https://enforcement.xbox.com,&nbsp;I learned that my son had Xbox Live privileges revoked for 28 hours from the enforcement date-time indicated for a "Communication" violation. There were no specifics of the violation noted, only a generic listing of what <em>might </em>have been reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the short duration one-day ban, even logged on as myself, I had no opportunity to request a Case Review to understand specifically what my son was being accused of.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I question the legitimacy of the reported violation.&nbsp; When asking him about it, he stated he had not&nbsp;done anything like&nbsp;what had been l

<p>Refreshing your computer removes all programs not downloaded from the Windows Store. Although personal files will not be affected, I strongly suggest backing up your files before you do the refresh because why take chances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Settings app</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select <strong>Update and Security</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. On the left-hand side of your screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. On the right, click Refresh your PC and then follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work for you, try the restart method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On the login screen, click the <strong>Power </strong>icon, hold down the shift key, then click
<strong>Restart</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You will see a light blue screen with some options. Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>
<strong>&gt; Advanced Options &gt; Refresh this PC</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are explanations of the options available to you in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options in Windows 10 - Windows Help</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refresh was a Windows 8 facility.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>There is information about it in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC - Windows help</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>To find out if it applies [in practice] to Windows 10, you could search this forum &amp;
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update-winpc/how-do-i-refresh-my-computer-in-windows-10/www.tenforums.com">
TenForums</a> but your search will be hampered by the fact that many people write
<em>Refresh </em>when they mean <em>Reset </em>[<em>Reset </em>does apply to Windows 10].&nbsp;
</li><li>In your search, I would urge you not to trust advice from "Microsoft" posters, such as "Microsoft" forum moderators,&nbsp;because they are notorious in this forum for posting rubbish.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>One useful repair method that the Recovery options page does not mention is a&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair install</a></em> [also known as an
<em>In-Place upgrade</em>].&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>No applications are lost by running a Repair install.&nbsp; </li><li>Repair installs can cure a host of different Windows problems.</li><li>A Repair install involves use of a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 installation disk</a> but&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not a re-installation.</li><li>During&nbsp;a Repair install, your computer will overwrite many Windows system files with those from the installation disk.&nbsp;
</li><li>A Repair install does not reset the Registry which is why you do not have to reinstall applications afterwards.</li><li>A Repair install does not generally have any effect on user account problems.&nbsp;</li><li>Some Windows settings might be&nbsp;reset to default values by&nbsp;a Repair install [in the same way that
<em>Windows update</em> can change them] so you do need to check them afterwards.</li><li>Some customised Registry entries can be reset by a Repair install so if you have used RegEdit to customise your computer you will need to check those entries afterwards.</li><li>You should always run Windows update after a Repair install in case it&nbsp;has overwritten updates that you had previously installed.</li><li>In addition to its use as a repair method, you can also use a Repair install to update Windows to a new version.&nbsp; So, for example, rather than allow Windows update to update my computers to Ver 1703, I created a Ver 1703 installation disk using the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media creation tool</a> and then used that to run Repair installs.</li></ul>

    <title>Copying large &#62;1.5GB files problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gadgetmadman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying large &#62;1.5GB files problem</h2>
                    I have a reasonably powerful system (7.4 Win7 Exeperience index) and recently added a USB3 external dock (icybox)&nbsp; I wanted to benchmark copying times but was dismayed to see that a largish file would initially copy at breakneck speed (&gt;1GBps from SSD
 to external SSD) after about 50%-75% (variable) the copying basically stopped and the displayed copying speed just kept getting lower and time to complete higher.&nbsp; When I try to cancel, nothing happens at all and trying to get rid of the dialoge boxes&nbsp;eventually
 causes Explorer to crash.&nbsp; Researching the forums gave a couple of suggestions - one to do with BCDedit and the other with auto-tune but neither of the suggestions has made any difference.&nbsp; I haven't tried this with smaller files yet but I think that the break
 point is somewhere in excess of 1GB. <br />
Maybe a related problem but when copyng a large number of file - windows explorer progress bar displays complete (full green) well before all the files have copied and I have no way of knowing at what point I am in the copying process - this is a particularly
 frustrating problem and seems like a fault in Windows 7 - or could it be the addition of USB3 (ratifyed in 2008 evidently and support built into Windows 7 I understand??)

            I've managed to find the solution myself and you will be glad to know that it has nothing to do with Windows 7.&nbsp; I didn't run a utility called Sanitary Erase after updating the Firmware (although there was nothing to indicate that this was necessary!)
 I have done so now and all my problems have gone - I can copy a 12Gb file at 92MBps internally and 88GBps externally to my USB3 dock.&nbsp; I have also&nbsp;no longer suffer&nbsp;the "Logging Off" problem as Windows shuts down perfectly now!

I've noticed that everyone I know that has the pre-order copy is doing just fine after 1.03 Patch update and everyone I know that bought it used or otherwise without the pre-order code has their map broken in-game. My guess is that content is locked in the
 map that you cannot access without unlocking certain missions and or areas which in somehow locked the map for certain users. This definitely isn't happening to everyone. But, those it does, seriously affects gameplay and basically hinders ability to progress
 without serious difficulty. It seems to be happening on all gaming platforms, so it is the game and the update. I've tried picking up scraps, using balloons, triggering cut scenes, and completing objectives, deleting and reinstalling the game and patches.
 Nothing works. I'm sure that the developers are cracking down on this, but I thought I would leave some insight on my end.

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).<br />

<div>It occurs only when I'm playing a game (League of Legends) and I'm not sure how to fix it. I am able to get through some games without any BSoD but most games will BSoD anywhere from 10-30 mins of playing.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You could always uninstall Norton/Symantec as a test or permanently. Uninstall it
<br />
and run the Norton Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants from being <br />
left behind. Below are recommendations to use.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp; - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Norton Removal Tool and the others)<br />
<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Avast 7.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free - small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or<br />
use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

    <title>Circle over Network icon in taskbar prevents programs from running on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Circle over Network icon in taskbar prevents programs from running on startup.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Circle over Network prevents programs from running.</p>
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>On Windows 7 for the last couple of weeks i have been having some start-up issues. Upon booting the screen appears normal, all icons loaded. The only difference to look at is a cirlce over the square network symbol in the bottom right of the taskbar. This
 circle stays there for 10-15 mins and during that time i can't load IE, Outlook, Word etc, but can load solitaire and a couple of other basic programs.</p>
<p>Trend Micro have been over it many times remotely for over 3 hrs and can't find anything. Would anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>you don't specify how you are connecting?</p>
<p>This appears to me to be a connection problem.</p>
<p>If wired and using a cable modem&gt; unplug the modem and wait a good 10-15 seconds before plugging back in, this will recycle the modem &gt; also reboot your computer system.</p>
<p>If using a modem and a router, unplug both of &nbsp;them as stated above, wait good 10 -15 seconds before plugging back in and reboot your computer systems.</p>
<p>If this does not help, and you are using a wireless connection, It could be you are not recieving a strong enough signal.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Lancon,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Adding to IC3QU33N suggestion, you may follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may perform clean boot and then check if the issue persists. It will start Windows7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and
 helps to eliminate software conflicts. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following
 the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also manually download and install the network adapter drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have tried updates as you suggested but the problem remains. I don't think it is a connection problem at all as having, or not having a connection would not stop me from loading IE or Outlook or Itunes or any other program it would just tell me there's
 no connection available.</p>
<p>I am getting really annoyed that i have to wait 20 mins or more to use my computer every day, especially considering it has never done this before.</p>
<p>Any other ideas...?</p>
<p>Thanks for the support</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for replying.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may uninstall the network adapter drivers completely from device manager. Then try installing the latest drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In device manager, expand the network drivers listed in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on the network driver &gt; click Uninstall &gt; Put a check in “Delete all driver files”.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Try installing the latest network adapter drivers.</span></p>

<p>Hello again Debleen,</p>
<p>I tried as you suggested and it made a difference only once. When I had to restart the computer for the changes to take effect it started normally as it used to do... but every time since then it has gone back to having the gray circle for 20 mins. I can't
 even start the Device Manager or Control Panel during the grey circle of death.</p>
<p>I'm getting close to madness here. This is my work computer and i work from home as a Marketing Manager so i need this thing to be working normally again... any other ideas??</p>
<p>:(</p>

            A DVD stores the video in files VTS_01_n.vob (where n is a number). Copy the<br />

            <p>My wife's&nbsp;lumia 930 was upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10. Initially she had a similar problem&nbsp; - the download and install for the update that would enable the English (Australian) speech and keyboard would stall. But eventually it did download and install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my 1520 I thought that &nbsp;other processes might be inhibiting the download and install so I turned off the Bluetooth connections to my&nbsp;MS band and car and retried but the problem persisted.</p>

            I can't get Hey Cortana to activate either. I get the same error of display language and keyboard not matching. Frankly, I dont care as I'm sure Hey Cortana would be a real battery hog. Long press on the search button to access Cortana works just fine
 for me.

            <p>Kym,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What printer do you have?&nbsp; Brand and model number?&nbsp; The setting you want to use is a feature of your printer software.&nbsp; When you open the Control Panel, then click on Devices &amp; Printers, you see your printer listed.&nbsp; When you right click on your printer,
 do you get the selection of Preferences?&nbsp; What about Properties?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you just upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp; Now settings for your printer are gone?&nbsp; Usually, there exists drivers for printers.&nbsp; There is also the full featured printer software that gives you more options and the ability to do more, like scanning with an all-in-one,
 plus, you get the driver, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the manufacturers support website.&nbsp; Some can auto-detect your printer.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Beta App audio bug</h2>
                    Hello, I have played 2 different games on the Xbox Beta app so far. Rise of the Tomb Raider and Recore. Both of these games have an audio bug, the dialogue is silent &amp; very faint. I can barely hear the dialogue and it's only coming through on my left speaker
 of my headset.&nbsp;

    <title>How can I make a Desktop icon always open URL in max window&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make a Desktop icon always open URL in max window&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I think that I asked this a long time ago and I thought I knew how to do this, but it ain''t working for me.</p>
<p>I have an icon on my Desktop (I only keep a few there) and it is set to open /*** link removed ***/. But for some reason, it always just opens that site&nbsp;in a half-sized window. I have maxxed it (manually and with the [_] button up in the right corner) and
 then closed it and it still opens in a less that maximized view. I can't even remember where it got that window size from....</p>
<p>I've even restarted Windows XP after maxxing it and shutting it, and it still opens in this small size. And I made sure that I didn't see an End Now for Explorer while it was shutting down Windows, since I have learned that that program stores some of this
 junk.</p>
<p>I've right-clicked the icon on the Desktop and I hoped to find a checkbox titled
<em><strong>Open Maximized</strong></em>, but there ain't one like that anywhere.</p>
<p>I even use cCleaner and I checked a box in the Windows section on the Advanced tab which says Window Size/Location Cache and then I ran the cCleaner. Then I restarted Windows and tried opening that URL using the Desktop icon and it still opened in the half-sized
 Window.</p>
<p>Arghhhh!</p>

            The desktop shortcut you created may have some from a browser's <i>File, Send, Shortcut to Desktop</i>&nbsp;command or something similar. This creates the&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;of half-a-shortcut in that it records the target URL but not the program that lauches the target
 URL. Instead, it relies upon the <i>file association</i>&nbsp;and <i>default browser</i>&nbsp;settings to launch the web page from the URL. Since you have no executable program in the shortcut, you are not given the choice of opening in a
<i>maximized, minimized</i>&nbsp;or floating application window.<br />
<br />
The following should be the correct procedure to creating an Internet Explorer shortcut to
<i>&lt;your url&gt;</i> that will allow setting the display state of the application window.
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Right-click a blank area of the&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<i>New, Shortcut</i>.</li><li>
For&nbsp;<i>Type the location of the item:</i>&nbsp;type or paste in,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"%PROGRAMFILES%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" &lt;your url here&gt;</i><br />
When you have this in the text box, click&nbsp;<i>Next</i>. If the location of the browser application is incorrect, you will be asked to repair it.</li><li>
Supply a name for the new shortcut and click&nbsp;<i>Finish</i>&nbsp;in the lower right.</li><li>
Right-click your new desktop shortcut and select&nbsp;<i>Maximized</i>&nbsp;from the <i>Run</i>&nbsp;options on the
<i>Sharing</i>&nbsp;tab.</li></ol>
<div>
Your new shortcut should now open in a maximized window. Another option is to open Internet Explorer in full
<i>kiosk</i>&nbsp;mode (e.g. <i>full screen</i>) by adding <i>-k</i>&nbsp;to the command line like,<br />
<br />
<i>"%PROGRAMFILES%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -k &lt;your url here&gt;</i><br />

            This answer is a joke correct? Cookies have nothing to do with browser history and I'm not even a Micro Engineer. This is a serious bug that needs to be addressed.&nbsp;

            <p>In my computer which keeps history well, I observed that there were times in which the history list just took too long to show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you should try to wait 2 or 3 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why deleting cookies and in addition all that related stuff is unhelpful? I suggest that you should try it and moreover you should check in Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options for history settings. Nevertheless I assume that these internet options are having
 effect in Microsoft Edge, I do not have any proof for it.</p>

            <p>I spoke to HP support and after more than an hour of trying different things without success, the HP analyst created a new User for me, transferred my data files, and successfully tested that the history was displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She wasn't certain, but felt that I may have had a file corruption issue...which may be a "catch all" response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, the new user works fine.&nbsp; Issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I find that the functionality of the History tab in Edge is far inferior to that of Internet Explorer (can't sort, can't search, etc).&nbsp; I hope that they add these shortly.</p>

            <p>Very strange...sometimes the history shows up, sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the history data is there, the issue is just with displaying it.&nbsp; Sometimes, I will simply close the browser, then reopen it, and the history is displayed...but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This and other issues with Edge make me feel that it's not yet ready for prime time.</p>

            I, too, have this&nbsp;problem. Sometimes&nbsp;my history is&nbsp;there and sometimes not. When it reappears, all the sites I visited are there, so it is recording my history, just not always displaying.

    <title>Battlefield Hardline for Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helibobs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlefield Hardline for Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>My son had downloaded the Beta version to play on &amp; asked my ex hubby to buy the game on disc for him for his birthday (came out on release the day before his birthday).... he woke up excited on saturday morning to play it... put the disc in to install...
 it seemed to take forever, then son saw "installation, this requires xbox 360 hard drive &amp; 3.5gb of free space"..... as son has the 4gb version &amp; has to use a memory stick for games such as GTA &amp; Far Cry... he selected that storage option.... but the following
 message appeared ... "device not allowed... the game only permits installing HD content on the xbox360 hard drive"..... he has over 30 games for xbox &amp; has never come across this message before... left us puzzled... we removed everything physically possible
 off his xbox onto his memory stick, only things left were system things that couldnt be moved... still leaves only 2.9gb of free space... so i contacted xbox who suggested a hard drive... duly went out &amp; bought a toshiba external hard drive... we connected
 it &amp; selected that as storage option... but game still shows the same message that device not allowed! ... we tested the hard drive by moving things from his memory stick onto it &amp; we know it works... contacted EA games about it &amp; they say we need an internal
 hard drive? .... spoke to xbox again &amp; they said the external hard drive should work.... i am very confused now &amp; my son is extremely disappointed.... any help gratefully accepted ... thanks</p>

<p>The official hard drive is built to be used with the 360,the Toshiba one isn't &amp; would be seen as a usb flash drive.There are a few more reasons but the only way to get your game to work is to buy an official 360 hard drive.</p>

<p>Any dedicated game shop or online game shop will stock them.Avoid places like Amazon etc. as they sell some very convincing 3rd party hard drives which wouldn't be any good.</p>
<p>Depending on what type of 360 you have would depend on the hdd to get.</p>

    <title>Windows Update Error Code 80070308 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helicase_715  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error Code 80070308</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand-new computer--only a week old--running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, with SP 1. I'm having trouble with Windows Update. I should add first that I do not have Automatic Update enabled--instead I have it check for updates, then I download and
 install them when I'm not working on my computer. Every time I try to download updates, it installs a few, but then I get an error message that the updates have failed with the code
<strong>80070308</strong>. It's always this error code. Unfortunately Microsoft doesn't list this error code on their help page, so I'm hoping someone may be able to help me decipher it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Fix-It application and Windows Update Troubleshooter twice, with no success--Fix-It found no problems, while the troubleshooter took over an hour to run and said that it "could not identify the problem." When I tell Update to "check for updates,"
 it takes over an hour for it to come up with any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's any help, the only updates that I was able to install yesterday were all for the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm running the latest version of Norton Antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong with my Windows Update, and how to fix it? Thank you so much for any advice!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>***UPDATE***</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching through similar threads, I've found and tried two fixes. The popular
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-update-fails-with-code-80070308/f5b42dbc-3776-4051-beb2-f4d211bb0681?page=1">
RegEdit fix suggested here</a> doesn't work for me. The other option is to rename or delete the SoftwareDistribution folder, but I can't rename it because the folder is currently in use. How do I stop Windows Update to rename/delete this folder, and once I'm
 done, how do I start it again? &nbsp;And most of all...is this actually a good way to fix it, or is this going to set me up for more problems in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>***FIXED!!!***</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Fantastic news--the problem is gone! Check out Canadian Tech's answer below if you have the same problem, and the RegEdit and renaming/deleting the SoftwareDistribution folder tricks don't work. It took only about a half hour, not a whole day. Windows Update
 found updates quickly, downloaded them smoothly, and installed everything without an issue...it works like it's supposed to! A huge thanks to all of you who offered advice!</p>

            <p>I doubt very much you are using a product named Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; That product has not been sold for nearly 2 years.&nbsp; You are running one of their all-in-one packages, which I would suspect could be the villan.&nbsp; Try disabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start Windows Update (WU), if your computer has not been up and running for a few days or more, start it and let it run without using it for some hours.&nbsp; Turn off the sleep functions if they are set.&nbsp; If yours is a laptop, make sure it is powered
 with the power cord.&nbsp; Start Task Manager (right-click on the task bar) and look at the CPU % in use at the bottom of that window.&nbsp; If it is more than 10%, you have to wait until what ever the computer is doing finishes before starting Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Functions like Antivirus update and &nbsp;scans, scheduled defragmentation, updates to Java, Flash Player, Adobe Reader and others must be completed BEFORE you start Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did this on a laptop that had not been used for about 70 days.&nbsp; It took the best part of a day to finally settle down and be ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is dramatically slower than it was in the Spring of 2015, before Windows 10 began downloading.&nbsp; There may be nothing wrong with your computer!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed sending
 millions of unrequested 5 gigabyte Win10 files&nbsp;to Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network that normally services you and I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason to do this upgrade unless you are a real adventurer.&nbsp; Windows 7 will be supported through January 2020.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have seen cases where the green bar in Windows Update&nbsp;continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off sleep and hibernate functions.&nbsp; Leave WU running at least overnight, maybe longer</p>
<p>Check to make certain the 4 needed services are starting properly.&nbsp; If any one of the services, were not already started, type services in the text box above the start globe and find each of those services&nbsp;in the list (list below).&nbsp;If they are not set to
 automatic, double-click the service and set.&nbsp; You can do this while Windows Update is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background Intelligent Transfer Services, Cryptographic services, Windows Installer, Windows Update. They should be shown as Automatic or Automatic (delayed). If they are not, double-click on each as necessary, and change setting to Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Set Windows Update settings to NEVER before you start</strong>.&nbsp; The never setting&nbsp;will prevent that phenomena where WU is running and then you check and see an yellow exclamation point on the shut down button. That situation results in a kind of
 tug of war between competing WU rivals.</p>
<p>Check Task manager BEFORE you start WU.&nbsp; If your system is very busy, it may produce that 80070490 error and that&nbsp;“try again” button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait and watch&nbsp;that % at the bottom of the task manager window for a while untill it settles down to below 10%.&nbsp; Then try
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, we need to prepare your system to properly handle Windows Updates.&nbsp; It will take a long time (like a day or more), but in almost all cases this gets Windows Update back on track.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download and run the correct version for your system of the System Update Readiness tool KB947821.&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/what-is-the-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 need X64.</li><li>Download KB3145739 from the Microsoft web site and install it.32 bit version:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=51857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=51853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Now re-start Windows Update.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;NOT restart Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be very, very patient, it will likely take a long time.&nbsp; Recently, the whole process has required 24 hours or more elapsed time in my work on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Now, your challenge is to be PATIENT.&nbsp; This may take many hours.&nbsp; </strong>

<h2>            VPN, won&#39;t disconnect, freezes</h2>
                    Okay, so I have a brand new Dell Latitude E4300, Vista.&nbsp; Everything works as it should until I get to messing with the VPN.&nbsp; I set up it all normally and everything, no problem.&nbsp; However, it is when I turn it on the first time that everything goes haywire.<br />
<br />
I can connect just fine.&nbsp; When I go to disconnect, it says that it does, but doesn't.&nbsp; In the task bar wireless connection icon freezes as does the network sharing center.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On the slim-to-none chance that it chooses not to freeze, then other oddities surface.&nbsp; For example, although I am offline, it shows that I am connected to both the VPN and the wireless connection.&nbsp; Or, on the rare occasion that it does disconnect, it refuses
 to re-connect.&nbsp; Either way, it takes FOREVER for the system to reboot.<br />
<br />
Even though it is a new laptop, I rebuilt the system from scratch<br />
I added local service to admins<br />
I ran virus software<br />
I turned off both Windows firewall and Symantec<br />
Turned off IPv6 on all connections<br />
A reboot will solve the issue until the VPN is turned back on.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            JUST AN FYI.&nbsp; I finally figured it out.&nbsp; It was Symantec blocking the application.&nbsp; I made sure all Windows updates were installed, all Symantec, and then turned off intrusion prevention.
