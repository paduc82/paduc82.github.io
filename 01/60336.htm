<h2>            Windows Installer could not be accessed and msiexec.exe is unsupported 16-bit application</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I have Windows 7 Premium and lately, my Windows Installer hasn't been working. It might have been from a registry cleaning tool that I used back in June. I couldn't install iTunes, but I just brushed it off. Now I need to install software for a class, but
 I can't. I just get a message saying Windows Installer can not be accessed. I tried the unregistering and reregistering the registry values, using some registry fix/patch (for vista or xp, I forget which), and even reinstalling it. It was only later that I
 realized that Windows 7 has Windows Installer 5.0 instead of the 4.5 that is redistributable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to run some programs, I also get message saying my "\??\C:\windows\system32\msiexe.exe cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of Windows."</p>
<p>Then immediately afterwards, I get a message saying "Error creating &lt;msi/i vcredist.msi. Reason: C:\windows\system32\advpack.dll" with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable at the top.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated very much. Thank you in advance.</p>

                    I double click the e-mail message as suggested in the help section, but no information bar appears to allow me to display the image. I also tried to auto download all e-mail images by clearing "Block images and other external content in HTML e-mail" and

<p><span>Hi JerKil,<br />
<br />
I just want to add a few things to what Don already have you try.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You might want to temporary disable that real time email protection and see if you can download the images.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also try to add the sender to your safe list in both Windows Mail and Antivirus Email Scanner (if the option is available).<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will allow the program to know that is a safe sender to download and display images in their email always.</span></p>
<p><span>Here's an article I ran across researching your problem about different email formats from Ask Leo.com.&nbsp; He provides
 an excellent explaination of the different formats that email came in.<span>&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;Thought it might be interesting to you.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<strong><span>Summary</span></strong><span>: Pictures in email don't always display. The reasons pictures in email
 don't display are many, and confusing. We'll look at some of the factors.</span></p>
<p><em><span>I often get pictures sent to me by some people. Sometimes when I open the mail, I see the pictures automatically,
 other times instead of the picture all I see is something like pic123.jpg, and I have to click on each attachment separately to see them. This thing kind of comes and goes on its own. Can you please solve the mystery?</span></em></p>
<p><span>Yes, I think I can. And it is a bit of a mystery, involving a complex mix of email formats, email programs, and
 email security settings.</span></p>
<p><span>It may look like it comes and goes, but there's actually method behind the apparent madness. Complex method,
 but method nonetheless.</span></p>
<p>
<span>•</span></p>
<p><span>As I said there are at least three things that can come into play to determine how an email program displays
 images in an email. And, of course, within each of those three things are more possibilities.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Email Format</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Email can be formatted to include the images in-line or as attachments. That means part of what determines how
 the email is displayed is exactly what format the sender used to compose their email.</span></p>
<p><span>HTML and Rich Text formatted email both allow images to be embedded within the actual message. Naturally, there
 are different ways to do this; for example the image can be included within the email as an attachment to be displayed within the message, or the image can be linked to from a web site. Both formats also allow images to simply be included as regular attachments
 without any relationship to the message body.</span></p>
<p><span>"...part of what determines how the email is displayed is exactly what format the sender used to compose their
 email.</span></p>
<p><span>Plain text email, on the other hand, only allows for images as attachments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Email Programs</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Some email programs try to be helpful. When they receive an email that has images as attachments not meant to
 display in the body of the message, they automatically display the attachments after the body of the message. This avoids you having to open each attachment by hand ... you simply scroll down the message, and there they are.</span></p>
<p><span>This apparently confuses come people, because they see the attachments as part of the message body when they
 are not. Thus, when they switch to a different email program that behaves differently, they believe the new program to be broken. A great example is that Microsoft Outlook Express will display attached images below the message, and
<a href="http://ask-leo.com/why_do_pictures_in_email_sometimes_show_up_inline_and_sometimes_as_attachments.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Microsoft Office Outlook</span></a> will not. Neither is right or wrong, they're simply different.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet another possibility is that some email programs will display the in-line images as "normal" attachments in
 addition to displaying them in the message body. Remember that I said that one of the ways in-line images could be included is as attachments with the email that are referenced from within the body of the email. Some programs simply see those as more attachments
 to be listed like any other.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Email Security Settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The security settings in effect in your email program have a major role in determining how in-body images are
 displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>Most email programs will automatically allow images that are intended to display in the body of an HTML or Rich
 Text message, </span><em><span>if</span></em><span> those images were included (as attachments) with the email. If
 the images are referenced from an external website, then most programs will </span>
<em><span>not</span></em><span> display them until you specifically indicate that they should be; and even then, you'll
 need to be connected to the <a href="http://ask-leo.com/why_do_pictures_in_email_sometimes_show_up_inline_and_sometimes_as_attachments.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>internet</span></a> in order to fetch the images.</span></p>
<p><span>Some programs allow you to indicate that certain senders are "safe", and that images in email coming from those
 addresses can be displayed immediately. Other programs will assume the same thing if a sender is in your contacts or address book.</span></p>
<p><span>Occasionally security
<a href="http://ask-leo.com/why_do_pictures_in_email_sometimes_show_up_inline_and_sometimes_as_attachments.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>software</span></a> outside of your email program, such as firewalls or anti-<a href="http://ask-leo.com/why_do_pictures_in_email_sometimes_show_up_inline_and_sometimes_as_attachments.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>malware</span></a>
 programs, can also interfere and prevent images from being displayed properly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Three Rules of Thumb</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can't control how your sender formats the email you're getting, but there are some steps you can take to
 maximize the chances that you'll see images. Exactly how you do these, and perhaps even whether you need to, will depend on exactly what email program and possibly what security software you have running on your machine.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Understand how your email program handles images as attachments, and whether or not you should even expect to see them below the body. If it's important to you,
 see if there's a setting to enable it. If not, and it's very important to you, consider using a different mail program.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Add the addresses of people you know and/or expect email from to your address book, or to your "safe senders" list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure that your firewall or other security software doesn't get in the way of your email program's security. For example, if your email program is properly
 blocking and allowing images from the right sets of senders, there's no reason to have your firewall try to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Hope this help,</span></p>

            First of all let me thank Don, Sail 1234 and Kevin for your help.&nbsp; I have looked at my security software and windows mail in detail and it looks like all of the settings are ok. Because of the terminology I may have missed something important, but everything
 seems to be ok. Kevin, the article from Ask Leo.com was very interesting. I took his advice and put the addresses of the people I know and get e-mails from on my "safe sender list". Since I have done that I have not had the problem. Hopefully that takes care
 of the situation. Incidently, I sent a reply e-mail to the person that had sent me the original pattern that didn't print and she resent it as an attachment and it came through fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help,<br />
<br />

            <p>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just XP/Vista/7) have a 4GB<br />address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the<br />theoretical upper limit beyond which you can not go. <br />But you can't use the entire&nbsp; address space. Even though you have a<br />4GB address space, you can only use <strong>around</strong> 3.1GB of RAM. That's<br />because some of that space is used by hardware and is not available to<br />the operating system and applications. The amount you can use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can<br />range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around<br />3.1GB. <br />Note that the hardware is using the address <strong>space</strong>, not the actual<br />RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM<br />goes unused because there is no address space to map it to. Ken Blake, Microsoft MVP</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 Realtek RTL8188EE WI-FI keeps dropping out</h2>
                    <p>Running HP Pavilion laptop with a Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11 bgn WI-FI adapter. For over a month now WI-FI has been dropping out. Sometimes just turning the WI-FI back on would restore the connection. Then other time rebooting was necessary. Then the big one
 a SYSTEM RESTORE was needed to retrieve the adapter back into the DEVICE MANAGER, SCAN FOR HARDWARE CHANGES wouldn't bring it back.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have tried the NETWORK TROUBLE SHOOTER (Got stuck on COLLECTING CONFIGURATION DETAILS, rebooted after waiting an hour).</li><li>Ran CMD as ADMIN &nbsp;Cmd&gt;netsh winsock reset (System wouldn't finish shutting down on RESTART (have to POWER off and restart).</li><li>DISABLED the WI-FI adapter then uninstalled the driver and deleted the driver. Downloaded the latest driver from REALTEK&nbsp;2023.15.701.2015 installed as WINDOWS 8 Compatibility mode.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Can't believe I am the only one with this problem. Does anyone know the real solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tied to the router via a hard line. Seems to be counter to the idea of laptop and WI-FI. Oh, have several other devices connected to the same router one being a HP PRO tablet running Windows 10. That has no connection problems. All within 15 feet of
 each other.</p>

I have seen the reply by Rakesh but cannot follow the reboot link. I am using my old reliable desktop to find a solution. My HP Laptop has no Internet connection! &nbsp;Can I download a solution to a USB flash drive to install onto my laptop?

    <title>HP Elitebook Folio 9470m - can&#39;t use higher resolutions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phill_r  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Elitebook Folio 9470m - can&#39;t use higher resolutions</h2>
                    Hello, on my laptop the highest resolutio navailable is 1024 x 768. I'm unable to get the higher widescreen resolutions.<br />
<br />
In my display settings, under the Monitor tab, my laptop display is showing up as "Generic PnP Monitor". My sense is that the issue lies somewhere with that. I've updated to the latest HP display drivers and have rebooted my system to no avail.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Thank you!<br />

    <title>Stuttering and Noise Squealing in Game Bf1 and a bit in Audio Apps, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuttering and Noise Squealing in Game Bf1 and a bit in Audio Apps, Failures to load some apps altogether. Used to work no problem. can&#96;t find a fix myself</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>My PC on Windows 10 started having Audio and stuttering problems very recently. Prior to that everything ran completely fine. I had a similar problem more than a year ago, its fixable but i dont know how, maybe i did recover the entire PC back then.
 I want to avoid that if possible since it involves days of work to get everything installed and back running after that.
</span></p>
<p><span>I started noticing the issue in the game battlefield 1, where it is most frequent and noticable.It also occurs minimally in fx Spotify where the tracks sound as if they were from a radio with a few stutters. I also noticed having the same problem in
 youtube. Its most apparent in the game Battlefield 1 though where the errors also are visible and audible at a much higher frequency.
</span></p>
<p><span>A short clip so you know what I mean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHAJG9rRCAA
</span></p>
<p><span>Here's the issue: As you can see and hear in the video I have a weird issue with the entire frame freezing for very short times and the sound compressing to a glitchy sound.</span></p>
<p><span>Just few days ago it ran fine with no issues and fluently. The Gpu is usually between 50-70% load and the Memory usage is around 2Gb from 3Gb Total. It's a R9 280x Factory OC, I had it for a long time and</span></p>
<p><span>did not experience issues until now in Bf1. The Cpu is a i5-4460, running at normal Temps as usual and with 70-80% load. The Hard Drive runs at normal loads too and does not max out within the game. Ram 8Gb, same thing, not maxed out at all.</span></p>
<p><span>What i tried so far:</span></p>
<p><span>Removed the Graphics drivers and did clean install, tried the newest driver, rerolled to an old on.</span></p>
<p><span>Checked PC for defragmentation, not necessary it's at 0%.</span></p>
<p><span>Registry has no issues either, just cleaned it.</span></p>
<p><span>Removed several Background processes, removed the last programs i had installed just in case.</span></p>
<p><span>Removed Temp files from Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course the fix-all Pc restart.. and it did not help</span></p>
<p><span>I looked what else had changed in my Pc since a few days back only thing i can still imagine is a faulty windows update although the last recorded update was</span></p>
<p><span>prior to the issue and the daily Antivirus updates.</span></p>
<p><span>I deactivated the antivirus and started the game, did not help either.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried repairing the game in origin.</span></p>
<p><span>Checked if anything from the Gaming evolved stuff could be affecting it, seems not, i don't usually keep that app running anyway.</span></p>
<p><span>I disabled Origin in game.</span></p>
<p><span>Tried various settings tweaks on Bf1 Dx11/Dx12 etc. noticed that the issue does not occur if there is no destruction and no shooting. (unrelated to framerate though since it even occurs on the lowest settings possible)</span></p>
<p><span>I kept Task manager and a GPU tool open during the game whilst trying to find the issue, could not see anything unusual, no process acting weird, no abnormal values, nothing maxed out the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>Update; I deactivated the AMD audio driver, tried Windows Audio repair options, restarted pc. Then one round of Bf1 ran with only one weird stutter. Next round it exponentially increased until it became unplayable. Apparently spotify has minimal stutter
 too but it does not exponentially increase. Bf4 refuses to load the map, it just shows in battlelog: game ready. but there is no game, it does not start its own window. And now i noticed how its also in youtube and all other applications with sound. (Originally
 i posted this in a battlefield forum and got no replies, i edited the text and inserted here)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I deinstalled several programs i had installed the past week, did not help me at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What can I still try to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone else with the same or a similar problem?</span></p>

    <title>Tell Tale Into the Badlands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> real dangerr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tell Tale Into the Badlands</h2>
                    I've been thinking of a great Tell Tale series Into the Badlands. It's a great tv show and it has amazing martial arts choreographed. What y'all think? Would it be a hit? The characters are amazing in the story and their backgrounds in their past is great.
 Let me know...

            If unfortunately never heard of the show but since TellTale Games has shut down it would be difficult to make another game by that Studio. However there are plenty of other Developers out there that you could pitch this to that do the "choose your path"
 narrative games!! :D

            This would have been an amazing TTG series, they could have explored so much in the way of the other Barons or The Gift.&nbsp; Hey maybe Square would make the game, theyve done well with episodic games!

<p><span>Hi kingspliff,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Restart UPNP (Universal Plug and Play) Device Host service and Windows media player network sharing service</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type “Services.msc” (without quotes) and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Scroll
 down until you find UPNP Host Device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on it and click restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service and restart it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if Xbox can detect your computer for media sharing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable your anti-virus software (including spyware/malware/firewalls)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If<span>you</span>
<span>have</span> an additional software firewall, try disabling it and check if you’re able to see your computer through Xbox 360.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

            You solution worked.&nbsp; It was the windows defender.&nbsp; I've had this happen multiple times with my Xbox over the years and it's usually after some update for the Xbox or the computer and I have to reopen sharing for my files and make sure my Xbox is still
 on my network.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have &nbsp;windows 8 and really don't like it.&nbsp; at least Media Center came with the older packages but now they want $9.99 for it.&nbsp; Thanks MS.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Bryan, is this a keyboard shortcut or the Bluetooth icon in the system tray?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP provide their own software for this type of functionality, suggest checking their downloads site for your version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Windows 8.1 comes with it's own toggle functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong></li><li>Click <strong>PC and Devices</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Bluetooth</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Network</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Flightmode</strong></li></ol>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the insights however upon implementing they did not work. I do not have any installed antivirus on my PC hence Norton was not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem with a key in the CLASSES_ROOT folder which required me to reformat my machine as it was corrupt. Cant really remember the exact key name. It caused the problem with my airplane mode toggle and bluetooth toggle being grayed out. I dunno
 whether this is a common problem and if it is kindly assist me with the mechanics of solving it in the near future. Otherwise after reformatting my PC all is good now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan.</p>

<h3> denny gardener  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image Backup breaks Windows Update and Intel Drivers</h2>
                    <p>What's the point of a System Image Backup that won't restore your computer to the condition it was in when the backup was created?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the situation with Windows 8.1. When I restore a system image, the following problems are created:</p>

<li>Windows Update loses its Update History. When I "review your update history", it says (falsely) "you have not tried to install any updates for your computer". If you run troubleshooter, it finds and fixes a problem, but the Update History is still blank.</li><li>The System Device&gt;&nbsp;Intel Management Engine Interface stops working. You have to uninstall from Control Panel and then reinstall to get it working again.</li><li>The Event Log is not restored. It shows events that occurred after the System Image was created but before it was restored. Why isn't the Event Log included in the System Image?</li></ol>
<p>When I restored a Norton Ghost image in Windows XP, the computer was exactly like it was when the image was created. It behaved like it had simply been turned off from the time the image was made until it was restored. This is definitely not the case with
 Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>Hi Fernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you further explain what happens or what you mean when you say the console is blocked or locked when playing online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error messages that you can share with us? Does it say that you are not connected to Xbox Live or to the EA servers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to play other games online or are you able to play FIFA 19 local?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know this clarifying information and we'll see what we can do to figure this out.</p>

<p>today i noticed on my microsoft account , in the devices menu that my PC was listed two times.</p>
<p>So i deleted one of them since it was duplicated.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if removing the pc from that list will be a problem with my windows 10 key, for example if i decide to do a clean install.</p>

<p>Hello Frank,</p>
<p>There are two possible answers to your question (based on how it's interpreted).&nbsp; I will try to cover both of them for you.</p>
<p>If your question is can you access your desktop that's running Windows 7 from a laptop, the answer is maybe.&nbsp; If you're running Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate, then the answer is yes.&nbsp; If you're running any other version, the official answer
 is "no."&nbsp; They do not have the capability of accepting Remote Desktop Connections.</p>
<p>If you're asking can you remotely access a computer from a Windows 7 computer, then the answer is yes.&nbsp; You would use the Remote Desktop Connection (found in the Start orb --&gt; All Programs --&gt; Accessories menu) to access the other computer (assuming that
 it has Remote Desktop Enabled).</p>
<p>If you're asking how to enable Remote Access (and assuming you're on one of the supported versions of Windows 7), you'll go to Control Panel --&gt; System&nbsp; (or right click on Computer and choose Properties).&nbsp; From there,&nbsp; You'll chose Remote Settings on the

<h2>            I Met November&#39;s Game Pass &#34;Goals&#34; Reward Criteria, But Never Received Any Reward&#33;</h2>
                    <p>i have a issue with the game pass "goals".. i didn't receive anything, despite having met the criteria in november, for the "reward valued at $5". i had the 14 day trial at the beginning of november and completed the goal(s) even before my trial ended. then after my trial ended, there was a week where i didn't have the game pass service, but then got the service again half-way through november.. i'm not sure if that lapse in time was the reason i didn't get any sort of "reward" or anything like that...</p><p><br /></p>

<p>i checked the "messages from xbox" area on my xbox, and i had received a message on november 7th saying "here's a $5 code on us, to kick off your holiday shopping for that perfect gift.". then on november 16th, i got a message saying "warframe's biggest expansion ever is here and to celebrate we're giving you a code for a few in-game items..". but there was nothing there that was related to the game pass goals reward...</p>

    <title>Cannot install network adapter drivers in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinheron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install network adapter drivers in Windows 7</h2>
                    <span><span>
                    <span><span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased the upgrade version of Windows 7 last week, to upgrade from Vista. After I installed the upgrade, the PC could not connect to my wireless internet (the network didn't show up for available connections). The network troubleshooter wasn't able
 to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured it might be that my network adapter drivers were outdated, so I downloaded the latest and tried to install them (my network adapter is integrated within the<strong> Asus P5K Deluxe/WiFi-AP</strong> motherboard). When I direct Windows to install
 those drivers for the adapter, it finds them and begins to install, but comes into an error. The message says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Followed by the name of the adapter (Realtek RTL8187)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Followed by "A device attached to the system is not functioning."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know why this would happen, but I tried numerous Realtek drivers, including several Vista drivers, tried with and without Compatibility Mode. None of this worked, so I brought my PC to the other room to plug it into the Ethernet in the hopes that
 a Windows Update would fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting connected, the Win Update installed, but my wireless adapter would still not install correctly (same error message as above). My friend happened to have a spare Linksys network card (<strong>Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G</strong>) so he gave it
 to me, we assuming it would work around the problem of my integrated network adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put in the card, and Windows detected it and began to install the drivers. Once again, it failed to install, with the same error message as before: "...encountered and error while attempting to install it" followed by "a device attached to the system is
 not functioning."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(screencap of the error message: http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/6995/capturepd.png)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to Linksys' site to download and manually install the drivers. No use; again the drivers began to install but I ended up with the same exact error message that the device was not functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Device Manager under Network Adapters, "Network Controller" has a yellow exclamation by it because the drivers are not installed. Under its Properties, the Device Status pane reads: "This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A device attached to the system is not functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, of course, clicking "Update Driver" leads me back to the error message whether I use Automatic Update or manually pick out the drivers I've downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had three very experienced PC users look into this and no one has an answer, as well as hours of scouring Google and the Windows support forums to no avail. I've ran Windows' System File Checker which found no issues. I'm out of ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I thought this post could help me even though it deals with an external USB adapter rather than an integrated and/or PCI card:&nbsp;<span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/f1fafb17-b31c-4e68-bde1-df717684cbdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/f1fafb17-b31c-4e68-bde1-df717684cbdc</a>.&nbsp;</span><span>But
 following the instructions in the reply, looking in regedit in the directory specified, I couldn't find a "LowerFilters." Although there is an UpperFilters.</span></p>

<p>When you upgraded to Windows 7, did you install the desktop/notebook utility(Dell Computers) and the chipset drivers first? If not, the rest of the drivers will fail to install. The Utility and the chipset drivers help to install the attached devices, USB

</blockquote>
<p>Well I just realized I was looking up the wrong motherboard (I have the <strong>
Asus P5K-E</strong>) but the chipset download is the same as the other mobo anyway (the one I downloaded the other day). I re-downloaded the Win7 chipset from the Asus site, and it said it installed successfully. After rebooting, no luck installing network
 adapter (same error message).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Wireless driver on the Asus site for the mobo for Win7, but there is one for Vista. I have tried installing the Win7 chipset and then installing the Vista wireless drivers (no luck), and also installing the Vista chipset in Compatibility Mode
 and installing the Vista wireless drivers (no luck).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried installing the Vista chipset in Compatibility Mode and then installing all the other drivers I can see on the Vista page (LAN install wizard said I had a newer version of the drivers already, SATA wizard said "Your computer does not meet the requirements"
 even in compat mode) and <em>then </em>installing the Vista wireless drivers in compat mode. The Vista wireless driver says it installs correctly, but in Device Mngr the "Network Controller" still shows as being without drivers, and any attempt to install
 drivers fails just as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing something, is there something special I need to do to install new chipset drivers? I don't see anywhere in Device Mngr to uninstall current the chipset software.</p>

<p>I don't see how any of the Dell utilities or install orders should apply, I don't own a Dell. It's a built-from-scratch computer, and a lot of the instructions on that help page only apply to Dells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't originally install chipset drivers when I upgraded, because I had no idea I'd have to, and I had no idea chipsets might be related to my issues connecting to the wireless network. However, I have now tried updating my chipset software, from the
 Asus site, using both the Windows 7 drivers and the Vista drivers in Compat Mode, but doing neither of those allowed me to install network adapter drivers without getting that error message.</p>

<p>I really appreciate the quick responses from you guys, but I still haven't found a solution to this problem, despite repeated attempts to install Vista and Win7 drivers for my mobo, in various chronologies, and with various Compatibility settings. I've allowed
 Windows to verify every chipset driver and card driver I can, and still it tells me my network device is "not configured properly" or is "not functioning."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There don't seem to be many options right now aside from buying another mobo, which I can't really afford.</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>You can try installing the drivers in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>You might also try installing them with your anti-virus temporarily disabled, as it can sometimes cause a conflict.</p>
<p>I see that you have chipset drivers for this PC, were there wireless card drivers for WIn7?</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>I have exactly the same problem as you and too been trying everything.&nbsp; Mine is a DELL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Done Safe Mode.&nbsp; Different Dell Chipset drivers (doesnt even seem to install them!). Different Wifi cards. Even tried a USB wifi card with the same problem.&nbsp; So it's
 an error somewhere to do with the Networking, not the PCI, as it happen on USB too.</p>
<p>It is a problem with the Vista -&gt; Windows 7 update, as I tried installing on a new hard drive with a fresh installl of Windows 7 and it worked absolutely fine and network card was working hunky dory.</p>
<p>God knows what is causing this "A device attached to the system is not functioning".&nbsp; All I know is that is a very generic catch all error inside Windows, which means it could be just about anything!!</p>
<p>I know I can do a clean install.&nbsp; BUT I am software developer and have tons and tons and tons of stuff to reinstall if I go for the fresh install route.&nbsp; I probably have to bie the bullet as a laptop without wifi is petty useless.</p>

            Same problem here, but did a fresh Windows 7 install (not upgrade) on an HP xw9400 motherboard. Tried three PCI wireless cards and two USB wireless cards. Windows 7 wont let me install any of them, even in safe mode, and with no Anti-Virus installed.

<h2>            Banned xbox 1s</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought&nbsp; a second hand xbox 1s to find out it has a console ban, I have contacted the seller to find out that he had no knowledge of the ban and after trying to get hold of the enforcement team for so long with no prevail, gave up and sold the console and quit console gaming and gone onto pc gaming instead.</p><p>Looking online and the amount of ppl trying to get hold of the enforcement teams over banned accounts and consoles for inknown reasons is increasingly hi, I have come off pc gaming to try console but feel it was a wrong choice as I have paid a lot of money for this console and the support line said I might as well use it as a paper weight but that is crazy.</p><p>I paid £150 for this console to find it useless which is not acceptable,&nbsp;pls tell me what can be done to sort the issues out or I am just going to take it's contents and build&nbsp;a pc out of it</p>

            <p>The warranty on a second-hand Xbox console is void, and the purchaser assumes the risk for any previous modifications or unauthorized activity. Even if the console’s ownership has changed, the console may still be subject to a ban. If you purchase a console that has been previously banned you will not be able to connect to Xbox Live, and the ban will not be lifted as a result of the change in ownership. XBLPET recommends customers who believe they have not committed actions on the service to warrant a ban to contact previous owners or users of the console.</p><p>If you have purchased or intend to purchase a second-hand Xbox, you can check its current ban status by entering its serial number into the <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/ConsoleCheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">Console Check Tool</font></a>. Please note that the current absence of a ban does not preclude the possibility of future enforcement action.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Driver Error - Can&#39;t connect MS Mouse - Can&#39;t update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ap11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Driver Error - Can&#39;t connect MS Mouse - Can&#39;t update BT driver &#40;Broadcom 2070&#41;</h2>
                    I have a bluetooth notebook wireless mouse 5000 from Microsoft, and it's always worked fine w/ my computer. Today it stopped connecting to my Win 7 PC x64 (HP Envy 14). &nbsp;It still works fine with my iMac, so it seems like the Win 7 computer is acting up.
 &nbsp;To my knowledge, there were not any programs installed on the computer at the time the mouse stopped working. &nbsp;(The mouse will disconnect without&nbsp;reconnecting&nbsp;every now and then, and just turning the mouse off and on fixes the problem.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I decided to uninstall the mouse, and try reinstalling it. &nbsp;Now, the computer cannot detect the mouse or any other bluetooth device when pairing. &nbsp;I tested this using another bluetooth mouse, a keyboard, and my phone. &nbsp;There are no error messages when
 looking at the device manager, the bluetooth icon in the taskbar, or the HP bluetooth assistant.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've put almost 5 hours of trying to fix the problem, and it's really driving me crazy. &nbsp;Here's what I've tried to do:</div>
<div>- gone into the services panel to make sure the BT services were running w/ all the right settings</div>
<div>- used the device manager to uninstall/reinstall BT drivers</div>
<div>- restarted the computer into boot mode to check for conflicting services</div>
<div>- installed the generic bluetooth installer (<a href="http://bluetoothinstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bluetoothinstaller.com/</a>)</div>
<div>- tried downloading new driver from Broadcom, but their installer tells me to contact the manufacturer of the BT card (which is them AFAIK)</div>
<div>- downloaded two different drivers from HP for Broadcom. The one built for my specific computer would not install due to a weird install error which I cannot seem to resolve. To fix this problem I've tried restarting the computer in boot mode, fixing services
 through command prompt, and repairing the .net installtions, but nothing has worked to resolve it.</div>
</div>
<div>- downloaded third-party software to try to detect incoming Bluetooth connections, but they couldn't see any activity when actively trying to pair devices to the computer</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing there's a small chance it's a hardware problem since no devices can connect. &nbsp;I really don't have the time to reinstall Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer comes with an HP Wireless Assistant program which has always worked fine, and just allows you to turn off the WIFI and Bluetooth signals independently. &nbsp;I've checked all of it's settings, and made sure no battery saving modes were checked.
 &nbsp;If the assistant wasn't installed, you'd have to go disabling in the device manager to do the same thing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has any additional ideas of what I could try, I'd really appreciate it. &nbsp;I don't really know where to go from here except buy a mouse w/ a cord.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Desktop &#38; Task Bar refresh every few minutes after Win 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marbrien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop &#38; Task Bar refresh every few minutes after Win 10 upgrade - with loss of focus, ejection from Win Explorer or Control panel</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, I do not have iCloud, iPhoto, Aeroglass or Bitdefender, which have been cited by others as culprits for this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The AV is McAfee.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated three other PCs to Windows 10 without incident, but my parents' Dell Inspiron N5040 laptop has been a real headache.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The migration was from Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit to Windows 10 Home via online upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Prior to the upgrade the laptop had been behaving quite normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outstanding issue is that every few minutes and without warning the Desktop and Task Bar refresh automatically.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are in Windows Explorer or the Control Panel when this happens, you are ejected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are in an application, the app loses focus and you lose anything you have just typed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The laptop is usable, but the problem is very irritating and likely to deter my mother from using it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task Manager showed that CPU usage was momentarily spiking at 100% when these refreshes occurred, but didn’t help at the process level, so I downloaded and ran Process Explorer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This shows that, when these refreshes happen, there are momentary peaks of activity in
<strong>ShellUI.exe</strong> and <strong>ShellExperienceHost.exe</strong>, the former apparently fractionally ahead of the latter.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have turned off Cortana and all the other user-adjustable search settings, but it makes no difference.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There appears to be no way to disable these processes.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not have the Desktop set to display a slide show, merely a still image.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have also used a solid colour; no difference.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Win 10 compatibility report suggested all would be well, but the upgrade was difficult.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For my first attempt I used the Win 10 upgrade icon in the Task Bar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I let it run for quite some time but it appeared to have hung.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I then used Media Creation Tool, this got to the end of downloading but announced that it could not perform the upgrade on this particular computer, citing error code 0x80070005 – 09x90002.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Following advice on an MS page, I downloaded the SubInACL Tool and created a Reset.cmd file, which I ran as administrator to fix registry permission errors which can cause this error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then ran used Media Creation Tool again and the upgrade completed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the screen then started flashing on and off so rapidly (every second or so) that the laptop was impossible to use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m not the only one who has had this, and I discovered the fix was to disable two MS services, ‘Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel Support’ and ‘Windows Error Report Service’.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Now I am left with the maddening screen refresh issue, which was not present before the upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
<span>Now I am left with the maddening screen refresh issue, which was not present before the upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know others have had this problem, but I haven’t as yet come across a solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can anyone help please?<span>&nbsp; </span></span>

<p>Hi Marbrien,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Desktop and Task bar keeps refreshing on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if there is existence of the software conflicts running in background or due to incompatibile, outdated, corrupted video driver.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Perform Safe mode with Networking</strong> . This will starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>

</span><span>the latest Video Driver for your computer, save it </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a USB drive. Copy it to the affected computer and install it. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you don’t get the driver that is compatible for Windows 10, you can download the driver that is compatible with Windows 8.1 and can make it run in Windows 10 with

            No, this is not the solution.&nbsp; What worked for me was to uninstall a program called IDT Audio, which was causing Windows Explorer to crash repeatedly, which was causing the refresh issue.&nbsp;

<p>Your advice prevented some probably serious nervous breakdown here.</p>
<p><strong>Uninstalling</strong> this <strong>IDT Audio</strong> helped me as well and the sound working no problem.</p>
<p>Taskbar refreshing constantly every few minutes, explorer closing ... solved at last.</p>
<p>How did you look and find this solution?</p>
<p>Let me learn something, so I can help myself with next Win10 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again.</p>

            <p>Thank You Marbrien! <br />

I had an HP Pro-Book 6560b suddenly start doing the same exact thing after an update this morning.
<br />
Uninstalled IDT Audio and the machine is working fine now - sounds and everything.
<br />
<br />
This machine was also a fresh build win7 upgraded to 10 over the web, didn't even install drivers for it or anything, in fact, I didn't even put it on the internet till I was ready to activate Win7 and upgrade to win10 - so I know this was installed by Windows
 10 update process or afterwards via windows update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It seems to be specific to certain machines as well - as I have deployed Windows 10 on several desktops and laptops - and thus far, only this HP laptop ended up with this IDT Audio program installed.&nbsp; Prior to, it was not installed, and the sound functions
 of the laptop were working fine.&nbsp; <br />
<br />

            Since I can't search for anything because this infuriating device keeps refreshing, when I look under program files for IDT Audio I just see a file (with multiple items in it) labeled IDT is this the same?&nbsp; I don't want to uninstall the wrong thing.

            IDT Audio ..I noticed it was using up a lot of processor ... but never thought removing it would fix a video problem. &nbsp;But it DID! &nbsp;THANK YOU! &nbsp;I spent 8 hours on this today .. I appreciate your post!!

            <p>Hi Marbrien,</p>
<p>I also have Desktop refresh issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own custom files for which I have my own shell extension for thumbnail display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is zip, so I extract this in users temp folder and delete once I get thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now problem comes when I copy paste multiple files of this type on desktop, my shell extension for Thumbnail runs into infinite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue comes with desktop only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please tell me what could be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Archana</p>

            I do not work for Microsoft.&nbsp; This sounds like a different problem, and it is not one with which I can help.&nbsp; Sorry.<br />

            <p>Mine was once every 60 seconds, like clockwork. &nbsp;None of the common files mentioned (IDT Audio, Bitdefender, etc.) were the culprit. &nbsp;It was&nbsp;MLCFG32.CPL, which was located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14 directory. &nbsp;I never installed the
 mail application, yet it was crashing explorer.exe.</p>
<p>I used these instructions (7th in list) to debug it (much thanks to Tractable):</p>
