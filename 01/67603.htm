            You should not use media CD/DVD for backups.&nbsp; I single scratch can render the whole set useless.&nbsp; Plus over time dvd players change.&nbsp; they may not even be able to read their own dvds.<br />
<br />
Best bet is a external HD or flash drive.<br />

    <title>booting win 10 using a fat32 flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanthotmail  say:</h3>
<h2>            booting win 10 using a fat32 flash drive</h2>
                    <p>Help me understand this plaease!!. My laptop has crashed and will not reboot, I beleive I have the "blue screen of death" and auto repair loop of doom. None of the recovery options work including full refresh which deletes everything. So my next step was
 to download win10 ISO from MS website onto my clean USB flash stick (which countless pages from google say I can do) BUT the ISO is 4.6Gb the USB is FAT32 which will not hold files larger than 4Gb. I formatted the USB stick to NTFS and tried again the download
 worked so the ISO is on a the flash BUT although the BIOS is set to UEFI and to boot from external disk the machine still won't boot, possibly because it doesnt like the NTFS format. How will I ever get this machine going again as I can't even see a way to
 put a fresh install on if the thing wont read the flash stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help </p>

            Hi Sean
<br />
<br />The first thing to try is to plug that USB into another USB hib (on the other side of your PC or laptop) some system swill only boot from certain USB ports . . 
<br />
<br />If that does not get you going:
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />If you still cannot get the installation started, please take a photo of the Boot Priority screen in BIOS and post that . . .

<p>Hi Dave</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. I have tried all these still no luck, it seems like whatever I do the machine just boots to auto repair screen. I have posted the pic you requested. The BIOS is in Legacy as you suggested at the time of taking the photo, however it
 usually is UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options seem limited and I couldn't see a CSM entry.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f2f9584-b7a0-4931-90a4-87a0947acbaf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f2f9584-b7a0-4931-90a4-87a0947acbaf?upload=true" /></a></p>

<br />
<br />Do you have access to another PC, if so, try booting that from your Installation media to make sure that is created correctly, I have a feeling it may not be . . .

            <p>I ran into the problem on my brand new Surface Book - and looked and tried everything and stumbled across both a work around, a permanent solution, and at least one root cause:<br />
<br />
<strong>WORKAROUND:</strong></p>
<p>If you're experienced with Regedit.exe (and I would really recommend before you try anything you make a backup copy of your registry), you can search through the registry and delete *every single instance* of the keys associated with the App ID. If you're
 not sure what an AppID or a registry key is, don't try this method as you can do serious damage to your machine.<br />
<br />
If you are pretty comfortable, you'll find that once you delete every instance of the app ID and associated keys from the registry (you may have to "take ownership" of certain registry key containers to do this, immediately the app will download.
<br />
<br />
However, it's only a workaround because it does NOT address the root problem. Also there are dozens and dozens of appID registry entries per app and it takes forever... and on the next app update, the you'll have to do the whole thing again making it not really
 the ideal approach.<br />
<br />
<strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong><br />
Because I figured out the workaround, I assumed that something during the Store Download process was corrupting the registry entries. There are a number of ways this can happen, but typically it has to do with a third party agent "packet sniffing" your WiFi
 network adapter. &nbsp;<br />
There are a number of applications (including antivirus) that legitimately have a purpose to do that, so this is where you should start investigating on your computer: Anything client on your PC that may have access to scanning, sniffing, or proxying your network
 adapter.<br />
<br />
<strong>MY SOLUTION:</strong><br />
In my case it wasn't a network adapter at all.&nbsp; I use "Hyper-V" to run virtual machines to do development without mucking up my Surfacebook. I'd enabled hyper-V and in order to give my virtual machines internet access, I set up a virtual network adapter and
 tethered it to my physical network adapter.<br />
<br />
As it turns out - even if your virtual machines are turned off, even if they are unattached, the mere *presence* of the virtual network adapter in hyper-V does some strange proxying of all the downloads on your physical machine: In my case, it was somehow corrupting
 the registry process when the Windows Store on my physical machine was trying to update.<br />
<br />
I turned off the virtual machines, removed the WiFi virtual adapters, then deleted the virtual adapter from each virtual machine configuration, and rebooted my machine: immediately every store application downloaded and installed without problems.<br />
<br />
I chased this for months and months with no success until the above. I hope this helps one of you, or at least helps you pinpoint on your machine exactly what is happening.</p>

You have to speify whether the " forgotten " password belongs to the admin account or just a standard user account.</p>
<p>If it is just the standard user account &gt; logon on to the admin account &gt; go to User Accounts application and change the standard account password to something you will remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is the admin account password that you have forgotten, then we are \not allowed to assist users to circumvent password protection.</p>

<h3> delraybuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            WordPad has taken over my computer,  icons and all&#33;</h2>
                    <p>In attempting to change default from unknown to a program that could open zip files,&nbsp; I tried using WordPad,&nbsp; since Windows 7 seems to have eliminated Windows Explorer as a default Program.&nbsp; I suddenly realized everything in my task bar,&nbsp; and almost all
 my programs were opening as WordPad,&nbsp; with what looked like Hieroglyphics for text!&nbsp; I ran sans and they came up no infections,&nbsp; and I'm wanting to do a System Restore to yesterday,&nbsp; but that,&nbsp; too,&nbsp; opens as WordPad! This zip file has caused me too many problems
 and I haven't been able to find out how to open it yet!&nbsp; At this point&nbsp; I'm afraid to do so,&nbsp; even though I had looked forward to receiving it.&nbsp; Even MSE opens as WordPad, as does everything else.&nbsp; I am able to open only a few sites by choosing links in Help!&nbsp;
 So can one of you brilliant technicians help me get out of this mess somehow?</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>Does the zip file contain a program, or just compressed files ? Generally if a zip file contains a malware</p>
<p>it does not infect your machine until you extract it or run an executable that installs it.
</p>
<p>- Notepad is generally the better option for opening unknown files to read text.
</p>
<p>A third party open source program, <em>Notepad ++</em> , is even better.</p>
<p>The Hieroglyphics would likely be machine code, not text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It is odd that all the file extensions seem to have changed to Wordpad. Perhaps the zip file
</p>
<p>contains a number of files with commonly used file extensions, and all of them have changed.</p>
<p>I'll waffle with what information I can offer anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try using the Boot Option - <em>Last Known Good Configuration</em></p>
<p>( Click Start &gt; Restart and after Windows shuts down but before it starts to reboot start tapping</p>
<p>the F8 key. This will display the Boot Options menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; If the Boot Options restore does not help you may need to do some registry entries.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to restore the default file extensions with a command prompt, or batch
</p>
<p>file but I wouldn't know how to do that. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/19449-default-file-type-associations-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">default-file-type-associations-restore</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Or - Maybe if you install 7-zip (below) you may be able to change the file association for the zip files</p>
<p>to 7-zip, and maybe the rest will come good as a result (I don't dare experiment) ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>- When you use the <em>Open</em> or <em>Open With</em> options you have to be careful to clear the tick box
</p>
<p>next to - '<em>Always use the selected program to open this kind of file'</em>.
</p>
<p>This will stop the Open With option from changing the File Association for all files that use this extension.
</p>
<p>( eg - .txt , .dll , ,exe ,&nbsp; and so on).</p>
<p>- Why MS made&nbsp;&nbsp; '<em>Always use the selected program to open this kind of file'</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; the default is a mystery</p>
<p>to me, as I very rarely want to change the file extension to always use a certain program, but there are a lot of things that will try to open, and which are legible with Notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------</p>
<p>I use 7-zip, which is a very popular for extracting and compressing files.</p>
<p>Download the&nbsp; msi version that suits your Win7 - 32 or 64bit. Run the msi to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">7-Zip</a> </p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>If&nbsp; you don't install 7-zip - (from Windows <em>Help and Support </em>in the Start menu ) -</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>- To extract a single file or folder, double-click the compressed folder to open it. Then,
</em><em>drag</em><em> the file or folder from the compressed folder to a new location.</em></p>
<p><em>- To extract the entire contents of the compressed folder, right-click the folder, click
</em><span><em>Extract All</em></span><em>, and then follow the instructions.</em></p>

            <p><span>Hi Andrew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community where you can find all the answers related to windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be due to the display drives got corrupted or settings with the monitor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In safe mode will have reduced functionality, but the task of isolating problems is easier because many non-core components are disabled even display drives.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software
 conflicts.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows:<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps from
<b>Step 3</b>: to reset computer as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot into normal mode successfully, then I would suggest you to
</span><span>Download and install the latest driver for display driver.<br />
<br />

            All that N version does is remove Windows Media Player which is still a great player and doesn't interfere if you don't want it.  Nor doe any of the other modern apps if you uninstall all of them that offer Uninstall buttons when you right click them in the All Apps menu in the Start Menu.  
<br />
<br />So what I'd do is uninstall all of them possible, delete the tiles you don't want and replace them with the ones you like (resizing to show more info if you value that in the Mail, News, Weather, Money, People and other Live Tiles.  
<br />
<br />Once you do that, take it from someone who also only likes a few of them - they won't bother you or interfere, and if they do let us know here and we will help you get rid of them.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Ahhhh ok, what Im wanting to do is get rid of everything except a web-browser, store and file explorer and install all the apps i prefer (iTunes, vlc. etc.) I want to say it would speed the laptop up (which is the main reason Im doing this) and the laptop
 is a Toshiba with a 250 GB hard drive and 2GB of ram.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill try uninstalling all that I can as soon as it lets me back in, (another reason, it takes around 30-45 minutes to log in then about the same time for windows explorer to load) it doesn't have any viruses at all, Ive taken it to a guy and he ran eset and
 avast and didn't find anything so its not that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know asap the apps are gone and if i ran into any trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            With 2gb RAM the thing to check first is if you can upgrade the RAM to 4gb which will double performance, not trim unusued features on the OS which are not actually problematic bloatware that hog resources.   
<br />
<br />Install this scanner to see what RAM upgrade your system can take and see some good prices for best quality RAM they offer:  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise what will check over to make sure you've got the system fully optimized is to go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Windows 10 Refresh which reinstalls Windows while leaving out the factory bloatware that throttles Windows and causes endless issues, and lets you save your files.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            Trust me, those apps aren't what's causing the slow performance, mate.
<br />
<br />Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />.

<p>2) I bought it with windows 8.1 then updated it to windows 10 tp (I had the computer enrolled as a insider device till January this year 2017 then I ran windows reset in the settings app)</p>
<p>3) Toshiba&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) It came with Norton and I removed it with their tools and asked them on how to remove all of the files (I dont have those emails and I dont have the email account i sent them with anymore so I cant pull them up)</p>
<p>5) ^^</p>
<p>6) It did a update a last July, ever since then it hasnt done a update to a new build. (The laptop takes forever to turn on then longer to log in then double as long to start windows explorer)</p>

            1. You were running an Insider Preview build when Win10 final was released on 29 July 2015, is that correct?
<br />
<br />2. Was an Insider Preview build installed when you did the Reset in January of 2017?
<br />
<br />3. Did you run the Norton Removal Tool before you installed your first Insider Preview build?
<br />
<br />=&gt; Note: Uninstalling the Norton application via Control Panel is NOT the same as running the Norton Removal Tool.
<br />
<br />4. REPOSTING =&gt; What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 stops working after 1 hour, what should I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I just upgraded my Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10, and everything seems to work fine until about after an hour; after said amount of time, Chrome will take a lot of time to close, the start menu will not show, and I can't open any apps. My computer
 runs with an Intel Core i3 M 350 @ 2.27 Ghz, with 4GB of RAM and running at x64 bits. If anyone could help me as soon as possible I'd be really thankful, as this problems gets really anoying. Thank you very much.

<h2>            Age of Empires 3</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, and before I start I want to apologise if this is the wrong place for my problem. I have never used xbox forums.</p>

<p>Alright, so in Christmas '07 I received Age of Empires 3 from my parents. (I loved AoE 2)</p>
<p>I had played it for a year or so and then got bored of it. It sat on a shelf for about 3-4 years.</p>

<p>Now, one of my friends bought the game and I wanted to play with him, however I can't install the game from the CD. It's unreadable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have the serial number and everything else, including the hard copy of the game, but I can't install it because of the CD. Is there ANY work around here?</p>

<p>I could supply my key to a Microsoft employee and they could check ANYWHERE on the internet or even the logs of when it was last played, it's been a few years.</p>

            <p>Hey there Crimson! For the most part, yea the key is the only real value, since the disks can be used for different installs. Your best bet here is to find someone with a CD copy of the game and use their disks (and your key) to install it. You could also try to contact the publisher. I've heard of them giving replacement CDs for like 5 or 10 bucks before. They might not do that anymore, but worth a shot.</p>

                    <p>DirectX does not work on my Windows 10 PC. &nbsp;This is a fresh install. &nbsp;That's the root of the problem, but in searching for a solution, I found several other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me why this link, direct from Microsoft, does not take me to the DirectX End-User Run-Time Web Installer as it is supposed to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=159853</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an old version online, in lieu of an official solution, but the installation fails, referring me to the DXError.log. &nbsp;It's not clear if this same problem would persist if I had an official version of the installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "/sfc scannow" from the command line, and it found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any solutions. &nbsp;Thanks!<br />

<h2>            White border around calendar gadget after installing IE9</h2>
                    Also having the same problem on 2 different computers. One running vista home premium 32bit and the other running vista HP 64 bit. Happened on both DIRECTLY AFTER installing IE9, and have talked to other people on Twitter with the same problem &amp; Google
 shows tons of people with the same problem, but havent seen any solutions yet.<br />
<br />
Something about your IE9 install caused this. <br />
<br />
If you drag the calendar off the sidebar, and put it back, that will fix the problem til next time you restart. But thats not an acceptable solution.<br />
<br />
I suspect this problem has happened to everyone, at least with vista. You guys really should fix it. Look forward to a real solution.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close all the gadgets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open an elevated Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to&nbsp;Start<b> </b>&gt; <b>All Programs</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click&nbsp;<b>Accessories.</b></p>
<p><span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click on&nbsp;Command<b> Prompt</b> and then click
<b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Command Prompt window, type the following commands one at a time and press ENTER:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>regsvr32 msxml3.dll</b></p>
<p><b>regsvr32 scrrun.dll</b></p>
<p><b>regsvr32 jscript.dll</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the registration&nbsp;was&nbsp;successful, you'll see the message&nbsp;<b>DllRegisterServer in&nbsp;<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> succeeded</b>&nbsp;for each command executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running the steps given above, check and see if the gadgets work fine.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2: </b>If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow
 the steps mentioned in the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><br />
If the issue persists, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> Uninstall and then reinstall Internet Explorer 9, refer the steps mentioned in the link below
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How do I install or uninstall Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;9?</b></p>

<br />
I have been through both Methods 1 &amp; 2 above, and both accomplished absolutely nothing whatsoever.&nbsp; Reregistering the DLLs succeeded, but had no effect.&nbsp; SFC detected no missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp; I do not wish to attempt Method 3 since I have a low-bandwidth
 connection and re-installing IE9 would take several hours and probably fail several times, and I cannot seem to find a standalone (offline) installer for IE9.&nbsp; If I uninstall IE9, it's staying off.&nbsp; Which would be a shame since it does seem to have some nice
 improvements over IE8.<br />
<br />
Like the original poster, I too find it extremely difficult to believe that this problem will not affect thousands if not millions of users, and I find it incomprehensible how a major corporation like Microsoft could fail to detect this issue during product
 testing prior to release.&nbsp; I can't help but wonder what other problems that aren't as obvious (but might be far more serious) Microsoft may have also failed to detect.&nbsp; &lt;soapbox&gt;There's simply no excuse for shoddy product testing, when there are thousands
 of testers in Silicon Valley looking for work.&lt;/soapbox&gt;<br />

            I don't think you need to consider re-installing IE9. &nbsp;I have exactly the same issues as you&nbsp;except&nbsp;that it applies to Windows 7. &nbsp;Also, I have the white border on both the Calendar and Weatherbug Gadgets.
<div><br />
<div>I originally&nbsp;installed&nbsp;IE9 Beta and got this white border immediately after installing it. &nbsp;About a week later I removed it (for other reasons). &nbsp;Immediately my white border problem&nbsp;disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the final release came along I reinstalled IE9 and back came the white borders on the&nbsp;Calendar&nbsp;and Weatherbug gagets.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried changing the Calendar (the one with an orange bar at the top) for another one that is called&nbsp;White&nbsp;Calendar and that one does not have the problem.. &nbsp;I reinstalled the one with e orange top and it has the problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So at the moment the White Calendar has no problems and is exactly the same type of calendar. &nbsp;The Weatherbug Gadget is still the same and I am just living with the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like you I cannot believe that there only a few sufferers of this problem, but it does seem to be specific just to some gadgets and not others. &nbsp;Does that make it a Gadget problem rather than an IE problem? &nbsp; I'm not sure, but possibly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Dave</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. I also re-registered the DLLs and ran the System File Checker but with no success.&nbsp;</div>

            Davidod1: thanks for the response.&nbsp; It's nice to know that it's not just Vista and not just me.<br />
<br />
The so-called "white border" we're all experiencing looks to me like an artifact of the drawing subroutine - it probably clears a white box before drawing anything else, then draws the calendar on top of it and forgets to make transparent the parts of the white
 box (i.e. the edges) that don't fit inside the calendar.&nbsp; It will probably affect only gadgets (and apps?) that use that particular drawing method.&nbsp; At this point, I hope this issue will be fixed in a future release.<br />
<br />
I'm trying a few experiments with various IE and Windows settings - if any of them have any significant effect, I'll pass them along here.<br />
<br />
Is <a href="http://petermac.deviantart.com/art/White-Calendar-65560873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> the "White Calendar" you referred to?&nbsp; If so, I'll try it out and see what happens.<br />
<br />
I still cannot imagine how an issue like this (however harmless, but extremely obvious cosmetically) could possibly escape the notice of anyone using this gadget on a machine running IE9.&nbsp; It would be interesting to know if there is anyone out there anywhere
 who is running the standard Windows sidebar with this gadget and who has IE9 installed who is NOT experiencing this problem.<br />

            Addendum to above post:<br />
<br />
I've now tried the <a href="http://petermac.deviantart.com/art/White-Calendar-65560873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
White Calendar</a> I found above, along with a similar <a href="http://rapha2.deviantart.com/art/Blue-Microsoft-Calendar-Gadget-64922845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Blue Calendar</a>.&nbsp; Both of them are clearly based on the same code as the original Windows gadget, and behave exactly the same - they both show the white edge as well.&nbsp; Perhaps it simply isn't as noticeable with the White Calendar.<br />
<br />
Davidod1: if this isn't the same "White Calendar" you referred to, I'd like to see the one you mean.<br />

            Just to confirm for Beerslayer2000 that White&nbsp;Calendar with link above has worked for me without any border at all - just as per the original orange one before installing IE9. &nbsp;I did in fact re-install the original Orange Calendar immediately under the
 white one and it still has the border while the white one (from the above link) does not have any border.

            Hey, Microsoft - you still out there?<br />
<br />
This problem is **NOT** resolved.<br />
<br />
I just updated my sister's Vista 64-bit PC to IE 9 and got the same damned problem.<br />
<br />
So far as I can tell, this problem will happen to anyone running Vista (both 32-bit and 64-bit) with the default Calendar gadget in the Sidebar who installs IE 9 on the computer.&nbsp; There must be millions of users out there experiencing this problem, which makes
 a mockery out of Microsoft's quality assurance.<br />
<br />
I cannot believe that a company like Microsoft which supposedly cares about its image would allow a cosmetic but extremely widespread and very obvious bug like this to continue to exist, seven full months after this report.&nbsp; This has to be a one-line tweak
 in a source file somewhere to fix.&nbsp; In the words of the Cable Guy: Get 'er done!<br />

            Hmmm... never seen this one before.&nbsp; I'll give it a shot.&nbsp; Thanks, Dave.<br />
<br />
That doesn't change my disdain for Microsoft allowing such an obvious cosmetic bug to exist unchecked.&nbsp; It leaves me wondering what else they're ignoring.<br />
<br />
Ubuntu, anyone?<br />

<p>Try restarting your console, router, and modem. Sometimes there is an error in your networking devices that does not allow you to connect to multiplayer games and chat.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It may also be a NAT error. NAT is a setting on routers that needs to be set to "open" for the optimal online experience. It's pretty confusing, so I will let you look over the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NAT troubleshooting page here</a> for the fastest troubleshooting experience.</p>

<p>Good luck, and be sure to post back if this didn't resolve your problem.</p>

<p>Hey there Spizzy,<br />
<br />
You may want to try this for<strong> DCHP Reservation</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a web browser. </li><li>Log into the router by entering the default gateway (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/networking-hardware/02-routers/airlink/f/3451/p/2262594/editpost.aspx/192.168.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">192.168.2.1</a>) into the address bar of the
 internet browser. </li><li>The router will then prompt for a user name and password. The default is that user name is&nbsp;"admin" and the password is "admin".
</li><li>From the menu on the left, click on Network. </li><li>From the submenu, click on LAN. </li><li>Check the box that says “Enable Static DHCP” </li><li>Enter in the MAC address and the IP address of the xbox in the two boxes available.
</li><li>Click Add. </li><li>Click Apply. </li></ol>
<p><br />
<strong>Keep in mind</strong>, enabling DCHP will make it so no other devices will connect to your network.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>If you are still having issues</strong>, a few things that can help us narrow this down:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Modem brand &amp; model number:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Router brand &amp; model number:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Network Connection Type: Wireless/Wired:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Things you have tried:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is NAT Type Open?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any Error Codes you encounter:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen? :</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

</strong>Let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.</p>

Okay. That looks like a UPnP error.<br />

Try this:</p>

</li><li>When prompted leave&nbsp;user name blank&nbsp;and use&nbsp;"admin" for the password. </li><li>Select Administration from the menu at the top. </li><li>In Administration toggle UPnP. </li></ol>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What is the make/model of &nbsp;modem that the Linksys is connected to? Are you using Xplornet 4g or Satellite service</p>
<p>When you look at the WAN/Internet ip address on the Linksys router does it start with 10 or 172 or 192? It is the WAN/Internet ip address on the router you need to look at, not the LAN address</p>

<p>If the WAN/Internet ip address on the router starts with 192 that is the issue, have a look at this:-
<a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/component/content/article/23-broadband/connecting-to-broadband/199-broadband-providers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/.../199-broadband-providers</a></p>
<p>Your ISP is using private ip addressing, so they are already NAT'ing then your router is NAT'ing again which is preventing you from matchmaking etc</p>
<p>Contact your ISP and ask if they can supply you with a public ip address instead, if they can't you are pretty much stuck really unless you can use a different ISP :|</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Have you tried with removing and reinstall your wireless adapter?
<br />To do so:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Network card"
<br />4. Right click on your wireless adapter
<br />5. Click on "Uninstall Device"
<br />6. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon)
<br />
<br />Also, have you checked your manufacturer site if there is a BIOS Update?       
        </p>

            Hi Sarod, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Since you've already tried reinstalling and updating your wireless adapters, you could try resetting your power plan settings to default to see if the problem goes away. Here is an article with instructions for this:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/43774-reset-restore-power-plans-default-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/43774-reset...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also try manually adjusting your power plan settings relating to your wireless adapter:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "power plan"
<br />- Select "Edit power plan"
<br />- In the window that appears, click "change advanced power settings"
<br />- Try changing the settings under "Wireless Adapter Settings" to see if different settings here makes a difference.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

<br />Indeed your WiFi card is causing the crash. It might be possible that your WiFi card is defective and you need to replace it. Have you asked Dell about this?

            New year and Christmas greetings to you too :)
<br />
<br /> We also don't have a tool to determine this as this thing is bundled into the motherboard. This is also not a thing like where we can check it on another computer. This is the reason why I suggested to ask Dell as they know their hardware better.

            Ok, then I suggest you to perform a scan and repair of filesystem: 
<br />
<br />1. Digit "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Digit "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />Then : 
<br />
<br />1. Digit "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Digit "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />5. Digit "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />6. Digit "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />You can perform a clean boot:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The issue may be a driver conflict.
<br />
<br />Can you temporarily uninstall Malwarebytes and see if the issue resolves.
<br />
<br />If the error persists can you provide the following file which has more information on the crash:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP
<br />
<br />The memory.dmp file will be quite large, you could zip and compress the memory.dmp file with a third party application such as 7-Zip.

            The reason why you probably got that error is because office 365 probably doesn't&nbsp; supporrt windows8.1. The only way to solve this problem is to probably run it in compatibility&nbsp; mode.<br />

            <p>Although I'm unable to provide a solution, I can attest to the fact that Office 365 does run work in 8.0 and 8.1, I currently have it installed on three systems that were upgraded from 8.0 to 8.1 and has worked perfectly on all three. I don't use Publisher,
 but used Word, Excel and Access extensively.</p>

                    Hi,&nbsp; I have an HP Pavilion dv7 running Windows 7.&nbsp; It is less than 6 months old, so shouldn't be having any problems.&nbsp; For some reason I am able to open non-Microsoft programs (i.e. Audacity, Skype, Itunes, HP games, etc.), which run perfectly once opened,
 but cannot open anything Microsoft (i.e. internet explorer, Microsoft Office, many of the control panel options, etc.).&nbsp; Internet Explorer acts like it will open but then doesn't; Outlook opens then closes immediately; Word, Excel, etc.&nbsp; open, several errors
 pop up, and it immediately closes.&nbsp; I have no idea what to do.&nbsp; I managed to get a download of Mozilla Firefox to install on my computer to get on the internet, which is what I am using right now, which works perfectly as well.&nbsp; To make matters worse,&nbsp; I have
 scanned for viruses and malware with Microsoft Security Essentials (which also stopped working) and Kaskerpy, both of which claimed that the computer was clean.&nbsp; Also, I tried

            Tried the SubInACL, but it didnt do anything.&nbsp; Could not download the other programs because of Microsoft (kept saying errors with class not registered).&nbsp; Didn't seem like the first part about the security settings would help much.&nbsp; Spoke to HP since Microsoft
 wants to charge me to find out why their operating system is dysfunctional.&nbsp; Representative at HP said he had never heard of this happening before and was going to contact Microsoft for answers.&nbsp; Do you maybe have any other options short of reinstalling Windows?

<p>One thing that might be worth trying is to uninstall (not just disable)&nbsp;all your security programs such as Kapersky and MSE, and any other third party security programs that you may be running?&nbsp; Reinstall only one anti virus program otherwise they may cause
 instability if running more than one together.</p>
<p>If you do a reinstall then maybe you can make use of these.</p>

<h2>            &#34;You may be a victim of software counterfeiting&#34; - MGADiag report results &#47; need help</h2>
                    I saw this response on another thread with the same question:<br />
<br />
"Please post an MGADiag report.
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop -
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please"<br />
<br />
I followed the above instructions and here is what I got [pasted below]; can someone please help me? And for more info on my computer -- it was a FLOOR MODEL that was being used as a display / example. I purchased it at a discounted price. I do not remember
 getting a Windows 7 disk with it? I have a little sticker on the computer that says, "Windows 7" (there are other stickers too, but that one seems to be the only relevant one to the problem at hand).<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time / help.<br />

<p>Windows will not update fully.&nbsp; I always receive this error: "WindowsUpdate_80070246" "WindowsUpdate_dt000"</p>

<h2>            Reporting bugs &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Why is sending bug report for Windows 10 so difficult?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While copying files from one drive to another (both perfect drive) the copy process hung...
</p>
<p>It just sat there just looking at me... no notification... no popups... nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched for information on posting a bug report / feedback, I was greeted with a lot of useless links containing more useless links... I don't have time for this so I decided to ask the question and indirectly identify the problem...</p>
