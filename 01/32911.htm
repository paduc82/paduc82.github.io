    <title>Trilogy Discussion Group&#58; Alternate Squadmates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trilogy Discussion Group&#58; Alternate Squadmates</h2>
                    
<p>Here's a scenario. You are allowed to swap out any two <em>Mass Effect 3</em> squadmates and instead replace them with any of these candidates. These individuals would be full teammates with dialogue, their own power suites, banter with other teammates,
 and would be available on the Normandy for conversations. All of these individuals have never been squadmates before but have been present in the trilogy up to this point. and all of them could either die or survive in the previous games based on the player's
 actions. The point of this exercise are characters that would feel compelled to join based Shep making a difference in their lives, but that they do not have obligations elsewhere. Hence, Feron doesn't qualify because Shep
<em>always</em> saves him, and neither does Kirrahe, as even if he is alive, he is fiercely loyal to the Salarian STG and wouldn't abandon the soldiers under him to join Shepard. It's about how the trilogy could play itself out differently based on Shep's actions.<br />
<br />
A few caveats to start with. </p>
<ol>
<li>If you replace a <em>Mass Effect 3</em> squadmate that is plot essential, they would still appear in the game for the narrative, just not as a squadmate. For example,if you choose to replace Liara, she would still travel with you on the Normandy as the
 Shadow Broker but would not accompany you on missions. If you chose to replace EDI, EDI would still be part of the Normandy and would interact with Joker and the crew, but again, not accompany you on missions.
</li><li>The candidate must have survived their respective <em>Mass Effect </em>or <em>
Mass Effect 2</em> storyline. If none of these candidates survived into <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, your team would simply be down two members without a replacement.
</li><li>You can only choose <em>two</em> of them, and you must replace someone from <em>
Mass Effect 3</em> if you do. </li><li>Please don't suggest characters not on this list. </li></ol>
<p><br />
<strong>CORPORAL TOOMBS: </strong>Human. Survived Thresher Maw attack on Akuze, possible former teammate of a Sole Survivor Shepard. Captured and experimented upon by Cerberus.<br />
<br />
Must have completed UNC: Dead Scientists in <em>Mass Effect </em>with Toombs surviving it. Could be recruited after Grissom Academy when Shepard has proven to him that she/he is not working with Cerberus. Toombs would be an Infiltrator with Sniper Rifle and
 Sub-Machine guns. Toombs would have extra dialogue and storyline if brought along on the Cerberus Coup, Sanctuary, Ex-Cerberus Scientists, and Cronos Station missions.<br />
<br />
<strong>SHIALA</strong>: Asari. Former acolyte of Matriarch Benezia. Provided Shepard the Prothean Cipher on Feros.<br />
<br />
Must have survived Feros: The Thorian in <em>Mass Effect </em>and Illium: Medical Scans in
<em>Mass Effect 2</em> must have been completed. Could be recruited on the Citadel after Priority: Mars. Shiala would be an Asari Commando with a biotic suite of powers that would be a mix of Liara and Aria's abilities. Her weapons would be **** Rifles and
 Heavy Pistols. She would have additional dialogue and storyline if brought along on Priority: Eden Prime, Thessia, Ardat-Yakshi Monastery, and Leviathan. Possible romance available for both a male and a female Shepard.<br />
<br />
<strong>BATARIAN PLAGUE VICTIM</strong>: Batarian. Distrustful of Shepard when met on Omega. Says he misjudged humanity if brought to Mordin's clinic.<br />
<br />
Must have used Paragon interrupt to keep him alive and requested someone from the clinic aid him during Dossier: The Professor in
<em>Mass Effect 2</em>. Could be recruited on the Citadel after Priority Mars. Feeling both a debt of gratitude to Shepard for saving his life, and anger at the Reaper destruction of Khar'shan, would like to join the Normandy's crew. He would had a fully fleshed
 out backstory and name. His class would be Engineer-based, with tech attacks, decoy, and sabotage, but no drones or defense matrix. His weapons would be Shotguns and Heavy Pistols. He would have extra dialogue and storyline if brought along on Leviathan, Sur'Kesh,
 and Tuchanka., with additional scenes on the Normandy with either Mordin or Padok Wiks.<br />
<br />
<strong>URDNOT DARG</strong>: Krogan. Scout that went missing and captured by Clan Weryloc. Can be persuaded to escape by Shepard.<br />
<br />
Must have found him and convinced him to leave the Weyrloc hospital during Mordin: Old Blood in
<em>Mass Effect 2</em>. Could be recruited after Priority: Sur'Kesh. Grateful to Shepard for helping to save him. His class would be a mix of Infiltrator and Sentinel: tech armor and an assassination power similar to Kasumi's in
<em>Mass Effect 2</em>. His weapons would be Shotguns and **** Rifles. Would have extra dialogue and storyline if&nbsp; brought along during Attican Traverse: Krogan Team, Priority: Tuchanka, and he'd have some interesting things to say during the Sanctuary Mission.<br />
<br />
<strong>LANTAR SIDONIS</strong>: Turian. Part of the original Archangel crew on Omega. Remorseful of his betrayal of that team.<br />
<br />
Must have survived Garrus: An Eye For An Eye in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. Seeking redemption for his actions on Omega. Could be recruited during Priority Palaven. If Garrus has survived, there will be significant interplay between the two of them, especially
 if Garrus is also available as a squad member. Could be recruited on the Citadel after Priority Palaven. He would be a drone-based Engineer, with all three drone types (turret, defensive, and attack). His weapons are Sub-Machine Guns and Heavy Pistols. Would
 have extra dialogue and storyline during both the Turian Platoon and Tuchanka Bomb missions, and he would play a part in the missions Aria sends you on to recruit the surviving Omega merc groups (not always for the better).<br />

Well, no, not for the purposes of this discussion.<br />
<br />
As a potential counterpoint to this, Shiala's email never says it is her proximity to the other Thorian survivors that blocks the Reaper indoctrination, merely their shared connection.
<br />
<br />
<em>"I'm sure I'm still indoctrinated. I remember Sovereign's voice in my mind when I went willingly to the Thorian as its thrall. But my connection to the people of Zhu's Hope is stronger. It drowns out the Reaper voices."<br />
<br />
</em>Her conversation in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> only mentions proximity to other colonists as being necessary to feel shared sensations like pain.<em><br />
<br />
</em>Is proximity to the other colonists necessary to counteract the Indoctrination? It's never said. And for the purposes of this discussion, it wouldn't be necessary.<br />
<br />
She'd mention her concern in her conversations: talk about how she'd be worried about potential complications if she becomes the only survivor if the rest of the colonists are killed, but the story wouldn't have a scenario where she turns on you or kills the
 team.<em><br />

<p>I'd recruit Shiala in a heartbeat, indoctrinated or not, without starting another 'Indoctrination Theory' argument, I believe that BOTH Shiala &amp; Shepard are "indoctrinated" and pose no risk to "infecting" the crew for they've both shown remarkable mental
 agility to be able to carry the Cypher without losing themselves in the process. &nbsp;They are two very unique beings who share a very "unique" experience between them and working together for the common good could only strengthen the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Batarian Plague Victim would be my second choice, if not for the sole reason that we never had a Batarian squadmate join the crew before.&nbsp; If recruiting both of these choices means dispensing with two others, it'd be Garrus &amp; Ashley for me because I
 don't see how their absence would prevent the completion of the mission.&nbsp; The Batarian would also&nbsp;provide an opportunity for the&nbsp;crew and Shepard to teach someone from a different culture, who's&nbsp;been traditionally&nbsp;indifferent (to say the least) of&nbsp;Humans&nbsp;&amp;
 other races&nbsp;in the past, that working together&nbsp;for a better tomorrow is an important aspect of any species' evolution...:-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>What about when you run into Shiala on Illium?&nbsp; She appears to have a pretty good hold on herself and it's probably the most "sensible" appearance by her in the series, not to mention the sheer distance that she now is from the Feros Colonists when you see
 her.&nbsp; She removed herself "from that environment" and would've had to have traveled a great distance&nbsp;to Illium and&nbsp;there's no evidence to suggest that she wasn't able to control her indoctrinated consciousness during that time, yet there's enough&nbsp;here to assume
 that she's no longer a threat...:-)</p>

Re: Death's Head comments. I should clarify that I personally don't want to drop my ME3 team. I'm just doing this as an exercise to see how the teams could be built differently if optional recruiting came into play.<br />
<br />
For myself.<br />
<br />
I would add:<br />
<br />
SHIALA - I'd like to see her interactions with Javik, and I imagine taking her along to Eden Prime when recruiting him would be a fun time.<br />
<br />
SIDONIS - I think the interplay with Garrus would be a blast, in addition to having spared his life pay off in some appreciable sense instead of just being a footnote on a Citadel News Net feature.
<br />
<br />
I would lose:<br />
<br />
EDI - She'd still be part of the story, and I think she's more interesting as the Normandy AI instead of a mobile platform shaped like a supermodel.<br />
<br />
TALI - She'd be part of the Quarian storyline as much as she is now minus the squadmate bits. However, she'd stay with the Quarians after Rannoch. She'd make another appearance at the end of the game as the Quarian representative at the forward base.</p>

<p>[quote user="Arkham99"]What about when you run into Shiala on Illium?[/quote]In Mass Effect 2 the Reapers aren't in our Galaxy.<br />
<br />
Just look at Rana Thanoptis, the Asari researcher from Virmire. As far as we know she never had direct contact with Sovereign but yet became indoctrinated simply by researching its signal, and once the Reapers arrived in our Galaxy she came under their control.
 Yet until that point she was 'free'.<br />
<br />
Shiala was on Sovereign, direct at the source as it were, it would be near insanity to take her with you when you are in contact with not only Reaper forces but on occasion Reapers themselves.</p>

 my keyboard and mouse on my laptop and they work perfectly fine. They even are on and working within the first 10 seconds of startup. Nothing dramatic has changed before this issue started. I've tried booting up with the USB stick and it works for a second
 before going back to the Windows 10 loading screen before it says "We ran into a problem. We will restart your PC for you." The loop starts all over.</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error such as "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart" is sometimes caused by conflicting drivers, faulty hardware, or corrupted system files. Now, if you can't boot your PC normally, try turning it off by pressing the power button until it's completely
 off. After that, turn on your PC and check if it will boot normally. If it does, then you can run the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker utility</a></strong> to determine if there are irregularities on the
 system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC won't boot normally and it's still getting the same error, then perform a
<strong>System Restore</strong>. To do that, please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Won&#39;t boot to desktop- Boot ups always come with &#39;no input signal&#39; for monitor</h2>
                    <p><span>Thanks for looking into this issue. &nbsp;So, first, it would boot up after a few attempts ultimately going to blue screen error in approx. 5 min. I booted this way repeatedly only in 'safe mode with networking 'to try the many repair suggestions for two
 days now. At this point, it just freezes at 'windows is loading files' but will likely go to blue screen error. Boot ups always come with 'no input signal' for monitor and switching the input signal in menu helps for the 5 min periods I mentioned and then
 fails or 'monitor going to sleep' occurs. <br />
<br />
The error messages rec'vd: corrupt image, corrupt file and file header check sum does not match computer check sum. Blue screen recommendations: disable BIOS memory, any current hardware or drivers and check disc space.
<br />
<br />
Some attempts to fix: memory diagnostics and it showed 'no problems', checked monitor on another computer and it works, during one 5 min session a 'fix it' download from Microsoft via a thumb drive listed problem as 'windows search crashes' but was 'unable
 to fix', some other attempts would show the 'windows installer has stopped working' preventing any actions.
<br />
<br />
At present, am unable to boot even with advanced options at F8. &nbsp;It's HP Pavilion 10/2007, with HP assistance. Its on a wireless network with a netbook, Blu-ray occasionally a cellular telephone that runs windows live but none show as a device</span>.</p>

<p>Hi Yogesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is most likely caused by the .dll files being blocked by a program like antivirus software. It may not be enough to just disable your antivirus software. Please add the .dll files to the exceptions list of your antivirus software just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

    <title>Entire side of touchscreen no longer responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e.robles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entire side of touchscreen no longer responding</h2>
                    <p>Up until today, my Surface RT had been working fine. Today when I tried to use it, however, the Charm Bar wouldn't appear after swiping from the right. I've spent most of today restarting, refreshing, and all over trying to get the charms and calibration
 to work. It was only until I tinkered with the orientation (I never use it portrait style) that I realized it's not the Charm bar itself that's not working - it's the entire right side of the device. Thus, if the orientation is portrait, I cannot swipe "down"
 and close the app (or, if oriented differently, can't swipe "up" for the options), so on and so forth. Is there any way to solve this? I have no idea what could possibly be messing with the screen so badly that an entire section would blackout this way. It
 has a few minor scratches and a small crack, but on the left side of the device, not anywhere near the side that it's currently malfunctioning on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this? I've tried pretty much everything the troubleshooter on this page suggests.</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The only time the Charm Bar (or rather, the right side of the device) responded was literally right after restarting and unlocking the device - a few swipes and then it would finally show the Charm Bar, but that would be it. It would only work once
 (after much nudging) and then resume to being unresponsive.</p>

            <p><span>Hi E.Robles,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting and posting in the Microsoft Community. I am sorry to hear the right side of the touch screen on your Surface RT is not working or responding properly. I
 can see how this is concerning to you, especially when it happened so suddenly. We will be glad to assist and guide you towards a viable solution!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, please make sure that all and latest
<strong>Windows Updates </strong>are installed, this is very important!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, you can also try to
<strong><em>update or/and uninstall and reinstall&nbsp;the Touch drivers</em></strong>. Here is how:</span></p>

<strong>Next</strong></span></li><li><span>Let the install finish.</span></li><li><span>Restart your Surface.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 27pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If after the previous steps&nbsp;the issue persists, repeat the steps from
<strong>1-6</strong> and click<strong> Uninstall</strong>, then restart your Surface and allow Windows to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>***Please&nbsp;DO NOT&nbsp;check the box&nbsp;saying "Delete the driver software for this device".***</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note, if none of the above steps work, a
<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/refresh-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Refresh
</a></strong>would be the next step, however, you mention having done this as well. For this reason, if after trying the steps above, including a

    <title>USB drive letter assignments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don camp  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB drive letter assignments</h2>
                    <p>Long-winded background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have a USB flash drive that I assigned to drive D: in Disk Management.&nbsp; Occasionally when I'm not thinking, I plug it in when another external drive is connected and already assigned D: by Windows. The flash drive then gets reassigned as E:. I know I
 can switch it back to D: in Disk Management, but frankly my original reason for assigning a fixed letter is not such a big deal anymore. Is there a way to "undo" fixed letter assignments? I'd like to just let the drive float again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Once you assign a fixed drive letter in Disk Management, is there a way to "undo" and let the drive assignment float again?</p>

            Hi Oon, this can be done in the Windows Registry . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Plug in that device and unplug all other USB drives . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices
<br />
<br />On the right, scroll down to the bottom
<br />
<br />Right click the appropriate Key and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and unplug the USB drive
<br />
<br />That's It

<h2>            Computer Enters blue screen with error system_service_exception and it says the cause is asmtxhci.sys</h2>
                    <p>So every time I leave my computer alone for maybe 2 minutes it will crash with that error code. It doesn't seem to do it when I am using it, but rather only when I'm idle. I have tried booting windows without any services running and that didn't help. I
 have gone in to windows logs and found a bunch of errors I will list them all here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CldFlt service failed to start due to the following error:&nbsp;<br />
The request is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device ROOT\WPD\0000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dump file creation failed due to error during dump creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x0000003b (0x00000000c0000005, 0xfffff80276f0ce97, 0xffffc30008bfecd0, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: c9c487bb-dbf6-4643-981a-b39fb276f930</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW here's a link to view those dump files in the above error:&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/esnyqcsopatdk06/Desktop.rar?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous system shutdown at 10:48:25 PM on ‎7/‎13/‎2017 was unexpected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom0 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After looking through the logs I found a lot of the above errors to be repeated multiple times, especially the top one. Any help from anyone will be very appreciated.</p>
<p>

            The issues started a few weeks ago. I have the program Driver Booster installed and found that it wasn't long after updating my drivers with this program that the blue screen started. I will follow the steps you have told me to take and report back after
 doing that.

<h2>            How to install my windows 10 on a new computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this might sound silly... when I bought my desktop computer, I bought windows 10 with it. I received my computer with windows installed and the product key sticker slapped onto the side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If memory serves, I didn't get a CD, and was told I would only need the product key in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is as follows: next year I'm going to buy a new desktop computer. How will I be able to install windows 10 on it, if I don't have the disk, only the product key...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Owlyz, that will be no problem, you can download and create the latest Windows 10 installation media at any time and it will cost you nothing and activation will be automatic . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool       
        </p>

            Hi Owlyz,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You don't require a CD of Windows 10. That era is gone. You need to download Windows 10 now. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Audio stops working after opening certain software or just randomly watching videos</h2>
                    <p>This has been going on since the first day I installed Windows 10, I think, every time I open the Telegram app and (sometimes) Counter Strike: Global Offensive, audio crashes and I have to restart the computer, if I want to use Telegram it's necessary to
 open it the moment I turn on my PC with no audio playing, if I try to test the device it runs into a problem and says can't do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, however, audio has started to randomly stop working while watching videos on Youtube, when trying to test it says that another software is using the playback device and that I have to wait for it to finish, but to my knowledge no other software
 is playing audio (this is without CS:GO and Telegram running).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases troubleshoot doesn't find any issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after restarting the volume icon on the taskbar disappears and it's not available to reactivate on the customize screen.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>after remove threats with MalwareBytes, still has a china advertisement message pop up</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems can not remove malware</p>
<p>
</p><p>then i suspect chrome local TCP port too much , then i set allow chrome TCP local port to 65530 - 65535</p>
<p>
</p><p>i expect chrome only use port 65530 to 65535 but no local port use this range, more worse is that blocking port&nbsp;</p>
<p>is using by unknown process</p>

            <p>there are a number of reasons why some updates don't install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes, it's basically due to&nbsp;being in-compatible, although the microsoft update servers thought it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is the update a special one designed for your specific hardware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if so, then maybe the computer maker has a fix or similar update for your computer.</p>

<p>Normally when a subscription goes past due it will not allow you to use the payment option that was originally tried to use to pay for it and you would need to use a different payment option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to account.microsoft.com and add a new payment option and use that to pay the past due amount.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I keep getting message&#58; &#34;the requested operation requires elevation&#34; on a program that worked on Windows 8 before windows 10 update</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 and really like it, but my Rosetta Stone (Tagalog Version 2) program wouldn't work after the upgrade. It worked perfectly fine with Windows 8.1. I kept getting&nbsp;a message saying I need to login as an administrator and try again.
 I AM an administrator so this confused me. I tried right clicking "run as administrator" and tried changing the compatibility settings but still no success. I've tried reinstalling the software, and even tried reinstalling Windows 10! Now when I try running
 the program&nbsp;I get the message "Error executing file. C:\ProgramData\Rosetta Stone\RS2.2.0.0A\Rosetta Stone.exe The requested operation requires elevation. I'm not sure what to do to get this up and running again!!!

<h2>            Win 8.1&#58; Bluetooth does not come out of Connected Standby</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2, recently upgraded from Win8 Pro to Win 8.1. Since the upgrade, Bluetooth has been failing to come out of connected standby. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>When coming out of Standby, Bluetooth is FUBAR.</span>
</li><li><span>Happens when in standby longer than 10 secs. If less than this it still works when it comes out of standby.</span>
</li><li><span>Tray icon &gt; Bluetooth icon &gt; Show Bluetooth devices results in blue cog screen then white screen which results in a crash to Start screen.</span>
</li><li><span>Event Viewer indicates that bthmini did not respond within the required timeout.</span>
</li><li><span>Tray icon &gt; Bluetooth icon &gt; Open Settings: COM 3 and 4 are listed before a crash is instigated.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Post crash, the settings<span>&nbsp;
</span>&gt; COM Ports hangs and does not show any COM ports listed.</span> </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The result is that Bluetooth devices (specifically a MS Wedge keyboard) will not reconnect after coming out of standby. They connect fine from
 a cold boot.&nbsp; Needless to say this is infuriating.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I've been struggling to find any specific fault with the BT adapter. The Bluetooth drivers&nbsp;remain listed in Device Manager and say they are
 operating correctly, though clearly they aren't. However, I think it's a driver issue, though I have the latest from Lenovo (Broadcom) installed. The only "smoking gun" I have been able to find is the log from the settings app crashing, which indicates the
 timeout I mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone help? Thanks....</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The following log shows what happens when, after coming out of standby, you do Bluetooth tray icon &gt; Show Bluetooth devices and the settings
 app crashes:</span></p>

            Further information on this problem. <br />
<br />
After coming out of standby and bluetooth not responsing, going to Administrative Tools &gt; Services lets me see "Bluetooth Support Service" which has a status of "Running".<br />
<br />
If I try to restart that service, the restart process tries for a while then hangs. The list of services now shows the Bluetooth Support Service as "Stopping". Right clicking on it shows the "Stop Pause Restart options greyed out but I can click "Start".<br />
<br />
On clicking "Start, Service Control says "Windows is attempting to start the following service on Local Computer - Bluetooth Support Service" and the green bar progresses along for a few minutes before the dialog box disappears and the status says "Running".
 However the problem is still there - no BT connectivity. Very strange. A further attempt to restart has the same results as previously i.e. the restart hangs.<br />
<br />
During the service restart attempts, the Event Viewer shows warnings "A command was sent to the adapter has timed out. The adapter did not respond" with a source of BthMini which I'm guessing is the Bluetooth adapter.<br />
<br />
Aaagghh!<br />

            <p>It's pretty clear that the BT/USB stack was trashed by Windows 8.x. My guess is the device manufacturers haven't been able to clearly vet their drivers and nothing runs clean anymore. This is a seriously rampant problem that either Microsoft or the device
 manufacturers have to step up and address once and for all. My only concern is they won't. Leaving us to own wares.&nbsp;That said...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I've seen that fixes Bluetooth devices crashing are:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. In Device Manager, disabling and re-enabling the USB stack that the Bluetooth devices are connected to. I have no idea why they are connected, but it works for my ultra-horrible tablet. I've never been able to disable or enable a Bluetooth/Network Adapter
 and get the same result. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Swipe across the right part of the screen to get the charms menu, choose Settings, Change PC Settings, PC and Devices, Bluetooth. When I lose my Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse and Keyboard connection, I go to this view and I see that almost always reconnect.
 I have no clue why navigating to a Metro-view resets the connection, but it does for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Update your drivers from Lenovo, or the USB/Bluetooth manufacturer. My stack runs on Intel and they had an update from 2011 that improved my situation, but didn't fix it. Intel does have a driver from 2013, but it only supports desktop chipsets. Again
 leaving me to believe they are going to sweep this issue under the rug expecting us to just to buy new hardware.</p>
