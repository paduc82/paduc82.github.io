<p>You don't want to install the Win98. It sounds like you are trying to do this and most Win98 discs aren't bootable anyway. Start the installation with the XP CD and you will be prompted to insert qualifying media. Put your Win98 CD in the drive.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I have followed your instructions&nbsp;&nbsp; I start with inserting WIN XP SP2,&nbsp; Then receive,&nbsp; "please insert one of the following product CD's"&nbsp; I insert WIN 98SE,&nbsp; and receive a message&nbsp;&nbsp;( unknown disc, there is no disk in this drive)&nbsp;
 If i press enter to force the install,&nbsp;I receive a message, (Technical information: stop:0x000008E (0xc0000005,)xF763CCFD, 0xf722F800, Ox00000000, setupdd.sys - address F763CCFD base at F7613000, datestamp 3d6dd67f).</p>
<p>I think the problem maybe that the WIN98SE CD that I purchased was an upgrade from WIN95. 3.5 floppy.&nbsp; Way back when? &nbsp;I purchased WIN3.1, then upgraded to WIN95, then upgraded to WIN98, then&nbsp;WIN98 SE, then millenium, then XP SP1, then purchased XP SP2,
 downloaded service pack three.&nbsp;&nbsp;The WIN98SE CD that I am useing is clean and is running in the drive but I continue to receive the error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if 98 isn't recognized because it is an upgrade product?&nbsp; In addition I have the product keys for both
 WIN 98 and WIN XP.&nbsp; I can' tbelieve that microsoft would require product keys going back 15 years?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I suspect that the Win98 disc is no good rather than that it is an upgrade but that's just a guess. Or maybe your CD drive is marginal. Try a different CD drive.

<br />
By default, users can change which programs should be used to open a file with a specific extension. Since you can't, something has changed on your PC. Did you perhaps install some registry "cleaner" or performance "booster"? If so then it might have modified
 some registry location with some unexpected side effects. I would try this:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>See if you can make the change while in Safe Mode.</li><li>Create a new admin account, then try again.</li><li>Use console commands such as assoc and associate.exe (to be copied from a WinXP machine) to set the desired association.<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
Anyway, what is the association at the moment? If it is something other than WSH, how did you change it?<br />
<br />
On a different subject: When you declare "i am admin, there is no other account on my pc" then you basically say that you have just one key to your house and that you do not care if you are left standing in the rain in case you've lost your key. This is a FAQ
 question in this forum: "My admin password no longer works / I forgot it / someone changed it / etc etc - what now?". Lots of risk takers out there, yet creating, testing and documenting a spare admin account would be so easy . . .<br />

- What is the association for .vbs files right now?<br />
- If it is something other than WSH, how did you change it?<br />

            Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D. Run SFC Scan &amp; DISM
<br />How to - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc609315-d...</a>
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, kindly provide information on below questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12194/what-version-of-skype-am-i-using-on-my-mobile-or-tablet?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype version </a>and OS version installed on your device?</p>
<p>2. Have you check if you have turned on Skype notifications from your device settings? Settings are managed differently depending on the device. If you‚Äôre not sure how to check your device settings, you may need to check the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</p>
<p>3. Have you check if you have turned on notifications for a specific chat?</p>
<p>4. Have you tested Push Notifications fro your device? On <strong>Android</strong>: From
<strong>Settings</strong>, tap <strong>Test Push Notifications</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            I've tried every single way on web and i got same problem. Also i log in with my account 3 different phone and still got same problem.ƒ± can't see new message notifications. Only way i see it to open Skype.. On PC everything working perfectly. But in android
 os phone no chance.. I think this issue come out after the thing i did and i never fix it again. I was on pc and i set my status busy, it warned me "you will not get any notification in this mode" and i accept it. Then after a while i turn it back to the online
 status but i never get any new message warn after that move. ƒ∞ve tried maybe 20 ways to fix it but nothing helped me. And im deadly sure that all my phone settings are perfectly settled. So, its kind of bug i %100 believe. ƒ∞s there a way to fix that issue?
 Please dont copy paste me standart solutions. ƒ∞ve tried everything step by step. No way. Waiting answer asap. Regards.

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            <p>Sorry to hear of the problem. &nbsp;However the first code you listed suggests that you have a billing violation on your account (money owed). &nbsp;This means that until that is rectified you will not be able to purchase or add any item to your account which is more than likely why you are receiving the other errors.</p>
<p>Give phone support a call and speak with billing to get it sorted.</p>

<p>Running 64-bit Windows 10 Pro Version 1607 with dual monitors.</p>
<p>I've tried: steps referenced at <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/30456...tart-menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.pcworld.com/article/30456...tart-menu.html</span></a> and twice I've done a Windows reinstall where I kept user data. The first time I installed maybe 12 apps, then UltraMon, and the task bar broke again. I figured "OK,
 UltraMon messes with the task bar, maybe that's what broke it." So I started over and installed about the same number of apps, everything fine. Then installed 7Zip and AttibuteChanger and the task bar broke again. I've had all of those apps running on 64-bit
 Win 10 Pro/1607 systems, one with dual monitors, without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've run the windows task bar fixer referenced at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-help-windows-start-menu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/w...ows-start-menu</span></a> and got the results posted below. Is there an easy way to fix those problems w/o a complete, clean, install?</p>

    <title>No UEFI options in advanced settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonasty3  say:</h3>
<h2>            No UEFI options in advanced settings</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire V5 - 572P. It came preinstalled with Windows 8. When I try and go into the advanced settings to change UEFI settings, there's not option for it. &nbsp;I'm trying to get rid of the "Secure Boot isn't configured correctly. Build 9600" watermark.
 Also, even prior to installing 8.1 this option was never available. I've been reading on other questions that it might help if I can change the secure boot settings, but I cant access them. Any help would be much appreciated.
                </div>

            I can't find the link to the original solution but this worked for me.
<div>- Restart your computer and while its booting and press F2.</div>
<div>- Go to the security tab and create a supervisor password (1234, something easy to remember)&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Go to the boot tab and make sure secure boot is enabled</div>
<div>- Now select reset secure boot to factory default in the same tab</div>
<div>- Save and exit (located in the last tab)</div>
<div>Now when it boots the watermark might still be there. I rebooted once more and it was gone. Hope this helps.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So if Mass Effect 3 wins GOTY next year, gaming is over?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Ghost Recon?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Or the next fable?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon enough, more games will come out with some sort of kinect support than those without...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Those three titles looked fantastic during the E3 coverage....I'm glad I bought kinect.</p>

            <p>I still don't understand what "InkJet icon" you're clicking on if "there are no InkJet Printers listed in the Devices and Printers" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't understand why the Canon Pixma iP90 wasn't added to the list when you clicked the Windows Update button; it should have been added.&nbsp; However, because it didn't get added, you can get the driver manually.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Internet Explorer (only) go to <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx</a></li><li>At the Microsoft Update Catalog, search for Canon iP90 ( do not include the word "Pixma")<br />
</li><li>The search should result in a list of 7 hits; 3 of these are for Windows 7 (among other versions of Windows)</li><li>When you click on the link for one of the Windows 7 drivers, you'll get a screen like this:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbc1dbd1-bbbd-4cd2-a32b-57ef9998d278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbc1dbd1-bbbd-4cd2-a32b-57ef9998d278" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li>Look at the "Architecture" line.&nbsp; "X86" is the driver for the 32-bit version of Windows 7.&nbsp; "AMD64" is the driver for the 64-bit version of Windows 7.&nbsp; You do NOT want the driver for "IA64."</li><li>Once you have decided which of the 3 Windows 7 drivers is the correct one for your system, click the "Add" button at the right end of the line.</li><li>Click "View basket" (just under the search box)</li><li>Click the "Download" button</li><li>You should get a pop-up window that says "Download options."&nbsp; Click the "Browse" button, respond to the UAC prompt as necessary, and select the directory (folder) where you would like to save the downloaded file.&nbsp; I suggest that you save the file to your
 Desktop.</li><li>Click the "Continue" button and wait for the download to complete.</li><li>When the download completes, click "Close."&nbsp; You can also close Internet Explorer at this time if you like.</li><li>The download will be a folder (if you selected your Desktop in step 9, the folder will be on your Desktop) named "Canon driver update for Canon Inkjet iP90."&nbsp; In that folder will be a file with a name comprising a very long string of characters.&nbsp; The file
 will be a "Cabinet" type file (i.e., the file extension will be .cab).</li><li>If you have an archiving utility such as 7-zip (<a href="http://7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://7-zip.org/</a>) installed, you can extract the contents of the *.cab file using that utility. Otherwise, you'll have to use the built-in
 "Expand" command in a Command Prompt window.&nbsp; For help with the Expand command, open a Command Prompt window and type
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expand /?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you need more explicit directions, please ask (although using 7-zip would be faster).<br />
</li><li>With your printer NOT connected to the computer, get back to the "Add printer driver wizard" (if you can't remember how you did it the last time, please ask for directions)</li><li>When you get to the screen that lists printer manufacturers, select Canon, and then click "Have disk"</li><li>Browse to the folder where you extracted the files from the *.cab file in step 13.&nbsp; Select the file with an icon like this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7084663b-efaa-4130-a78b-0979611ed373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7084663b-efaa-4130-a78b-0979611ed373" /></a><br />
and click "Open."</li><li>Click OK, then select Canon iP90 from the list and complete the wizard</li><li>Connect your printer to your computer and turn the printer on.&nbsp; It should now be recognized and installed.</li></ol>

            Ciao RichardReckdenwald, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, you can try one of the methods described below in respective order.
<br />
<br />1) UPDATE ASSISTANT
<br />As a first troubleshooting option, please try updating through update assistant (use Update now and, if not working, Update tool -Download tool now):
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />2) RUN WINDOWS UPDATE TROUBLESHOOTER
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402732...</a>
<br />
<br />3) MANUAL UPDATE THROUGH CATALOG
<br />If the above doesn't work, please find the updates on the Catalog and manually download and install them:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, here is a list of several troubleshooting options.
<br />
<br />4) RESET WINDOWS UPDATE
<br />
<br />4.1 RESET WINDOWS UPDATE MANUALLY
<br />a)  Start ‚Äì&gt; All Programs ‚Äì&gt; Accessories ‚Äì&gt; right click on Command Prompt -&gt; select "Run as Administrator". Type net stop wuauserv to stop Windows Update Service. 
<br />
<br />Wait till you get : The windows update service was stopped successfully. " (DO NOT CLOSE COMMAND PROMPT).
<br />
<br />b)  - Go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution 
<br />- Delete all files in "DataStore" folder
<br />- Delete all files in "Download" folder. 
<br />
<br />c) In the Command prompt window, type net start wuauserv to start Windows Update service. 
<br />
<br />Restart your computer and try to get update again (this should fix the issue permanently).
<br />
<br />If you are unable to reset Windows Update manually:
<br />
<br />4.2 RESET WINDOWS UPDATE WITH A SCRIPT

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />The error code has the following explanation:
<br />
<br />ERROR_EVENTLOG_CANT_START
<br />1501 (0x5DD)
<br />No event log file could be opened, so the event logging service did not start.
<br />
<br />Please type in Services.msc in Run dialog box and see if Windows event services are not disabled.
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Thank You for your help. Actually my computer is running version 1607 not 1703.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Still getting the can't create files error but I delete them and the computer works fine. Currently it is not trying to update and thinks it's current.</p>
<p>Thanks again. If you have any other thoughts I'll give them a try.</p>

            No more thoughts at the moment, trying to upgrade your system could lead to instability. You can work with this version of Windows at the moment.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry I couldn't do more.
<br />
<br />If you don't have any further question, could you please mark this thread as solved?

<br />Ciao and thanks

<h2>            Windows 10 re-activation problem &#38; black screen after restart</h2>
                    <p>hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been at this now for two days and getting a bit frustrated. A few weeks ago I received a message asking me to re-enter my windows licence code to activate windows...</p>
<p>I entered my code but it didnt work, I ended up downloading updates for windows 10 which seemed to get rid of the message but a few weeks later, ive lost the use of some programs and its telling me I need to enter my licence code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...I have been using the chat facility to speak with microsoft tech agents who provided me with a new code which i had to purchase, this did not work either and they came to the conclusion my windows is corrupt, so i need to do a clean install on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was emailed instructions to do this, downloaded it to a USB flash drive and went to find the boot menu so I could restart from the usb to install windows 10 but when windows restarts all I get after the logo loading screen is a black screen. This has always
 been the case when restarting but when you press power off and on it comes on the load the log-in screen which is fine but in the case of getting the boot menu up it means I cant access it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>anybody able to help solve this??</p>

<h2>            Mouse&#47;Touchpad problems when multiple users logged in</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Asus UX32V laptop with Windows 8 installed. I have installed latest drivers from Asus. There are two Microsoft Live accounts that are constantly used.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have noticed some problems when multiple users are logged in simultaneously.</div>
<div>First I noticed that touchpad multitouch stops working at some point. Reboot is needed to make it work again.</div>
<div>Then I bought Logitech M185 wireless mouse. I installed Logitech SetPoint, since changing mouse sensitivity from Windows 8 did not seem to have any affect. There are similar problems with M185. Mouse scroll wheel works only with the first user that logs
 in. Second user must either reboot or log out, sign in as other user, log another user out and log in again, to make it work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions what could be done here?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, and thanks for the reply.
<div><br />
<div>I did not find any issues with hardware troubleshooter.</div>
<div>I allready had latest chipset and touchpad drivers installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I managed to fix my mouse by removing Logitech SetPoint and using drivers provided by Microsoft. Now mouse works with two accounts logged in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suppose, for the touchpad I just need to wait until manufacturer releases updated drivers.</div>

    <title>CPU usage at 100&#37; after newest windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcwhiplash  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU usage at 100&#37; after newest windows update</h2>
                    So after the newest windows update my CPU is running at 100%. I've looked through the forums and seen similar cases but the fixes havnt worked for me. When I boot into safe mode my CPU runs normal. There isn't one rogue process hogging it all, it's like
 the CPU is set to run at 100% and allocates all its power to just whatever I have running so even if Im running nothing but task manager it will be running task manager at 90% or so. Ive changed the CPU minimum setting in the power settings but no fix. I've
 done a clean reinstall of windows 10 but no fix. I'd tried deleting and re downloading updates and rolling back updates but nothing is working. Any ideas?
                </div>

            Unfortunately I had come across this article and tried everything. I did again after the windows reinstall but alas to no avail. I also downloaded a driver updater that updated all my drivers but CPU still running at 100%.

            Thank you for responding but none of it helps. I boot into safe mode and CPU is fine but even if I disable all services it stays at 100%. Im wondering if it is some kind of hardware incompatibility issue I'm having with Windows 10 and may try and install
 Windows 7.

            Any other ideas? It seems like the CPU is being told to operate at 100% at all times and then just allocates resources to whatever is running as there is no single offender hogging everying. I've updated all drivers. I've tried disabling services but nothing
 changes.

    <title>Recycle Bin on another drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recycle Bin on another drive</h2>
                    <p>I did not have this problem before plugging in an external hard drive to the main PC. The recycle bin is now allocated to this drive for some reason. No problem you might say but it is a problem inasmuch, it does not open immediately and I have to wait at
 least 20 seconds to access it whilst the external hard drive fires up. I have tried changing it to C drive in the recycle bin properties but it won't stay there. I do not leave the external drive running permanently as it is noisy and I don't use it that much
 other than to store stuff. Why has the bin allocated itself to this drive and how on earth do I rectify it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Have solved the problem myself in one second, pulled out the external drive and the recycle bin reverted back to the main PC. Saved myself a whole lot of headache by not doing a factory reset which somehow, in the past, has never solved my problems anyway.
 Wish I'd though of doing this in the first place. Will now just plug the external drive in when I need it.

<p>Das ist ein ganz anderes Thema und gilt in Verbindung mit dem Rewards Programm.</p>
<p>Und solange du nichts gezahlt hast f√ºr Gold (Testmonat, 48h usw.) z√§hlt Rewards das nicht.</p>
<p>Hier im Thread ging es um ganz etwas anderes und in dem Fall IST der Testmonat = normal Gold.</p>
