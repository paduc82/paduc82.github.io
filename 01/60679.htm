    <title>Windows 10 and a Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and a Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Ok so what are you suppose to do when windows 10 doesn't work? Right now, I've been trying to sign in to my desktop, but it will not proceed past &nbsp;the welcome screen. All it does is sit there with the loading icon, it will not load in to desktop at all.
 I've had a few issues with Win10 on my desktop since I installed it yesterday. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My anti-virus was not working. It still would not work after updating and trouble shooting. So I uninstalled it so I could re-install it. The problem is, even though it is uninstalled it is still running in my in my background programs(not sure how this
 happened). So it still counts as being installed, even though the process will not end when you click end task in the task manager. How can this be when I uninstalled the program yesterday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Programs refusing to open. This is usually fixed with a restart. But even when I could load in to my desktop to work on this, my programs wouldn't open. I tried a system refresh, that failed due to my uninstalled antivirus software running. Troubleshoot
 a bit on that. After that my settings wouldn't open. I had to win+r to get in to my settings to just do a full restore, which it wouldn't let me. Now my control panel windows and file explorer windows keep going to not responding. These won't close even when
 you end task in task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Programs I had working yesterday mainly for games are not working. I first I thought compatability issue, not that not it. All my applications quick working. The only thing I can open on my desktop is my internet browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows will not longer load in to desktop so I can work on it. I have manually restarted it several time trying to get in on safe mode at least, this isn't happening. So now I'm stuck with a desktop that will not load windows past the login screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now before you say it is something that I have done. I will assure you I have not changed any of the window settings. The most I have done is work with personalization to try and make windows fit my monitor screen, which it's still doesn't. So windows isn't
 very good in HDMI mode. Windows is still bigger than my monitor, no matter what resolution or screen size I choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problem did not exist when I had Win8.1 on my desktop. Now I can even get in to it to restore it back to 8.1 and try re-installing Win10. I've looked over forums and discussions. there isn't an answer to this any where. So how am I supposed to fix
 this when Windows doesn't load past the login screen?</p>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience on Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand you have multiple issues in Windows 10. To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the apps troubleshooter and check if it helps with the issue. Refer to the following article and run the Apps troubleshooter:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</span></a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Well I would do all of this.&nbsp; I had gotten it back to Win 8.1 and working. Though still minus antivirus software as neither Win Defender nor Avast will start. Now my newest problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night my comp on Win 8.1 did a update, force restart. I had to fight with it to get login in order to see what was going on. Finally got in, nothing worked right. So I upgrade to Win10 once again. Now I'm back to the same problems. I've been trying
 to run all these scans as you suggested. But, exactly how can I do that, nothing works right. My setting window will open and stay blank, close it, re-open, still the same, a completely empty window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win + X calls up the menu but when none of the windows will load after a select one. So the SFC scan is out. Can't do that. Can't do the add user as those windows don't open properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only program I have that is working semi-correctly right now is Iobits Advanced System Care. Which I had to skip two scans on, registry and security. The security scan for it is normally windows updates, keeps my comp updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got in to Win 10 finally, I had a Nvidia update. Well no big thing there, means update it. Aside from the fact that Geforce Experience will not open. So I can't update my graphics driver to Win10. So I said, time to restart. Well... that was before
 I came here, so it's been on the restarting screen for a good 10 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now it seems my only available option to fixing this, is to keep fighting til I can get in and open system restore, drop back to 8.1 again, then put my factory restore disk in, wipe my harddrive and start over from scratch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm finding all this completely weird. As I'm using my Asus laptop and it upgraded to Win10 without any problems. Everything works, no program problems or compatability issues. Wish I could say the same thing for my iBuypower TD-774 desktop. Amd
 6 core processor, Geforce 740 2gb ram, 8gb SDD Ram, 1tb HDD. Maybe the fact that my desktop is built for gaming is the problem. Or that fact that it is a desktop and Windows is trying releasing OS that are designed to work on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok it has been 25 mins of my desktop "restarting" time for a manual restart.</p>

            <p>2:51pm. Back in to windows. Go to do some of the suggested things on the only account on the comp, which is the admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) SFC scan. win +x to open menu, click command prompt(admin) it will not open. Command Prompt normal will however open. But that doesn't allow a SFC scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Tack Manager will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Control Panel did open. But as soon as I clicked create account, or manage another account, in this case, control panel locked up, won't even close. Close X for the window is flashing. Close through task bar will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Start Menu will not open. Had to win + x to go to sign out. Which it isn't doing. I would have tried to restart that way. But giving the fact the only way I can get that to work is with a manual shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my Windows 10 doesn't work right at all. Even after I dropped back to 8.1 last time that didn't even fully work right. So with all these problems, that&nbsp;didn't start until I installed Windows 10,&nbsp; can I get some help that isn't the top three suggestions
 off google search?</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these problems existed until Windows 10. If I have to take my computer in to have it fixed that way,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;is paying for it.

<p>Yes, you will definitely need to reactivate again, you are making significant changes to your computer.</p>
<p>Please note, if Windows 7 came preloaded with your computer, you will need to purchase a new license, OEM licenses are not transferable to another computer.</p>
<p>If its a full version license, you can reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p><br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
<br />
<strong>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</strong><br />
<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system<strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>a:</strong>Open the <strong>Network and Sharing Center.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>b:</strong>Select <strong>Set up a new connection or Network</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>c:</strong>Select <strong>Manually connect to a wireless network</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>d:</strong>Enter <strong>Network name</strong>- this is case sensitive.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>e</strong>:Save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the problem you are likely having:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>f:</strong> Either choose the change settings or find the network profile you just created under Manage Wireless Networks, and open it up.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>g: </strong>On the <strong>Security tab</strong> you will see Security Type is&nbsp;
<strong>No authentication (Open)</strong>. You likely have to set it to <strong>Shared.
</strong>Now you have to re-enter your security key.</span></p>

            <p>Hey</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had the same problem, I just got my new W8.1 and was trying to connect it to activate windows, and when after several tries it wouldn't work, I finally searched it up and found out that apparently windows took out the 'Shared' option because it's apparently
 too insecure.&nbsp;Don't get too excited for a solution yet though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a work or other network, I don't know anyway to connect to it, but if it's a home network, you can easily change it to an open, or a WPA if you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just log into your WiFi router [usually 192.168.100.100], type in your username and password [if you've never done this before it'll just be 'admin' [check you're router if that doesn't work, it's usually written on there], go into Wireless [under Setttings],
 then just change the security type [I'd recommend WPA2].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found any other solution to this. I know it's really annoying, but this is the only way I found to cope with it... someone more experienced in IT can probably explain it better, and if you want step by step instructions on how to changed it from
 WEP to WPA, just search it, you'll get some useful answers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck :D&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just checked the settings now. It was already disabled...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Would it have made much of a difference anyway? If Windows 8 really did take out that option [and by the sheer number of people who couldn't connect with WEP Shared and with no one that I've seen so far being able to, I'm assuming they did take it out],
 then changing the MAC filtering settings shouldn't change the outcome...</em></p>
<p><em>I don't really know much about this, but this whole thing kind of helps you make your router more secure right? So if you can change it, then it's probably best that you do... Although it would suck for those using a work or school network... I guess
 then the whole MAC address thing might come in handy... but like I said before, would it really help connect your device to the internet?</em></p>

            It's probaly their site.&nbsp; They never inform the players if the site is encountering a problem...That's why you can still play alone.

            Hello RhiaG,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Calculator app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.WindowsCalculator | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Calculator app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Okay I'm not very technical and this blue screen thing is very confusing. I keep getting it about once a day. I followed directions on the Dell website and downloaded the Windows Debugger. That didn't seem to do anything so I've been emailing one of the
 Dell people and they got me to scan the hard drive and it didn't find anything. Then tried to get me to do system restore on safe more to before it started happening but there weren't any dates before it started. I then called someone up today and we ran some
 tests by pressing F12 and going on diagnostics and they said it was a system error. They say I need to put my computer back to factory settings and pay ¬£60 for that. Is there another way of me sorting this out? And if there isn't can I do that on my own without
 having to pay ¬£60? I've only had this laptop for less than 2 months and I don't understand why I have got this blue screen...can anyone explain simply? My computer is a Dell Inspiron 15R. I'll post the results of the windows debugger program below as that
 might make sense to someone! I would really appreciate any suggestions!</p>

<h2>            juego de xbox original no funciona</h2>
                    
<p>hola, hace tiempo compre por medio del bazar el juego de XBOX original Ninja Gaiden Black, lo descargue a mi disco duro de 20 gb y funciono a la perfeccion, debido a la poca capacidad de mi disco duro, opte por comprar uno de mayor capacidad, en el que volvi
 a descargar el juego pero ya no funciono, me dice: Error, vuelve a descargar el juego.</p>
<p>ya lo he descargado como 3 veces sin poder hacer que este funcione, alguien le ha pasado lo mismo o sabe que hacer??</p>

<p>Bueno mira, Habia Escuchado del Problema que no se Podia Descargar el Juego, Te lo Dejaba al 98 - 99 %, Obvio no se Puede Jugar
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/p/287460/1523532.aspx#1523532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1523532.aspx</a> , Pero Al Final Dicen que ya Esta Resuelto eso.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ahora por lo que Mencionas que en USB si Funcionan los Juegos pero en tu DD Nuevo No. Eso de Nuevo Puede ser un Decir, a mi me Toco Comprar Unos Discos Duros en Distribuidores Oficiales y Eran Reconstruidos, Venian con los Conectores un Poco Flojos. Entonces
 Quizas el Tullo Viene con el Defecto que no Cumple con los Requerimientos Minimos para Correr Juegos de Gigas. Si Fuera asi, Te Tienen que Cambiar el Disco Duro, Sin Costo en el Mejor de los Casos. El Problem que te Piden la Factura (Ticket) Original para
 Hacerte el Cambio.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aproposito Esta Barato el Juego (800mp), se me Hace que lo Voy a Comprar.</p>

<p>pues la verdad esta un poco raro el asunto por que en el disco duro de 320 no agarran los juegos descargados del bazar, pero si instalo uno desde el disco lo puedo jugar sin problema, al contrario del disco de 20gb que no hay ninguna clase de falla con el,
 i creo que valio por que el ticket no lo tengo :(</p>
<p>i sii ee, si esta barato por que yo cuando lo compre a principios de a√±o valio 1200, parece que le bajaron a todos los de xbox original, yo aproveche y ayer compre el Black, asi que aprovecha :)</p>
<p>hablare a soporte aver como me pueden ayudar.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create a yellow spotlight around my Windows 7 Cursor.&nbsp; I do not want to download any software.&nbsp; However, I do have the 64Bit Photoshop CC 2014.&nbsp; I am recording a computer desktop presentation and I need people to be able to see where the cursor
 is located at all times as it navigates between PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, SCOPIA Desktop Client User Interface and Windows 7 Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Radio Start Button&gt;Control Panel&gt;Mouse&gt;Pointers</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I tried to find the cursor with the yellow spotlight in <em>Customize</em> to no avail.</p>

            <p>The yellow dot you see in presentations and demos is added by the video recording software automatically (I use a program called Camtasia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't do this on your own by yourself, so if you aren't willing to use the software everyone else does, then you can't do it.

            Thank you for the info. Well, with 1700 of them, I guess I will look into taking out a Geek Squad or Microsoft Tech support contract and save myself the aggravation. Again, thanks!

            If you're talking about Event Viewer, the overwhelming majority of errors and warnings are meaningless. I've got thousands of them - over 800 in the last 24 hours - and my computer runs flawlessly. Look up some of those errors and warnings and you'll see
 that they have no practical meaning for you. In most cases, what we think of as an error and what Microsoft counts as an error are different things.

            Hi  wellinever 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you post a screenshot of what you are seeing on the screen?
<br />
<br />It might be an issue with your display ribbon and not Windows itself. 
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular Windows and Safe Mode) is to<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.</p>
<p>First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span></a></p>
<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1</span></a></p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it<br />
only has to be bootable).</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair -</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />
<a href="http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span></a></p>
<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>
<p>ren Logs LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there are spaces between ren and Logs and Logsold)</p>
<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Resetting your PC removes any applications installed, removes any personal files, drivers, settings and is a good thing to do if you want to fully clean the drive. Please take note that this might take an hour or two.<br />
<br />
You can follow the steps under the selection entitled, "<strong>Reset your PC</strong>", and "<strong>Remove everything</strong>" option from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens after performing the reset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Windows store not opening after cumulative update KB3081455 in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After updating the latest windows 10 cumulative update kb3081455 in windows 10, windows store is not opening/working. Its flashing on screen without showing any content and closing without any error. Need assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Checked "sfc/scannow" and got no integrity violations.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Store worked nice before but not after updating.</p>
<p>I am not sure that I am alone with this issue, Please check the issue.</p>
<p>I even dont know that it caused by the update, but its happening. I am not blaming the cumulative update but windows store isnt opening even after restarting PC several times.</p>

            Not only is the Store not working after the update, the IHeart radio app is not working as well. Come on Microsoft, you can do better than this. You would think that after the first Store fiasco and subsequent crash, you would know better by now.&nbsp;

<p>Is Windows 10 really this terribly built? I mean, come on! At least the store in Windows 8.1 works reliably.

 install and still same issue. Its for sure that the update kb 3081455 is the root cause of windows store bug. Microsoft have to sort out the bug and provide another update soon so as to cure this bug.

            Tried them all and I even did a clean install of windows.&nbsp; Did not work.&nbsp; Now I can't open the windows store to reinstall any program.&nbsp; The window opens for a second and then it crashes with no error message.&nbsp; The window simply goes away.&nbsp; Kind of like
 my loyalty to MS at this point.

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t log in with main account after getting double - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t log in with main account after getting double billed.</h2>
                    
<p>I used a 12 month code back in October for my main account. On January 14th of this month, MS decided to bill me anyway for one month automatically. It created a glitch and I wasn't able to go online with my account. I called support and they told me to
 try to delete and redownload my account. It will not let me download account. So I can not even play offline games on my main account now. Support said this is a unique circumstance and they will escalate it to the account specialists blah blah blah. So for
 the last 17 days I can not play Xbox and they double billed me. Has this happened to anyone else before and why is it everytime I call back I am told it was escalated and nothing new to report? Again, I was double billed and I can't even download my profile
 to play offline using my saved games...since January 14th.</p>

    <title>Unable to remove infection kvthost.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverpulser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to remove infection kvthost.exe</h2>
                    <p>original title:&nbsp; kvthost.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running XP Home SP3 all updates on a Dell 4550, 2Gb ram, P4 3.06Ghz, Nvidia 6800GS AGP, 120Gb HD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a recurring problem with a file flagged by Advanced SystemCare. The file is named kvthost.exe and resides in the Windows system32 folder. Advanced SystemCare shows it to be a Gen trojan horse and spyware. It cleans it only to find it again when I
 scan after a week or so..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know what kvthost.exe does. Looking at the file properties it shows it as being created in 2003 and last accessed in 2008 with a file size of 1.1mb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither NOD32 nor SuperAntiSpyware finds this problem, only Advanced SystemCare.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the activities on the computer have gone through may have caused this. We suggest accessing the Advanced Options by following the steps on this

<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a></strong> so that you can load to a point where the device was working fine. Otherwise, safe mode. Additionally,
 plug another mouse to isolate whether it will be recognized or not. We look forward to your update.</p>

    <title>Apps keep minimizing when I move my cursor after opening them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryansuzuki1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apps keep minimizing when I move my cursor after opening them</h2>
                    <p>For context: Google Chrome is always in full screen in the background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open a new application such as file explorer or steam which is not full screened, I will often minimize it to go back to using chrome. However, whenever I try to reopen the app by clicking on it in the taskbar as soon as I move my mouse it instantly
 minimizes. The only way for me to access the app is by alt+tab while my cursor is within where the app will be. If I move the cursor out of the box of the app while I'm using it also minimizes it. If Chrome is not open in the background then everything works
 fine, as in I can move in and out of the box without it minimizing. This didn't happen before, it started when I launched Terraria for the first time on my computer and it messed up the resolution . However, I reset the resolution and this is still happening.</p>

            Hi RyanSuzuki1
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. You can also try to reset your display driver
<br />Windows Key+CTRL+SHIFT+B
<br />
<br />2. Try running SFC / DISM and check after this

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
