    <title>How about software as bad as OneDrive is, Still Allowed to be - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How about software as bad as OneDrive is, Still Allowed to be sold&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here, are some just a&nbsp;<em>few</em> bugs that users complaint about OneDrive, no matter the Windows or Operating System you have:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Onedrive stuck "processing changes" 3 weeks now - StallErrorSummary = [Source:1 Reason:312] what's reason 312?</em></li><li><em>No network connection' while uploading files/ photos into Onedrive</em></li><li><em>OneDrive - infinite sync</em></li><li><em>Is OneDrive upload normally this slow and obstructive to internet usage?</em></li><li><em>OneDrive corrupts files and makes them unreadable and undeletable on local machine but accessible from web</em></li><li><em>OneDrive Won't Stop Downloading Files to my Hardrive</em></li><li>OneDrive gets stuck uploading or downloading at 0.0 KB/s</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Some issues above are noticed/created about 2 years ago and since now there is no fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why People keeping using this crap software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is so incompetent that cannot fix this issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cheaper price really matters when you can&nbsp;<em>loose all your files</em> because a buggy software was newer fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop to complain about this **** called OneDrive. I almost lose all my files in the past when I used the "Available Online" option, and after OneDrive crashed I had to download all my files again from web: it took me almost 3 weeks to download everything
 again since the local index was corrupted and local client simply refuses to download the files even they have stored in the same folder in both local and cloud places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From time to time I came back here to find out if these bugs were fixed, but what I discover is the people with the same problem, same bugs, and the solution that Microsoft provided is to "Lock OneDrive Forum".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should discontinue OneDrive: they should give up and leave the better programmers from Google or DropBox to keeping create a usable product since OneDrive could be called a sync program: OneDrive is not reliable at all: there is no customer support
 for it (just an Indian guy following the same **** call center script) and the help line staff had one single answer for every OneDrive issue: it yours fault: It yours pc, yours internet service provider, and never a issue in OneDrive program itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do a favor for yourself: Dont USE OneDrive. Use any other Sync program an not this forever beta version that Microsoft call's "OneDrive".</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I don't have any problem with an Indian Guy/Girl doing their job on the other side of line: these are poor people hired to hear the same complain every single day and have all my respect. I have a problem with their bosses that have a fat salary and
 bonuses and keep doing their horrible job that resumes in don't hear the customers, keep them unsatisfied and give a **** to solve their problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a&nbsp;<em>little&nbsp;</em><em>frustrated</em><em>?&nbsp;</em>OH YEAH! Yes, I'am! Since I did the same stupid thing that I did in the past: believed that OneDrive in the new Windows 10 came to an usable state but I'm miserable wrong: the software is It's as bad as
 it always was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's back to use Google Drive again. My lucky that I newer deleted / move any single file from Google Drive share... If I had did it my frustration will be higher than It was now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe should I put a schedule script to issue this command every 5 minutes, because doing this by hand is totally pain in the ass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After issuing this command, the OneDrive works like a charm for next 5 minutes. As soon the sync starts again, the problems arise. In two different machines. Two different hardware specs... And the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask anyone that used OneDrive in the past (there is a huge number of people like this) if at least 80% have face at least one of the problems that I've listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm not using OneDrive from 2 weeks. I asked for my money back and I will continue to use Google Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I guess the problem is not in the amount of data in the Cloud (54.000 but uploaded automatically along the time) but the files in the disk and the whole process to upload it to Cloud in a single transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single time that I tried OneDrive was a totally mess: This time I got a new Laptop: Corei7, 32GB RAM, M2 SSD Disk, and at the same time I upgraded the Fiber Link provided by my local ISP.<br />
<br />
I did the same test using DropBox and Google Drive: no single issue. No single glitch. Nothing. All data was been sincronized in question of 2, 3 hours at max.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Using the latest OneDrive took almost 2 days, and the upload has not finished yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if you look into support forum you will see a lot of people around the globe with the SAME issues as described by me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I don't believe that problem is me or my gear: something is very wrong with this product and Microsoft not give a ****.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I finally give up. I come back do Google Drive and I will not recommend to anyone this crap&nbsp; and buggy software.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Intermittently Getting Stuck at Lock Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Intermittently Getting Stuck at Lock Screen</h2>
                    <p>This error starting occurring after installing the anniversary update on Lenovo X1 Carbon running Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a long period -- typically overnight -- of being shut down, Windows 10 will not advance past the lockscreen. &nbsp;Everything appears normal, but once I type in my password/pin/fingerprint the swirling loading bar rolls around and after a minute or so returns
 me to the login screen. If I keep trying to log in it never does, but if I restart it and try again (sometimes as many as ten times) eventually it logins in normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Information: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Computer boots into safemode without issue.&nbsp;</li><li>Startup repair returns an unsuccessful result and tells me the location of the log file.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any hint on how to fix this?</p>
<p>

</p><p>I tried everything in Ratandeep's post, but alas login problem persisted. I then tried rolling back to before the update and the issue stopped for a couple days. However, once the updates happened again the issue cropped back up.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Turtle Beach X12 - chat won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work with new controllers</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a turtle beach X12... USB is powered, I get audio just fine... but I went to plug in from the headset controller to my "Lunar white" xbox one controller and the 2.5mm didn't fit like it did with the 360... so I bought a 2.5 female to 3.5 male adapter
 and now everything is connected but people can't hear me... what is the deal here? I have audio just fine because it's coming from the TV, but from the turtle beach to my new controller it isn't picking up the mic.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? What is the point of the 3.5mm input on the bottom of the new controllers? &nbsp;Why isn't it picking up the mic? &nbsp;the firmware should be up to date and all that so idk what to do and really don't want to spend $100 on a new headset when
 this one is still rocking... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<p>That doesn't work. &nbsp;A gamestop employee told me the X12 won't work on new controllers because it's analog and it only works with digital or something... does anyone know, if I buy the (overpriced) headset xbox one headset adapter will it work then?</p>

 portion.&nbsp; My <strong>question is </strong>do you or do you not pull the installation disk before the restart.&nbsp; It appears to be&nbsp;communicating and starting&nbsp;the Disk install all over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />You should follow these steps performing a fresh installation.
<br />
<br />Many PCs now include the ability to use the UEFI version of BIOS, which can speed up boot and shutdown times and can provide additional security advantages. To boot your PC in UEFI mode, you'll need to use a drive formatted using the GPT drive format.
<br />
<br />Many PCs are ready to use UEFI, but include a compatibility support module (CSM) that is set up to use the legacy version of BIOS. This version of BIOS was developed in the 1970s and provides compatibility to a variety of older equipment and network configurations, and requires a drive that uses the MBR drive format.
<br />
<br />However, the basic MBR drive format does not support drives over 4TB. It's also difficult to set up more than four partitions. The GPT drive format lets you set up drives that are larger than 4 terabytes (TB), and lets you easily set up as many partitions as you need.
<br />Reformatting the drive using a different partition style
<br />To wipe and convert the drive by using Windows Setup
<br />
<br />    Turn off the PC, and put in the Windows installation DVD or USB key.
<br />
<br />    Boot the PC to the DVD or USB key in UEFI mode. For more info, see Boot to UEFI Mode or Legacy BIOS mode. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh8...</a>
<br />
<br />    When choosing an installation type, select Custom.
<br />
<br />    On the Where do you want to install Windows? screen, select each of the partitions on the drive, and select Delete. The drive will show a single area of unallocated space.
<br />
<br />    Select the unallocated space and click Next. Windows detects that the PC was booted into UEFI mode, and reformats the drive using the GPT drive format, and begins the installation.
<br />
<br />To manually wipe a drive and convert it to GPT:
<br />
<br />    Turn off the PC, and put in the Windows installation DVD or USB key.
<br />
<br />    Boot the PC to the DVD or USB key in UEFI mode. For more info, see Boot to UEFI Mode or Legacy BIOS mode. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh8...</a>
<br />
<br />    From inside Windows Setup, press Shift+F10 to open a command prompt window.
<br />
<br />    Open the diskpart tool:
<br />
<br />    diskpart
<br />
<br />    Identify the drive to reformat:
<br />
<br />    list disk
<br />
<br />    Select the drive, and reformat it:
<br />
<br />    select disk &lt;disk number&gt;
<br />    clean
<br />    convert gpt
<br />    exit
<br />
<br />    Close the command prompt window.
<br />
<br />    Continue the Windows Setup installation.
<br />
<br />    When choosing an installation type, select Custom. The drive will appear as a single area of unallocated space.
<br />
<br />    Select the unallocated space and click Next. Windows begins the installation.

            Hi CLedfo
<br />
<br />If you changed the boot order in order to boot from the Installation media, during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point, only remove the installation media when you reach the desktop . . .

<p>I Thank you for your help,&nbsp; My <strong>BIOs Boot </strong>is set to<strong> Legacy
</strong>because Secure boot would'nt allow me to run the DVD by way of USB program ( message No Boot found, Install operating system ).&nbsp;The &nbsp;boot order for
<strong>Legacy and Secure Boot </strong>have been left on&nbsp;Computer hard drive with the F 9 key set to
<strong>USB, DVD player UEFI</strong>.&nbsp; I was told to leave the DVD installed but change the boot to the computer hard drive.
<strong>Question</strong>, with my current settings for install will it be sufficient when the Restart comes to change Boot mode from Legacy back to Secure? Leaving the DVD to do it's function but prevent it from starting the install again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi CLedfo, yes that sounds to be correct . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not work, when your PC restarts, pop out the installation media, wait for the installation to continue, then immediately put the installation media back in . .

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably need to eject the DVD manually during the first restart...</p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to pull a USB Flash Drive manually at the first restart as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You Might be able to return your Bios to UEFI, select "Boot Options" at restart, and select "UEFI Optical Drive" from the boot menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a "Custom Install"... Delete everything on the HDD and leave it Unallocated...</p>
<p>Install Windows 10 to the Unallocated space and it will set things up as needed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to save part of the HDD space at the end of the drive for DATA, format that part, but leave the first part unallocated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you save a partition for DATA you will need to set the GPT manually first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I actually prefer Legacy Bios on my machines when practical to do so...</p>

<h2>            Stolen Xbox one.</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox one was stolen from me. I was wondering if there is anyway even if they delete my account off of it if I can see when they get on or track them. I have the SSN, could I trace them with that? Is there a way i can see what wifi they are using or a
 location? Find their microsoft account? Or is there absolutely no way to see or track what they do on my xbox? do I have to contact the police?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Report the theft to police and give them the SSN.</p>
<p>Then contact Xbox support by phone and tell them what happened.</p>
<p>They can see when a console is in use and what IP it has but they won't do it unless the police request it of them. They may even block it as a console from going online but that is their decision to make at the time. It is possible they won't though but
 that is to protect themselves against trolls doing it to get someones machine locked out just "for laughs".

<h2>            Isatap &#35;3 device driver problem</h2>
                    Hi I am using Windows 7 Home Premium. When I started up my laptop an error message appeared "isatap adapter # was not successfully installed". So I decided to restart the computer. Upon logging in I checked the adapter under device management and it seems
 to be working. But just to be sure I decided to uninstall and then reinstall the adapter. The problem now is that the isatap adapter #3 keeps on disappearing after I restart the computer. To make it appear I always have to manually install the adapter again
 under device management. Thanks in advance for your help.

<p><span>In some scenarios, there will be a code 31 or code 10 error appearing beside this component. A possible reason is, the network adapter doesn’t

<span>Hi SaikoD,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest that you run the Network Diagnostic Tool on the computer which will help you to fix the networking issues.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click Start &gt;&gt; click Control Panel &gt;&gt; click on Network and Sharing Center &gt;&gt; click on Diagnose and Repair on the left pane.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Fixing Common networking connectivity issues in Vista:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 2: Reset TCP/IP:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 3: Disable the IP Helper service</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Scroll down to the IP Helper service, right click on it and select Properties</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. In the dropdown box that says "Automatic" or "Manual", set it to Disabled and then click on "Apply"</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. Then click on "Stop" to stop the service from running in the current session</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. Click OK to exit the dialog</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 4: Disable IPv6:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack. To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and
 either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters,
 or tunnel adapters.</span></p>
<p>
<span>NOTE: You should do this for each network connection.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 5: Disable the DHCP Broadcast Flag:</span></strong><span>

 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</span></a></span></strong><span>(How
 to back up and restore the registry in Windows)</span></p>
<p>
<span>Windows Vista cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft DHCP servers</span></p>
<p>
<span>To resolve this issue, disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows Vista. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p>
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. Right-click DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>8. Close Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p>
<span>By setting this registry key to 1, Windows Vista will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain
 an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.</span></p>

<p>Go down to "Help"</p>
<p>Click the"About Google Chrome"</p>
<p>A new tap opens, and it will begin updating, if there's one.</p>

<h2>            Ideapad Z585 wifi problems as the speed is very slow while downloading</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using windows 8.1 and have the latest drivers and bios installed, but the downloads are terrible</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.speedtest.net/result/3677871066.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my other devices, they're hitting 28 down and 5 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried lots of things and am about done scouring the net for an answer, so if you any suggestions as to how or why my net ****, please tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do however think that it's a service running in the background that's the problem. When I had a fresh install of win 8 on my ssd on this laptop, the wifi speeds were fine (28down, 5 up). but after installing a few apps and driver updates, the wifi speeds
 crashed again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any suggestions as to what service may be the culprit, do let me know. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I do want to say that I've had this problem before I had windows 8, and it's been killing my internet experience for a long time. Please help me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the reason behind having a device limit for the apps you can install to. I also understand that I'm a bit of an abnormal user, but I have more than 5 devices (legitimately) that I would like to add to my list of Windows 8 machines. Is there
 absolutely no way to do this? Not even through a paid option?</p>

            I'm not asking from the point-of-view of a developer. As a consumer, I'd like to have more than 5 Windows 8 devices on my account that I can install my apps to. Like I said, I understand that most people don't have more than 5 devices, but I do. I'm trying
 to understand if there's any way (even if I have to pay for the additional devices) to be allowed to install the apps I purchase to more than 5 devices.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that all apps can only be installed on a maximum of 5 devices running Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to install the app on more than 5 devices, you can download the app once again and install it on another 5 devices, running Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you have any further questions regarding Windows operating systems, please post them on this forum. We are happy to assist you.<br />

            <p>I am also interested on this case, as I have more than 5 devices.&nbsp; The question is: Can I use my same Microsoft Account for 7 devices?&nbsp;&nbsp; When I try to download a free or paid app on the 6th or 7th device, the system informs me that I reached the limit of
 5 devices and I need to remove one before proceeding to download.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the system doesn't allow download unless you remove a device...</p>
<p>Any thoughts or workaround on the case?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm interested even if it is a paid option to MS..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Same here. I can understand the limitation for paid apps, but why limit the number of installations of "free" apps. I mean, you can get around it pretty easily by connecting your additional devices to a second Microsoft account, but that's rather kludgey,
 especially for those apps that are tied to your Microsoft account (e.g., SkyDrive, Skype, etc.). You're not really limiting distribution in a meaningful way, and you're just annoying an admittedly small niche user base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these apps are offered free for Windows 8 users, then why bother limiting them to such an arbitrarily small number of devices? Like others in this thread, I have multiple Windows 8 devices (including several HTPCs), and I just want to be able to set them
 all up with basic apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate Microsoft raising this limit to 10 devices or consider doing away with it for free apps altogether. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm in the same boat.&nbsp; This policy doesn't provide any protection, it simply inconveniences a(n admittedly small) group of users, for no logical reason.&nbsp; As mentioned, I can use a second account for apps that are in no way linked to me directly, but a second
 account is useless when I want to access my SkyDrive folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a rediculous limitation, I'd like to see the limit raised as well.</p>

            Can we get an answer here?&nbsp; I see that people are even willing to pay for more devices.&nbsp; I think that having more than 5 devices is going to become fairly common.

            <p>You're unlikely to get a response to this question as you replied to a message from early 2013.<br />
<br />
That said, have you noticed any apps that weren't installed per the limitation? <br />
<br />
Maybe the email was sent errorneously.</p>
<p>Perhaps this has something to do with this being the first day of Windows 10 being public.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are unknown circumstances at play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do also keep in mind which thread you're in: This area is for Windows 8, hardly the realm of the new OS.</p>

    <title>Invalid Product Key Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angusbedingfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invalid Product Key Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I created a Windows 7 Partition on my MacBook Pro. I had put in my product key from my HP computer &nbsp;i am using now. and had set up Windows 7 Home Premium on it. It didn't have enough GB's in it so I deleted the partition, and did it all over again. The second
 time It was really laggy and was affecting my mac partition, so i removed it again. Then yesterday I purchased Windows 8, i all loaded up fully buy it said there was an error and it will return to how it was when you ran the installer. It told me my computer
 needed to be activated. Now on my HP computer my a pop up comes up every once and a while and it reads:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A change&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to your Windows license file</strong></p>
<p><strong>You must re-type your Windows product key to activate online.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then do this, I am sure I type the key correctly. And after it's almost finished an error appears and says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The product key you have entered does not appear to be a valid Windows 7 product key.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please check your product key, and type it again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then do this over and over and over again. Never works. I tried to find a key online but i found nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help! Been searching how to resolve this issue all day. All the guides told me to reset my PC. But i need all my files cause i have had this computer since 2006 and i do not want to mess anything up. Help!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Keyboard and Mouse won&#39;t work on Windows 10 Startup screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this morning I plugged in a lexar usb stick into one of our computers at church and then all of a sudden none of my usb ports works. Mouse won't work and keyboard won't work. The funny thing is that it will work on a recovery of windows and the bios menu
 of the computer but not the windows 10 screen to log in. It has done this to 2 of our important computers and I need them to work asap. I looked in the bios of both computers and it all is working fine. Our computers are to new for them to have ps2 ports so
 that is out of the quesiton. If anyone has any theory as to why this is happening then please I would love a solution and a fix. To note I also plugged that same usb stick into another computer but that has windows 7 on it. But it worked fine and everything
 works on it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trying to mirror a disk with Windows 7 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kfrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to mirror a disk with Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    I would like to mirror an external drive with a second external dive. &nbsp;I can find no documentation on how to accomplish this task. &nbsp;The primary drive is set up as Dynamic with one simple partition and it contains data. &nbsp;I have tried various configurations
 of the intended mirror drive but none seem to "ungrey" the Add Mirror option on the primary drive.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any guidance would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's most frustrating is that while creating a striped set up is documented, mirroring does not appear to be.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi <strong>Kfrey,</strong></p>
<p>Connect to the Remote Computer</p>
<p>1. Log on as administrator or as a member of the Administrators group.</p>
<p>2. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Click Performance and Maintenance, click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management.</p>
<p>3. Right-click Computer Management (Local), and then click Connect to another computer.</p>
<p>4. Click Another computer, type the name of the computer to which you want to connect, and then click OK. Or, click Browse to locate the computer, and then click OK twice.</p>
<p>The Computer Management window of the remote computer is displayed. Expand Storage (if it is not already expanded), and then click Disk Management.</p>
<p>Create a Mirrored Volume on the Remote Computer</p>
<p>1. In the Disk Management window, right-click unallocated space on one of the dynamic disks in which you want to create the mirrored volume, and then click New Volume.</p>
<p>2. In the New Volume Wizard, click Next.</p>
<p>3. Click Mirrored volume, and then click Next.</p>
<p>4. Under All available dynamic disks, click the disk in which you want to host the mirror, and then click Add. Verify that the disks in which you want to create a mirrored volume are listed in the Selected dynamic disks box.</p>
<p>5. In the Size box, specify the amount of unallocated disk space to use for the volume, and then click Next.</p>
<p>6. Assign a drive letter or path, and then click Next.</p>
<p>7. Specify the formatting options that you want to use, and then click Next.</p>
<p>8. Confirm that the options that you selected are correct, and then click Finish. The mirrored volume is created and appears in the appropriate dynamic disks in the Disk Management window.</p>
<p>9. Quit Disk Management on the remote computer.</p>

I enabled logging according to this site (<a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/wmdc/debug/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/wmdc/debug/index.htm</a>)
 and found the following error trace in the resulting log file. It appears to be crash while trying to use a non TrueType font. The user's display fonts are all set to the default Segoe UI 9pt. I also tried on a different account on the computer with the same
 result. What fonts would Windows Mobile Device Center be trying to load that causes this crash? There are a few 3rd party barcode fonts installed but they are TrueType and I assume Device Center wouldn't be trying to load those.

            It seems as if the GDI+ Font Cache became corrupted somehow. Deleting GDIPFONTCACHEV1.dat at C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local and C:\Windows\System32 corrected the issue and allowed Windows Mobile Device Center to launch.
<div><br />
<div>I looked on another machine and GDIPFONTCACHEV1.dat was not in System32 folder but was in the AppData folder. I am unsure how it got there on the machine having problems.</div>

<h2>            DLC на eBay</h2>
                    
<p>Сегодня заметил интересную вещь. На eBay продаются DLC коды, например для BF BC2, по очень интересной цене в $0.99. Вопрос собственно в чем, кто-нибудь пробовал отдельно покупать DLC, вне родного маркета?</p>

<h2>            Mathcad 14 will not run after successful install</h2>
                    I have a new laptop and am installing MathCad as the first software package.&nbsp; Installation responds with success.&nbsp; Congratulations after installing liscence.&nbsp; When I open mathcad 14 from start menu, the message...&nbsp; Mathcad has stopped working correctly
 appears.&nbsp; This is software that I had intalled on XP, so I believe the disk I am installing it from is okay.&nbsp; PTC has supplied me with a new licence for the new machine (I sent them the hard drive id and they supplied new licence).&nbsp; I occasionally see a list
 of .ocx and .dll files not registered.&nbsp; I have tried initiating the administrator privilages, and re-install/repair.&nbsp; Same results.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;
<br />

Automatic reports have been sent to Microsoft.

            After spending the last 48 hours trying to resolve this issue which involved talking to PTC for two hours, I finally was able to reinstall the program successfully. &nbsp;If you are getting an error message during the installation that results in Error 1305.Error
 ( i.e. verify that the file lib.tar exists and that you can access it), it is an issue with the length of the filepath name. &nbsp;Also, it could be an issue with the&nbsp;
<span>MSXML 4.0</span>&nbsp;installation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here are the steps I took:
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;I created a file folder under my C:/ drive with a very short name (i.e. two letters).</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;I downloaded the CD_English.exe file from PTC's website for Mathcad 14.0. &nbsp;It is under their support page. &nbsp;It is the de-bugged version of Mathcad 14.0. &nbsp;I extracted all of the files into the new file folder with a short name.</div>
<div>3) &nbsp;After download, I opened the PreReq folder and clicked on all of the files shown to install. &nbsp;When you install the msxml file, go through the installation wizard and click on modify. &nbsp;Make sure that the XML SDK option is checked. &nbsp;Finish the installation.</div>
<div>4) &nbsp;Go to the setup.exe file and install Mathcad. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully it will work!</div>

 Windows Vista Compatibility Mode</span></span></a>
<div>
<p>Windows Vista, like any new operating system, will have problems running some older versions of applications. This is especially true in Vista, considering all the changes. Thankfully there is a compatibility mode that can be easily set per application.</p>
<p>To configure the compatibility mode for an application, just locate the installation directory and right click on the .exe, selecting Properties from the menu.</p>
<p>Select the Compatibility tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2008%2f06%2fvista-compatibility-mode.png" /></p>
<p>You can choose to run the program in Windows XP compatibility mode, or even all the way back to Windows 95 compatibility.</p>
<p>Probably the most useful setting&nbsp;to start off with would be to disable the visual themes and desktop composition, if you can’t get things working. If you are trying to run a video game, you will often need to choose “Run this program as an administrator”.
 You’ll have to play around with it, but most likely&nbsp;you can get your application working this way.</p>

<h2>            IMPORTANT&#58; Reinstalling Windows to force Remix OS&#39;s GRUB bootloader off the PC</h2>
                    <p>To Microsoft: (Please help before tomorrow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello. I have an HP 19-2011 All-in-one Windows 10 PC. I downloaded Remix OS on my PC's hard drive (jide.com), and Neverware CloudReady on my USB flash drive (neverware.com). Somehow, CloudReady interfered with Remix OS, including the GRUB bootloader, so
 now, I cannot boot into Windows because GRUB gives this error:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f162eb0-e1a8-4fd4-9c3d-33649b502320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f162eb0-e1a8-4fd4-9c3d-33649b502320" /></a><br />
<br />
I tried using system restore and other troubleshooting options, but they did not help. System Restore gave en error saying the Windows drive was corrupt.<br />
I thought reinstalling Windows with a recovery media would fix the problem, but when I went ahead with installation (formatting Windows all the way), it said the GPT/partitions were not in their recommended order:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/991ca710-be1e-40d2-b8fb-9f44d81242d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/991ca710-be1e-40d2-b8fb-9f44d81242d0" /></a><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5547d473-eb3e-47e6-9149-e5a6f2ce9e98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5547d473-eb3e-47e6-9149-e5a6f2ce9e98" /></a><br />
1: What is this, and should I continue with installation?<br />
2: Will reinstalling Windows entirely also force uninstall Remix OS, it's GRUB, and all its other hidden components?<br />
3: I will install Windows 10 to format the whole drive (I already backed it up in OneDrive), so it would tell me to enter the product key after the installation. Do I need to enter it? If so, how can I find it? (I could not find the paper that contains the
 product key that came with the PC, and again, I cannot enter Windows)<br />

            I did click n my profile for what version of Skype I am using and there wasn't any selection with the word ABOUT. So I don't really know what version I am using.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/14cc82ab-ef06-4868-bf40-29d5623c881d" title="Rocky1944">
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue happens with your sister only, I have to agree with you that the issue might be on her end. As a suggestion, please advise her to try using a different headset (if she's using one) or try to use a headset if she's using the built-in speakers
 of her device and let me know how it will turn out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>
