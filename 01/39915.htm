<h2>            Lab top is freezing and having trouble booting up</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday after booting up my lab top none of my porgrams were in the task bar and when I hovered over it it had the loading wheel. After a couple of minutes a message would appear saying windows is not responding and if I ended the process it would go to
 a black screen. However today it is now having trouble booting to the desktop or &nbsp;it just freezes trying to get to it so now I can't access anything to try and fix it myself.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Ram,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might be facing this issue due to the incompatibility of the graphics card with Windows 10 also. So I suggest you to install the driver software in compatibility mode from the manufacture’s site and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To install in Compatibility Mode, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong><span>executable</span></strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.<br />
b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
c. In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Package Name</span></strong>&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong>&nbsp;tab.<br />
d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for</span></strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows 8.1&nbsp;</span></strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;<strong><span>Double-click</span></strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></p>

            Hi Ric, until Microsoft resolves the bugs and lack of functionality in the new Skype, it would be best to revert to the Classic Skype
<br />
<br />Uninstall that new app before reverting . . .
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

            Greetings,
<br />
<br />Thank you for taking the time to write in today.  My name is David, a Microsoft Independent Advisor and it is my pleasure to assist you today.
<br />
<br />There are many issues with the latest version of Skype including the one you shared.  Along with many issues, the new version is also lacking in many of the features we enjoy with the prvious version of Skype.
<br />
<br />While these bugs are being figured out, I would highly recommend reverting back to the classic version of Skype.  First, please uninstall your current version of Skype and install the classic version and this has been found to resolve the issue.  Hopefully the newer version of Skype will become more stable as these bugs get worked out. 
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />I would also encourage you to provide feedback to the Skype team about this latest update.  The following link will provide details on how to provide feedback: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>

<h3> paploo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 clean install problems &#40;Error Code OxcOOOO225&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I gave my old computer to a friend's kid, and wanted to upgrade it some before I did so. I added a new GPU and power supply and a new SSD and upgraded to Windows 10. Things ran fine, and then it started to get "Watchdog Errors". This happened with my computer
 when I upgraded to Windows 10, I did a clean install and all worked fine. So I first tried to fix it and not have to reinstall everything, in the middle of the repair/recovery the "Watchdog" popped up and restarted the computer. I then tried to do a clean
 install and am unable to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have media for Windows 10 and a disc for Windows 7. When I try to use either one, the same thing happens. When I go to boot from either the USB for Win 10 or the disc for Win 7, after a couple seconds a black or blue (depending on the Windows version)
 pops up with the error code "0xc0000225" saying Windows failed to start and needs to be repaired and that I need to insert the installation disc and click repair. The problem is, the installation media is in and I never get to any window that says "repair".
 I have NO idea what to do now, I have been trying to get this thing to work for over a week and keep running into dead ends. If anyone could help that would be terrific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I cannot get to the desktop, any answer that suggest such is unhelpful.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If that second hard drive which has a backup of your files is connected to the computer, temporarily disconnect it and follow the procedures below to do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have your drivers for your computer downloaded and ready after setup is complete. Important drivers include, Network, Video, Chipset, Wireless/LAN drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done, you will need to boot from the Windows 8.1 disc and do a clean install.</p>

<h2>            After Windows Update, Wi-Fi doesn&#39;t work anymore on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi!
<div>So, as the title say, after an Windows Update when I was sleeping, my wi-fi wouldn't work anymore. When it first happened, I just used system restore to rollback and I had to keep doing it because of the updates. But one day, I went to Europe on a vacation,
 and the restore point was lost. Now, I got no internet anymore on my computer. It's a desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tryed reinstalling my adapter's files and tryed to uninstall ALL the windows updates installed on that day, but to no avail. What should I do to fix this? I've looked everywhere on the internet, and the only thing I got was that it was an Windows
 Defender update issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>João Pedro</div>

            <p>Hello João Pedro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>I understand that you are having an issue&nbsp;of&nbsp;lost connectivity with your Wi-Fi internet connection, but I would like to know some more information for better assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the <strong>make and model of your system</strong>?</p>
<p>2. What do you mean when you say "restore point was lost"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue may arise due to the fact that the Wireless network adapter is corrupted or requires an update which is not getting installed. So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I’d suggest you to&nbsp;rollback to&nbsp;the network adapter drivers on your computer and check if that makes things better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Open Device Manager by clicking the
<strong><span>Start </span></strong>button, clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>System and Security</span></strong>, and then, under
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. In the list of hardware categories, find and expand
 the <strong><span>Network Adapters </span>
</strong>and select the Wireless device driver that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Click the
<strong><span>Driver </span></strong>tab, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Rollback Driver</span></strong>, and then follow the instructions. If you're prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For further information, visit the below mentioned link:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the Rollback is not successful,
</span>please try to completely uninstall the Wireless adapter, and visit your computer manufacturer's website&nbsp;to download &amp; install the latest driver.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back with your results&nbsp;for further assistance, we'll be glad

<h3> workshy  say:</h3>
<h2>            To free up disk space, Outlook Express can compact messages.  This may take up to a few minutes.</h2>
                    Every few minutes the message :<br />
<br />
"To free up disk space, Outlook Express can compact messages.&nbsp; This may take up to a few minutes."<br />
<br />
This is irrelevant for two reasons :<br />
<br />
(1) I do not use Outlook Express, and therefore have no messages to compact.<br />
<br />
(2)&nbsp;I do not need to free up disk space as I am currently using only five per cent of a very large disk.<br />
<br />
Could someone please tell me how I get rid off this very irritating message.<br />

<li>Start the registry editor. <br />
</li><li>Open this key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Identities\{identity}\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express\5.0<br />

    <title>Cursor vibrates without mouse device plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam wasley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor vibrates without mouse device plugged in</h2>
                    <p>My cursor has been moving by itself recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use two USB wireless mouses, that connect to the desktop via USB and the USB connects to keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed both USB devices from the desktop computer, so there should be zero cursor inputs to the system, yet it continues to move by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shutdown the computer and rebooted the desktop without any USB mouse devices, and the cursor continued to move and then stop after 1 or so seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The direction of cursor movement is not consistent, and I have cursor sensitivity on the highest possible, yet the cursor only moves around 10-20 pixels, so this is very small movement. It is very annoying when trying to click on buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both USB mouse devices work fine, verified by use on another laptop computer independently and together, however the cursor on my computer has a mind of its own while no mouses are connected and will not stay still after the cursor has been dragged across
 the screen. Use of a different mouse borrowed from a friend does not remedy this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the latest Windows 10 Home version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deactivating 'Enhance cursor precision' does not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to run a System Restore since the problem has only materialised in the last 24 hours after a Windows and Intel update, yet every System Restore I try fails because of permissions (error code 0x80070005). Windows recommended deactivating any
 anti-virus protection, but I don't use a single anti-malware program short of Windows Defender (if you classify that as an anti-malware program). I successfully initiated the first two troubleshooting methods advised on this webpage:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/error-code-0x80070005/81e4e422-5278-4431-8b09-7cf448c93ea7</p>
<p>
</p><p>But System Restore continued to fail. I then went into Safe Mode and executed System Restore, but this process did not finish and it hung my system, so I restored back to the current system files and settings with the broken cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop has been verified to be on Windows 10 Home version 1709 build 16299.248.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no clue how to find out which Windows version it was upgraded from, but updates have been routine and automated from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have fixed this problem by removing a rogue 'device' in the Control Panel. The device was listed as USB Optical Mouse, however there was, is and continues to be no such USB device connected to the PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Logitech Unifying Receiver is the wireless mouse that I am using. I continue to 'Remove device' on the USB Optical Mouse device on every startup, and it solves the problem. Though annoying, I am content to have a working PC now that I've accidentally
 hung my PC a few times and brought it back to life.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

    <title>Unable to perform Windows 10 Reset of computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marybabcockbf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to perform Windows 10 Reset of computer.</h2>
                    <p>I want to reset my computer, but I get&nbsp;the prompt 'You need 2.64 Gigabytes of space to perform this action'.&nbsp; Then the option to uninstall programs to free up space. I have uninstalled everything I can possibly get rid of, but the amount of space is exactly
 the same as before. I don't understand why I need ANY space free to perform a reset! I only have one drive C:. And I have 2.95 Gig available left. So why won't it use that space? I want to reset because EVERY website I use will inevitably will stop responding.
 Any help is needed! I'm not tech savvy and am afraid to perform any functions for fear of messing things up for good.</p>

<p>I was having issues with ALL sites not responding. Constantly. Facebook, Google, Microsoft. &nbsp;you name it. I was successful at resetting my computer after 48 hours of trying to free up disc space to perform the reset. Which, by the way, was nearly impossible
 to do. So I just started dumping anything and everything I could. Finally, I had enough space to re-set and have had not one 'not responding'...'recover webpage' prompt so far. My windows10 program is lacking in basic options, for example, 'Smart Storage'.
 Not an option. Neither is Disc Clean Up. I can access it, but it does nothing. I don't know if its working now. I'm afraid to look.</p>

<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<h2>            PDP Xbox One Controller Not Button Mapped Properly For Games</h2>
                    Hello friends and friends of friends, I am having a problem with my newly bought PDP Xbox One Controller. Now I assumed that it was just plug, install drivers and play, but apparently I was wrong. To my supersize the controller works but the buttons (A,X,B,Y)
 are not mapped properly, so I decided to download the PDP Xbox One Controller software on the windows store in hopes of editing the buttons myself. Welp it doesn't connect, the software doesn't pickup the controller at all. Can some generous handsome/beautiful
 guy/gal help me out here?

            It is so <strong>hilarious</strong> a naming-things-freely feature even needs users to vote. The guy didn't think about having this feature at the beginning, mush only has the ability to name his/her children "My Child 1", "My Child 2" etc.

<p>There's really no expectation that this will come ever at all, let alone an actual release date.&nbsp; If Microsoft sees enough requests and decides to start working on a feature like this, they will write a reply in the feedback hub app to let everyone know
 that they are going to build it.&nbsp; But right now their latest reply is just "we will consider this".&nbsp; You can check back later to see if they have officially added it to their plans -

<h2>            Someone else is accessing my account</h2>
                    Last year I downloaded my account to a few different Xbox's. I didn't click remember password (I know it was foolish), and now someone has been playin on y Xbox Live account, and I don't know who it is. I messaged the player that whomever was useing my
 account to tell them to stop, but I'm still worried. Is there away to romotely delete my account off of an Xbox that I can't access? Or atleast make the Xbox they are useing to require a password? Please, I've worked very hard for my achievements and on the
 games I play, and I'd rather not delete my account if this player continues to use my profile without my permission.

<p>Best thing to do is re-download it to the console you are using, and change the passwords connected to your WLID aka MS Account. Once it's activly in your possession, it wont be usable elsewhere. One gamertag can't be connected to live in multiple locations.</p>

<p>In addittion to changing you password and security details, take a look at this look to remove any consoles that can remember the password for a account, this should only be your console.</p>

<p>Thank you so much! I was searching on my Xbox, and I found an option that will require a password on all other consoles other than the one I'm useing. Hopefully this will work. If not, I will use the download profile option. But will that also erase all
 progress on my games if they are saved to the hardrive of another console? Most of my achievements were earned on my boyfriend's Xbox as well as mine.</p>

<p>Saved games will stay put until the user actually tells the console to delete them. Achievements are tied to the GT rather than saved games so they're fine too. You may lose some if you've earned some offline and not connected to XBL with said account before
 recovering it as you'll be downloading the last record XBL has of your account. </p>

<h2>            ACPI BIOS Error after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Windows 10 has been working fine on my Dell T7400 Workstation for several years but after the last major update I get the BSOD on boot with ACPI BIOS Error. Auto repair fails over and over but after a restore W10 boots and runs. Now it demands to do the
 update and I am afraid it will start the BSOD again. I will let you know.

            Hi DianaBusolini 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Use this link to reactivate Skype credit - <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit...</a>
<br />
<br />One of the major causes why people don't see reactivate Skype credit is not to use right login ID and password. You should use your Skype ID and password rather than mail ID as mail ID may have more more than one Skype IDs attached.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<span>Hello Skype Administration,</span>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>My Skype credit has become inactive. I have followed the link provided by Skype to reactivate my credit. I have had no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the problems I'm currently facing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is no reactivate command (I'm working from a MacBook).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I tried it on the Desktop and signed in to My Skype Account and the Reactivate command says that I have no money in my Skype Account. Only three days ago I had AUD$10. So where has the money gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To say I'm disappointed with the software is an understatement.</p>
<div><br />
<div>Please help.</div>
<div><br />

</p><blockquote>Hi DianaBusolini <br />
Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />
Use this link to reactivate Skype credit - <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit...</a> <br />
<br />
One of the major causes why people don't see reactivate Skype credit is not to use right login ID and password. You should use your Skype ID and password rather than mail ID as mail ID may have more more than one Skype IDs attached.
<br />
<br />
Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. </blockquote>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed some of the suggestions you made and signed&nbsp; in with my Skype Account. From here I was able to see the Reactivate command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the balance read $0.00. How can this be? Only three days ago I had over AUD$10.00.</p>
<p>I have not made any calls with Skype using the money in the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that you will be able to sort this problem out for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

<p>Hello after 24 hours of trying to figure out what was happening with my Skype Credit I have had success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Collaborators working with Skype need to make it more explicit for non Technologically Advanced citizens; &nbsp;that Skype users have a Skype account which may be different to their Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Itunes&#47;Bonjour&#47;Apple Mobile Device won&#39;t Install even though I&#39;m the Administrator</h2>
                    <p>Since late February I have been unable to reinstall ITunes.&nbsp; It all started when I tried to update it, and it wouldn't work.&nbsp; Ultimately I uninstalled ITunes and tried to reinstall it, but I kept getting this message that&nbsp;the Apple Mobile Device&nbsp;could not
 be installed(?), and that I have to verify that I have sufficient privileges to install.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have:</p>
<p>Ran as the administrator</p>
<p>Made sure that 'everybody', 'my user' and the 'administrator' (pretty much just me) have full access</p>
<p>Turned the User Account Control off</p>
<p>Cleaned up the registry using CCleaner </p>
<p>Used Command Prompt to check the C drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked.&nbsp; I even have went to the ITunes folder where my music is, made myself the administrator, and it still wouldn't work.&nbsp; Recently I uninstalled Quicktime, Bonjour, and the Apple Mobile Device....everything Apple.&nbsp; Still wouldn't work.&nbsp; I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Service 'Bonjour Service' (Bonjour Service) could not be installed.&nbsp; Verify you have sufficient privileges to install system services.".&nbsp; If I hit&nbsp;'ignore', then it'll just&nbsp;do the same thing&nbsp;except replace 'Bonjour' with 'Apple Mobile Device'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a lost.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I have a Hewlett-Packard laptop</p>
<p>HP Pavilion g6 Notebook PC. 64-bit operating system.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>Processor:&nbsp; AMD A4-3305M APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics, 1900 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 2 Locations&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any more information, let me know (and maybe how to get it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm REALLY at a lost.</p>

            <p>I posted my reply because of what you posted; it was incomplete and I thought that you might have missed something:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<em>Recently I uninstalled Quicktime, Bonjour, and the Apple Mobile Device....everything Apple.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There was also:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple Software Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple Application Support (iTunes 9 or later)<br />
On some systems, iTunes might install two versions of Apple Application Support. This is expected. If both are present, be sure to uninstall both versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does not work, follow my advice and contact Apple Support or ask in their community.</p>

<h2>            LifeCam VX 3000 problems</h2>
                    I have a new Gateway computer running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit upgraded from Vista Home Premium 64 bit. I installed a LifeCam VX3000 webcam and installed the LifeCam 3.0 version compatible with Windows 7. I now get a message that "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\KSUSER.DLL
 is not designed to run on Windows or has an error". Life Cam software launches but that error message pops up and when cleared, it says No&nbsp;Webcam is installed on the computer. Do I need a new copy of KSUSER.DLL to fix the problem?

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ksuser.dll issues are caused by issue with Microsoft DirectX.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The ksuser.dll file is one of many files contained in the DirectX software collection. Since direct X is in-built in windows
 7, I would suggest you to run <strong>SFC (System File Checker) scan</strong> on the computer to fix the system
<strong>file errors</strong> on the computer.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To run SFC scan, follow the steps:
<br />
Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start </strong>, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>click
<strong>All Programs </strong>, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span>click
<strong>Accessories </strong>, right-click <strong>Command Prompt </strong>, </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>And then click
<strong>Run as administrator.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow or Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>At the prompt, type
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and hit enter.Once the scan is complete, restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
