            Hi Vlad, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your USB drive is being unmounted midway through Windows loading, or the USB drivers haven't installed correctly. Either way, I've found a couple of possible solutions in the below Apple forums thread. I'll copy one of them below:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"After the BSOD mac will restart to "Start Windows Normally" screen hit Enter To Start Windows Normally
<br />Go to device manager (Start and type devmgmt.msc and hit enter ) and uninstall "unknown device" under "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" Tick "Delete the Driver Software for this device."
<br />
<br />Now go to your Bootcamp folder i.e. BOOTCAMP_5.1.5621 or BOOTCAMP_5.1.5640 and goto Bootcamp &gt; Drivers &gt; Intel
<br />
<br />Now run the file IntelxHCISetup.exe. It will show you the intel usb3.0 setup assistant. do not install or cancel the setup as it will delete the temporary folder in temp
<br />
<br />Now goto Start and type taskmgr.exe and hit enter. It will open up Task Manager.
<br />In that you have to select Intel Installation Framework and type Shift + fn + f10 (While typing don't press the + key coz its a combination :slightly_smiling: ) to open right click menu (by default you cannot get a right click menu unless you finish installing bootcamp fully)
<br />Select "Go To Process", and again press the Shift + fn + f10 key combination to bring up the right click menu
<br />
<br />And then select Open File Location, Now copy the contents of the folder to a new location i.e. by creating a new folder in the desktop or any other location
<br />
<br />After copying the contents of the folder to a new location go to Device manager and right click the Unknown Device and press the Right click key combination Shift + fn + f10 and select Update Driver Software &gt; Browse my computer for driver software and browse for the folder that you created in Step 8 and click next. It will detect the driver and installs it automatically"
<br />

<h2>            How to define contact groups for Windows 10 email client</h2>
                    <p>Bought a new computer with Windows 10. Imported contacts from a .csv file into Outlook.com. Contacts are available to email in Outlook.com and to the email client in Windows 10. Need to define contact groups. Tried adding a new ‚ÄúContact‚Äù containing all addresses
 of the group members. Winows 10 email did not recognize the new ‚ÄúContact‚Äù (though the "Contact" showed in the People App), Outlook.com email used only the address of the first group member. How do I get groups into Windows 10 that are recognized and usable
 by the Windows 10 email client?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Received reply consisting of two questions and answered them in my reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In my further research, I found out:</p>
<p>1. that there are two kinds of Contacts; Windows Contacts and email Contacts. Found instructions how to define the Windows Contact Groups, but supposedly they cannot be seen by the email client.</p>
<p>2. that Contact Groups used to be called Contact List in some versions of Windows and Contact Categories in others. Have to see whether I can find any of these in Windows 10. I think, in my attempts, I would have found something about defining Contact Lists.

<p>

    <title>Differences between Windows 10 32 bit and 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Differences between Windows 10 32 bit and 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please tell me the differences between Windows 10 32 bit and 64 bit?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the process of planning a drive wipe and re-install of Win 10 and I am wondering if 32 bit will work for me.&nbsp; Some favorite older programs will still load and run on 64 bit and others flat out refuse. Even DOS programs. Some DOS oldies like Wolfenstein
 3D still run on the 64 bit platform while others, like the 1st two versions of Descent, will not?</p>

            <p>As with previous releases, Windows 10 is available in 32 and 64-bit architectures. Windows 10 64-bit comes in handy when you need to address 4 GB&nbsp;or more of RAM. In fact, Windows 10 64-bit supports up to 2 TB of RAM, while Windows 10 32-bit can utilize up
 to 3.2 GB. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64-bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32-bit Windows to accomplish some of the same tasks. But you‚Äôre able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things
 like run an Antivirus scan in the background or run multiple VMs, without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64-bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they
 can work.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><em>There is no in-place upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 10 64 bit</em>. The entire process is a
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/clean-install-Windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean install only</a>. Which means, you‚Äôll need to back up your personal files, reinstall software applications and reinstall hardware drivers. Compatibility is a critical consideration if
 you decide to switch to 64-bit Windows 10. You‚Äôll need 64-bit device drivers for any hardware devices. Also, there is no 16-bit subsystem in Windows 10 64-bit, which means, your applications must be 32 or 64-bit only. Also, there is no upgrade path to move
 from the 64 to 32-bit version‚Ä¶clean install only.</p>

<h3> konstantinos loukas  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;FIXED&#93; &#34;Bad Image&#34; error on specific games after installing Windows 10 Creators&#39; Update.</h2>
                    <p>My actual problem began when I installed Windows 10 Creators' Update. Some of my Steam Games launch as intended (ex. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3), but others (ex. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, Dying Light and Metro 2033 Redux) will just display this
 error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCP110.dll may not be suited to run on Windows or it contains a false. Please try reinstalling the application from its base source or try contacting the developer........" and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error only appears on specific games and I do not know what to do to fix it. I tried reinstalling the game and go back to a previous version of Windows 10, but none of this helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if someone knows any possible solutions, write them down below.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Have you tried reinstalling&nbsp; Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 ? <br />
- You can find an installer in one of the games sub-folders. With METRO 2033 this is in&nbsp; sub-folder-&nbsp;
<em>install &gt; vcredist x86 sp1</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I tried reinstalling the game and go back to a previous version of Windows 10, but none of this helped."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- This should not be an issue if you reinstalled a game, but...</p>
<p>When you change versions of Win10 either by installing a version update, rolling back to previous version, or reinstalling Win10,</p>
<p>some games from Steam will require you to run Steams <em>'Verify integrity of game files'</em> tool before they will run.</p>
<p>Possibly a quirk in the games copy protection that sees a new version as a different machine ?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes. That is what I did and solved the issue! Thank you very much, my friend!</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />Since this relates to more technical configurations on Skype , I would recommend to raise this request as well with Microsoft Tech Forum: 
<br /><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />This way you can get help from experts from both forums :). 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

    <title>Cellular option missing after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barwickgreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cellular option missing after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Lenovo Thinkpad 3rd Gen from Windows 7 pro to Windows 10 Pro. I have a Sierra Wireless EM7345 4G LTE adaptor with SIM which worked under Windows 7. Under Windows 10 the device appears fine in device manager and also in Network Connections,
 where it is shown with a red "not connected" cross but strong signal. I have the latest updates and drivers installed. The network diagnostic trouble shooter cannot find a problem and there are no warnings in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But despite the adaptor appearing in the right places and reporting no errors, the cellular option is missing in Windows. How do I get it back please?</p>

<p>I am running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit build 1809</p>

<p>I did as you suggested, although this is the driver I was already using, as I explained I had installed all the latest drivers. Having followed your advice I am now in a worse position than I was before! The device was fine in device

<p>Hi, reinstalling makes no difference. even in compatibility mode. I set it to run in Windows 7 compatibility Mode for all users and installed as Administrator as you suggested. There were no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have already stated, the device was fine in device manager and network adaptors when I migrated from Windows 7, the problem was Windows 10, despite the device being correctly installed, would not allow cellular connection. Having followed your advice
 the device now has a yellow exclamation in device manager with the error "the drivers for this device are not installed (code 28). There are no compatible drivers for this device". Clearly this is untrue because the device was installed without error when
 I migrated from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Networking in Windows 10 generally seems poor, with Aircraft Mode switching itself on for no apparent reason and the computer failing to connect automatically to known networks even though the automatic connection option is selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very disappointed that having followed your advice the situation is worse than it was before.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks again for the reply.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As the driver were removed completely from the computer and you are unable to reinstall them, I would suggest to try system restore and see if the drivers and cellular
 connectivity gets restored.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: System restore will not delete any of your personal files, however the apps and updates installed after the restore
 point was created will be uninstalled. Also any changes to settings make after the restore point was created will be lost. Select the restore point which was created before we uninstalled the drivers.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your response. I carried out a system restore to 26th February, which was before making any of the changes you suggested. This has undone errors in device manger by reinstalling the drivers and I'm back where I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4G LTE devices is installed without errors in device manager and appears without errors in Network Connections. Despite Windows 10 knowing it is there and reporting no errors, the user interface does not offer the cellular connection option.</p>

<p>As I originally explained, the firmware, BIOS and software are up to date. This is clearly a Windows 10 problem in that the device worked perfectly under Window 7 and even&nbsp; Windows 10 shows the LTE modem installed without error in Device Manager and in Network
 Adaptors, Windows 10 just won't allow me to use it even though it shows no errors with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having spent 12 days following your advice around in a circle, I'm now back exactly where I started but the time slot in which I can roll back to Windows 7 has expired. Not a great outcome.</p>

</p><p>Please try updating windows. If this is not working, go the the WWAN manufacturing site or your PC support website and download wireless application. That application can be used to connect to a cellular network but the issue is frequent disconnections.</p>

            Thanks, I'm afraid it didn't help. Windows is up to date. If I uninstall the driver and reinstall it then appears with a question mark in device manager and I have to do a system restore to get it back. It's really odd that the device appears and claims
 to be working correctly in device manager and in Network Adaptors, it's just that Windows doesn't offer any cellular options.

                    Hi, there...Can anybody help me? I have bought an Acer E1-531 with pre-installed Windows 8. After upgrading to Windows 10, the original keys in my BIOS was replaced by a windows 10 keys. Since Windows 10 crashes and it unable to reset my PC bask to factory
 default. I was forced to perform a clean install from Windows 8 DVD, but to no luck, I was asked for a key..no matter how I skip the process, it is always asking for a key. The main problem here is my Windows 8 OEM key was replaced by Windows 10 reserved key.
 Is it the case when We upgrade to Windows 10? Can we recover back the key of the previous version? Please Help

            <p>Hello Edward,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may directly install Windows 10 on the PC. If you have installed and activated Windows 10 on your PC once, it will not ask for activation on the same PC again. Hence a clean install to Windows 10 can be an option for you instead of installing Windows
 8 and upgrading it to Windows 8.1 and then Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the article mentioned below for downloading Windows 10.</span></p>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;It just so happen that I came with a pre-installed Windows 8 on my laptop, I obtain Windows 10 through free upgrades, however my laptop was brought from abroad, that means no local assistance in my area to reset my laptop. I did download through media creation
 tool for Windows 8 Single Language x64, when it prompts me for a key, I suspect that my genuine key is removed from BIOS due to force re-installation e.g Diskpart, when I used an OEM key reader, the only keys embedded in my BIOS is Windows 10, and I am not
 sure what version I got when I upgraded to windows 10. Will my manufacturer embedded keys really be removed in the BIOS when I upgrade to 10?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is incorrect.&nbsp; The WIndows 10 Upgrade does not embed any key in BIOS, but instead records your hardware signature to compare when you wish to reinstall.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Factory OEM Windows 8 and 8.1 always embed the Product Key in BIOS, so during <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clean-install-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Install - Windows 8</a> leave the key blank and it will activate after connecting to internet.&nbsp; The tutorial link is the definitive one on the subject and discusses all activation options in depth.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However until you uninstall Windows 10 by deleting its partition, the Windows 8.1&nbsp; used to Upgrade&nbsp; will not reactivate.&nbsp; To receive assistance, right click the Start button to access an Admin Command Prompt, type
<strong>slui 4</strong> to open an activation box to use telephone robocall to Activate.&nbsp; If it fails stay on the line to speak with agent and explain situation.&nbsp; Report back.&nbsp;

</p><p>The Good news:&nbsp; When it's all done, an HTML file will show up on your desktop labeled "Uninstalled Apps."&nbsp; This file is a list of the apps uninstalled and most (if not all) will be links to the websites to re-download it.&nbsp; This is a good opportunity to ask
 yourself, "Did I really need this?"&nbsp; Because chances are, you didn't/don't anymore.&nbsp; Meanwhile your updates will all have been automatically uninstalled.&nbsp; Oh, and File Explorer will launch and not crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; Cheers!</p>

<p>This really isn't that difficult. &nbsp;Basically one of the updates installed during installation/upgrade was bugged. &nbsp;So, this fix uninstalls that update (as well as the rest of them) if Explorer would work normally, I'd give you a way to uninstall that update.</p>

That blah blah blah is more important than you think. &nbsp;Is there anyway I can talk you into doing this again and taking note of what that issue was? &nbsp;Apparently your situation is more complicated than most.

<p>Scaling down my desktop? No. What I'm suggesting is there is a conflict with either one of the updates that downloads during update/installation or an app that you have installed this essentially gives you a clean install and Explorer works.</p>

<p>I found a solution to the constant Windows 10 file manager crashes. I got rid of One Drive - which lessened the problem immensely a couple of other solutions online elsewhere helped also. Without going to the drastic measure of losing all my apps and having
 to reinstall everything - not to mention I would loss a couple of programs that I use everyday and have to get a programmer in to rebuild them since they are custom made programs for work. The only hangup I have is that every time</p>
<p>windows 10 does an update from microsoft they reinstall One Drive - IF I WANTED THAT PIECE OF CRAP I WOULDN'T HAVE UNINSTALLED IT!!! I now have to go through the entire process of uninstalling it yet AGAIN or I can't work efficiently because your file manager
 crashes every 2 mins! WHEN WILL YOU FIX THIS STUPID BUG!!!! THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ALL OVER THE INTERNET ABOUT IT! &nbsp;- I am seriously going to tell ALL our friends and CLIENTS to go with APPLE if this is not fixed soon.</p>

"Main reason" in the log says that operating system is not compatible with startup (automatic) repair. Im running Windows 10 (10.0.10240) x64 Home SL Turkish and 100% positive about i downloaded correct version from your link.<br />
<br />
At this point, the only solution looks like reinstall OS (or reset), but im happy with my current way. Is there a way to manually download Windows 10 updates just like old versions?</p>

<p>&nbsp;So, I did this and it completed without a problem. After this, i was able to complete "Automatic repair" suggested by Arun BJ too, without an error. But I checked log folder just in case to be sure, it says same thing; that my OS is not compatible with
 repair. Heres the new "Automatic repair" log:<br />

But i didnt get any error while fix happened, so i went back and checked if Windows Update is fine now. Its not. I went and try older solutions again, nothing changed, I still cannot access Windows Update. Its getting more and more complicated, and looking
 back again, no one seems to have fixed this issue (even in this forum). So, yeah.<br />

            Even though you suggested same thing i mentioned in first post, i went ahead and nothing changed. Considering this is fourth suggestion from four different person, and suggestions started to repeat itself, i dont think you read what each others suggested.
 Thanks, Microsoft, for your help and removing Windows Update catalog. <strong>I reseted my computer, and now everything is fine.
</strong>Again, thanks for all the help.<br />

<h2>            ethernet connected internet stopped working</h2>
                    I have had my computer set up in the same room with the same modem and same hard wire connection for a few years now. Just yesterday I turned on my computer to use it and the internet is not being recognized. I have tried reading through the forums to
 fix it myself. With either cmd prompts or driver uninstalls and re-installs but I still cannot seem to solve the issue. I am not sure if my LAN connection on my MB had gone out or not; it's about 5 years old at this point. I have a laptop I am using for research
 about the problem and communication here.&nbsp;

<p>Top right corner, Currently connected to: Unidentified Network, No Internet Access. When I open up network and sharing center, Access type: No Internet access, Connections: Local Area Connection. When I click the red X to for Windows Network Diagnostics,
 Problem found: There might be a problem with the driver and the Local Area Connection adapter. Try repair as Admin, The wired network adapter is experiencing problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a tried quite a few cmd runs using other windows forum discussions and other forums I have found through google searching. I have also updated my Driver for Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet Connection.. as well as uninstall and re-install attempts. I
 used Driver Easy to pull updated driver file using external memory and transferring file from laptop to PC. Xbox one is hardwired into same network and working as well as all my Wifi capable devices on the network. The connection was fine about 3 days ago.&nbsp;</p>

            No, it is on my desktop PC. Running a MSI MS-7821 MB. I am currently using my laptop to trouble shoot and research possible fixes to the problem. My laptop, gf's laptop, smart TV's and phones are all using the wifi without an issue. My xbox one is hard
 wired in at the modem and I do not have a problem with it either. I am just fine with it being an adapter if that's what it is. I'll just buy a new card. I figured I would pass it by the pros before I purchased one.&nbsp;

            This did not solve the problem. It gave me the same error message that "There might be a problem with the driver for the Local Area Connection adapter" which the new new network adapter, Intel Gigabit CT Desktop, has updated drivers... to my knowledge
 at least. It also gave me a new error message "A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken." To trouble shoot this I disconnected my Laptop from wireless connection and plugged the Ethernet cable from my desktop into my Laptop and the internet
 worked just fine hardwired. I am kind lost...What do you think I should try next?&nbsp;

                    Just upgraded to Windows 7 and have thousands of files.&nbsp; Now I've got My Documents under Documents.&nbsp; I have the same files, for the most part, under Admin, My Documents.&nbsp; I cannot tell which is the primary file or how to easily combine them into one place.&nbsp;
 The same thing is true for music and pictures.<br />
<br />
Is there any good way to do this?<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The Libraries were added as a feature in Windows 7 to solve the problem of modern computing where a user may have many gigabytes of documents, pictures, videos, and Music files. The problem is that all of these files can quickly fill up a system drive (C:).</p>
<p>All of these folders can be moved to a separate hard drive or partition and then added to the library on the system (C:) drive for easy access from one central location. A Library is a Virtual Folder that does not use any space on the system drive. They
 provide a 'mirror' of the actual, physical files files and folders.</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;the Admin\My Documents as an example.</p>
<p>The My Documents folder can be added to the Documents Library (or any other library that you create). When you open the Documents Library and open a file there, this opens the actual&nbsp; physical file from the Admin\My Documents folder.</p>
<p>Some things you need to be aware of:</p>
<p>1. If you Delete a folder or file from within a Library, this deletes the physical file.</p>
<p>2. You can use the Remove option in the Library to remove folders that have been added to the Library, without harming the physical folder or the files it contains.</p>
<p>Please see the following links for a complete description about using the Libraries.</p>

            As far as the "primary file" - note that <br />
per user documents are stored in \Users\Username\Documents&nbsp; <br />
all users documents are stored in \Users\Public\Documents<br />
<br />
"My Documents" is a junction point redirecting to the Documents folder and was created for backward compatibility.&nbsp; To get to the most basic view of the files look at the folders above.&nbsp; Then, depending on what you want to do, libraries might be a useful tool.<br />

I can still open them and such, but they refuse to connect to the internet, I've tried troubleshooting problems, though my computer says nothing is wrong and I have also redownloaded both Steam and Spotify to no avail. Both of the programs will open, yet they
 will not connect to the internet even though the internet itself works just fine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, before a week ago, these programs worked just fine, I have no idea what may have happened.</p>
