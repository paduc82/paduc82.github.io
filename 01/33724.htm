    <title>USB Wireless Adapter Can&#39;t Find Networks But Built-in Wireless - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Wireless Adapter Can&#39;t Find Networks But Built-in Wireless Can.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a strange problem. My laptop has built-in wireless G but I bought a wireless N router some time back and I wanted to use it to its full potential so I bought a wireless N expresscard. That started to cause the BSOD because it got really hot and was
 just above my hard drive. Because of this I bought a new USB N adapter which worked fine up until now. I tried to update the software for it and as instructed I uninstalled the previous software first then installed the new software, but since then the adapter
 can't find any networks. It apparently is working fine and it's enabled, but there are no available networks, yet when I switch on the built-in wireless G it finds lots of networks and joins no problem. On top of that I tried my older N1 expressard and that
 is the same as the usb adapter - enabled, working fine (apparently) but no networks.</p>
<p>HELP!</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>System: Acer 5920G, Windows 7 Ultimate</p>
<p>WiFi USB: Hercules HWNUm-300</p>
<p>ExpressCard: Belkin N1 Wireless ExpressCard</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you use the New USB disable in the Network center/Change adapter setting, the other adapters. It is a simple right click and disable, or enable if needed in an other time, on the Adapter icon.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Go over these steps and tell us where the breaking point is.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong></em>If possible configure the Firewall correctly, otherwise totally uninstall it, and get rid of its residual processes
 to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>A message in the Wireless little Window that says Connected does not means that your are really have a valid functional connection.</strong></p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse, be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus.</strong></p>
<p>If it does not connecting to the Router, log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID is On,&nbsp; and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>Enable the Wireless security after you mange to establish a functional connection.</strong></p>

    <title>Windows 7 always tries to connect using the Native WIFI Default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramon300  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 always tries to connect using the Native WIFI Default Profile</h2>
                    
<p>I defined a new WIFI profile for my home WIFI network. I use a&nbsp;NETGEAR WNA3100 USB Adapter. The profile is setup to connect automatically. I also moved it above the Native WIFI Default Profile. Windows 7 always tries to connect to the Native WIFI Default
 Profile and not the profile I created. Also, when I restart Windows 7, the Native WIFI Default Profile moves to the top of the list of profiles. Also, When I try to change the Native WIFI Default Profile to use WPA-PSK (TKIP) security instead of WEP, it lets
 me make the changes but it reverts to WEP after it processes the changes and attempts to connect to the network.</p>
<p>How can I fix this so that&nbsp;Windows 7 will use my profile to connect to my home WIFI network and not the Native WIFI Default Profile.</p>

<p>Hi Praseetha,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying to my post. The steps you outlined did not correct the problem. After removing both profiles and adding the profile for my home network, Win7 added the NativeWIFI Default Profile back automatically. My profile is setup to Automatically
 Connect to the network using WPA-PSK (TKIP) security and the NativeWIFI Default Profile (using WEP security) is setup by Win7 to Manually Connect. Also, Win7 places the NativeWIFI Default Profile above my profile. Also, when I delete the NativeWIFI Default
 Profile, Win7 always puts it back and it goes above my profile.</p>
<p>This is starting to look like the Win7 Manage Wireless Networks mechanism for allowing users to add and prioritise profiles is not working.</p>
<p>Here is another thing that is happening: When I try to change the security for the NativeWIFI Default Profile to WPA-PSK (TKIP) from WEP, Win7 lets me&nbsp;make the changes but it reverts to WEP after it processes the changes and attempts to connect to the network.
 This too seems to me that is a problem with Win7. If I could make this work, then I don't need to define a second profile.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers,<br />
<br />
<strong>Choose let me pick from a list , Click on Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.<br />
</strong><br />

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for thinking about this and replying.</p>
<p>I was told by NETGEAR that I have the latest driver for the adapter. The adapter is working properly and I am using it with no problems.</p>
<p>The issue I have is with Win7 and the&nbsp;"Manage Wireless Networks" interface. It will not honor the fact that the WIFI profile I created for my home network should be connected to automatically as I have setup. It always wants to connect to the NativeWIFI
 Default Profile even though I setup my home network profile to Connect Automatically. I can do a manual connection to my home network with no problem.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is a Win7 issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Ramon 300,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did have the same concern with my Netgear adapter installed on a Windows 7 Operating System. Here are the&nbsp;steps I performed and hopefully it can also resolve the issue you are experiencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;perform "msconfig" on the search programs and files box.</p>
<p>&gt;click on the start-up tab, uncheck the netgear wireless adapter(utility)&nbsp;then restart your computer.</p>
<p>&gt;remove the&nbsp;NativeWIFI Default Profile and add your wireless network manually again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;option would be to uninstall the Netgear driver and re-install it. During re-installation, choose "use stand-alone driver" this will activate the built in windows wifi utility instead of the&nbsp;Netgear wireless utility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>note: before you uninstall the driver make sure that you still have the set-up disc of your wireless adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully the steps given above may help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raven</p>

            I had the same problem, after I changed routers.&nbsp; It wanted to continue to connect to my old router.&nbsp; I went round and round like you did until I looked at another thread.&nbsp; They suggested checking the Netgear site, which I did, and was also no help.&nbsp; But
 it made me think, do I have a Netgear utility, and yes I did.&nbsp; So I created the correct profile in the Netgear utility, then deleted the old incorrect one.&nbsp; Now my new router is the NativeWIFI default profile, so when the computer boots up, it connects automatically.&nbsp;
 Hope this works for you too.

<h2>            Why 5 partitions</h2>
                    <p>I bought a surface pro 3 online from the store about 12 months ago. Zero problems, very happy. Running Win10, because was a "refurbished" one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I was using it to help me troubleshoot my desktop machine. I noticed in "disk management" that it has one physical drive with ....5....partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not remember configuring it like this. Just don't understand the logic of it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Partition 1, 360 MB Healthy (Recovery Partition)</li><li>Partition 2, 200MB Healthy (System partition).....ok, so this is initial "booting" area.</li><li>&nbsp;(No "partition" number) Windows (C:) 1112.18 GB NTFS, Bitlocker, Healthy (boot, page, crash, dump, primary), ok.....standard.<br />
</li><li>Partition 5, 844 MB, Healthy Recovery Partition (hmmm)</li><li>Partition 6, 5.57 GB, Healthy Recovery Partition (what??)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>and why is either the numbers&nbsp;3 or 4, skipped?&nbsp;I'm guessing something to do with when created, one was created then deleted, without backing out all the way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would have been done during imagining......would it not?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>

</p><p>We understand that this may be causing confusion regarding the partition drives. Some drives are meant to be hidden, as they contain system files and this files are not meant to be accessed. Touching these hidden files may cause your system to get corrupted.</p>

            <p>That is a webpage not a browser. Are you using MS Edge ? if so go to More (3 dots top right), select settings and then Start with a specific page or pages. Select custom and then type in www.google.ca and press return. Close the browser and start it again.
 It should now open with google.ca.</p>

<h2>            How to get computer to read the Windows 8 disc&#63; It won&#39;t load and nothing happens.</h2>
                    How do I get windows 8 to read the disc? I placed the disc into the tray and nothing happens. In the good old days it would automatically read it and give me options. I am electronically challanged. I called the Microsoft support line 800 936-5700. When
 asked (ugh automation) if i was calling about windows 8 I was instantly disconnected. Any help appreciated. Thanx

            <p>If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows then&nbsp;it supports&nbsp;a maximum of&nbsp;4Gb of RAM and some of that will not be accessible to the OS, depending on how much of the hardware, such as video, has to be mapped into memory. To access all of the memory available
 you would have to move to a 64-bit Windows OS. </p>

<h2>            Computer stuck on resume&#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I closed my computer using the hibernation feature. Now all it does when I press the power button is light up but the screen remains black and nothing happens besides me knowing that it's powered on... It has always been working fine and I'm just stumped.
 I tried to force shut down multiple times, disconnecting everything, but it's still just a black screen(I'm actually wondering if the screen even turns on)... I can't really do anything very fancy and I need help ideally pretty fast, I just don't know what
 I'm supposed to do... I may have missed details 'cause I'm very stressed out, I'll gladly answer any questions to help understand my problem

            It might be hardware related issue, I suggest contact your PC manufacturer's support , in some case you might do power reset, meaning turn off your PC and unplug it and press power button for few second and then turn it on but it is better to contact their
 support.

<p>I wanted to know why Printmaster was not compatible with Windows 10 </p>
<p>I would like to know why it is NOT. Why ??? It is one of the best programs of its kind as to ease of working with It.&nbsp; What is wrong with Microsoft and&nbsp;Broderbund getting this UPDATED.?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GG&nbsp;

            That game is not backwards compatible.&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360&nbsp; So it will only play on an Xbox.

<p>Hey there Rab14 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like this error code could be coming up for one of the following reasons
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The game isn’t supported on the Xbox 360 console.</li><li>You have a storage device other than an official Xbox 360 Hard Drive.</li><li>You don’t have all the necessary Xbox 360 console software updates.</li><li>Game saves from an original Xbox console can’t be transferred to an Xbox 360 console.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When checking for updates on the Console, Follow "Solution 7" on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console/system-update-help#4123f879a7fd4b8a98ccf91bfa1ab2c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to update your Xbox 360</a>. </p>
<p>This will rollback all updates and reinstall the latest update on the Console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

<p>Is it a Retail, OEM System Builders or OEM preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.) license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OEM preinstalled license,&nbsp;product key finders programs do nor find a product key that is useable for re-installation purposes.</p>
<p>For that you need the product key from the COA sticker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OEM preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.) license:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker, which has the Product Key on it,&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

<p>Hi Howard Lawson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you try to connect the camera?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From visiting the Canon website I got to know that drivers are not required for Canon PowerShot SX30 IS on Windows 7 operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sx30_is#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sx30_is#DriversAndSoftware</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestion for a possible fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> First let’s check if the camera gets detected in Device Manager:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>device manager</b> in the
<b>Start</b> search box and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate and expand <b>Universal Serial Bus Controllers</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the camera appear here?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, let’s check for the status of the same.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the camera and select
<b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under <b>General</b> tab, check for the status of the webcam under
<b>Device status</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it show any error message/code associated with the camera? If yes, let us know the exact error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> The following article has solutions to some common problems with connecting a camera to a computer:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to run the automated troubleshooting services and check if that helps in fixing the issue.

    <title>Windows 8 , how to share folders through dlna - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 , how to share folders through dlna</h2>
                    My tv can play videos over dlna.&nbsp; The files are organized into genres and are on external hard drives attached to my PC.
<br />
I don't want to share them through the Media player as it clutters the tv with useless folders and views the videos as a large list.&nbsp;
<br />
I want to:<br />
Remove the Guest account device broadcast so it doesn't show up on my tv as a device<br />
Remove the Media library so it doesn't show up on my tv as a device<br />
Share the files in the folders on the external drives through dlna without copying them to my c: drive (my c:\ isn't large enough)<br />
I had this all working under XP so i'm sure it's possible.<br />

            <p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If&nbsp;you don't&nbsp;not want to use Windows Media player then will have to use a different program. Computer server software must be installed on the computer to share files using DLNA.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please search for a DLNA software online and share it with us. This would help other community members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

            I believe that the DLNA service and the windows Media player are not the same item.&nbsp; Windows Media Player simply uses DLNA when broadcasting.&nbsp; if that is true i should be able to switch Media player off and still use DLNA.<br />
<br />
Is my assumption correct ?<br />

            <p>For DLNA, you don't need Media Player, or any other media handling software at all if you are knowledgeable enough about home networks. &nbsp;I just set up my network, selected the folders I wanted to share, and who to give access to. &nbsp;The tricky part is figuring
 out what format the files need to be in order to stream them to each device. &nbsp;My blu-ray player (Panasonic) requires .vob format. &nbsp;If you are lucky enough to already have the files in the needed format, your work is mostly done. &nbsp;If not, you may need to convert
 them first. &nbsp;Make it easy on yourself by trying a file first to make sure it works. &nbsp;But back to the point, no. &nbsp;You don't need special software for DLNA. &nbsp;All the software does is try to make it easier for users to do what the OS is already capable of doing
 on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>

<p>on my Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already installed windows 10 update on my alienware desktop with 8.1 and had no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only difference that I see in the two is the laptop is on wifi but it still has 19 Mbps so speed should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Every thing looks good on the download it's just the install that fails. Got to 97% and then stopped and reverted back to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I have noticed is every since I started trying to upgrade my camera light has been on. Not sure why it would be on ? I have also disabled my antivirus and tried to install with no change.</p>

<h2>            ASUS T300 CHI Touch Screen does not work in windows 10 for driver problems</h2>
                    <p>I was in Windows 10 Insider Program so, when build 1809 came out, it was installed on my wife's ASUS T300 CHI. For some strange reason since that moment "HID compliant touch screen" disappeared from "Device manager" and an "Unknown USB Device (device descriptor
 request failure (Code 43)" appeared instead.</p>
<p>I rolled back soon to 1803 but Touch Screen remain in the condition I just described.</p>
<p>ASUS does not supply Touch Screen specific drivers. They say it should use Microsoft HID compliant touch screen drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the the device is completely unusable as a Tablet.</p>
<p>The only way I have to work with it is to take remote control from another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw many people have similar problems but no suggested solution worked for me.</p>

    <title>Does BF4 look better when output in 720p &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skorba71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does BF4 look better when output in 720p &#63;</h2>
                    After reading everything about the Xbox One upscaling non 1080p games to 1080p, many people say BF4 looks better when the Xbox One outputs in 720p instead of 1080p, since this bypasses the upscaler altogether. All that higher contrast / crushed black stuff.
 Can anyone confirm? I currently output at 1080p and set my video to RGB full (my TV supports both.) At work now, will try it when I get home. Just wondering if anybody that has tried it sees any difference, not just in BF4 but in any non 1080p game that uses
 the upscaler. Thanks!

<p>BF4 isn't 1080P on the Xbox One or the PS4.&nbsp; So, even though it isn't 1080P, it is more than 720P (more like 900P).&nbsp; So reducing your console's resolution would not make the game look better.&nbsp; It looks its best at 1080P.<br />
<br />
So far, the only game I've seen on the Xbox One look better in 720P is Call of Duty Ghosts.&nbsp; In Ghosts they used some kind of sharpening filter on the Xbox One, but I think it looks rather horrid.&nbsp; If you play the game in 720P, this filter doesn't show.</p>

<p>It would depend on whether your TV is full HD 1080p or not. If it is, then that game is 900p native, so setting it to 720 means the Xbox is downscaling the image. If you then feed it to a Full HD TV, the scaler in the telly will have to upscale it back to
 1080 again. In other words, its carrying out a ton of unnecessary steps which would usually result in increased lag and an overall worse image.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What would be interesting is if the X1 as a setting to output in a Native mode? (I don't have one yet so can't answer) but that would then mean your x1 outputs in whatever resolution the game devs picked. Which gives you the option of flicking between native
 and 1080 on the X1 settings and seeing which scaler is better, your TV's or the one built into the console. Though unless your TV is pretty new and reasonably high end, the chances are that the built in one on the console will likely be better quality.</p>

<p>Hey Siona thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First things first&nbsp; we suggest trying to clear the game cache (clear local saved games) as well to make sure there isn't any corruption on the installation file.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>How to clear Game Cache on the Xbox One:</p>
<p>Settings</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>Storage</p>
<p>Clear Local Saved Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes and Restart&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IF THE CONSOLE IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET</strong> no progress or purchase data will be lost, since the game progress and purchases are linked to the cloud. What we accomplish by doing these steps would be to resync the profile to the cloud getting
 rid of any corruption as a byproduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give these steps a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other issues or inquiries!!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi jackmay52,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Desktop Window Manager Session Manger is a service used for desktop appearances. You may check if the service is running
 correctly and if not you can start the service and then check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 services.msc in the search box</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Search
 for Desktop Window Manager</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the service set to Automatic and started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Then
 check if the aero theme works properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I tried your recommendation several times with no success.</p>
When I open Desktop Window Manager Session Manager Properties (Local Computer), I see that Startup type is already on Automatic, and Service status is already Started. Even tried to stop and start the service from the left pane. Still same response: lots of
 screen flashing, but no change in background.&nbsp; Also discovered that I <em><strong>can</strong></em>readily change Window Color and screen savers.<br />
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hello Jackmay53,</p>
<p>Please follow the following instructions to verify if this assists you with your issue.&nbsp; In addition, if you would please verify the version of Windows 7 that you are running, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Open Control Panel &gt; Ease of Access Center &gt; Make the computer easier to see.</p>
<p>Under "Make things on the screen easier to see"&nbsp; Please ensure that all of these options are unchecked.&nbsp; Specifically "Remove background images".</p>
<p>-Attempt to create an alternate user account and verify if you are able modify your background successfully</p>
<p>-Open the Command Prompt and type "SFC /scannow"&nbsp; Below are some additional steps for this issue.</p>
<p>The problem could be with the Themecpl.dll. First of all use the System File Checker tool (Sfc.exe) to see if there's any corrupted component on your system:<br />
<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a><br />
<br />
If Sfc reports no errors, open Registry editor (Regedit.exe) and export this registry key to a text file (select the key, click<strong>File</strong>,
<strong>Export</strong>):<br />
<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{ED834ED6-4B5A-4bfe-8F11-A626DCB6A921}<br />
<br />
Then post here the content of the text file&nbsp;so that we can take a look.</p>
<p>If you would please follow up with me at your earliest convenience, I would greatly apprecaite it.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp; Have a great day.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>

<p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>When I opened Make the computer easier to see, All 3 High Contrast options were checked. I unchecked them, applied, and tried to select "Think Theme". Same&nbsp; result.</p>
<p>I created a new user account and verified I was able to modify the background successfully.</p>
<p>Returning to my personal account (which is also an administrator account, opening the cmd window, I typed SFC /scannow. It returned:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]<br />
&nbsp;Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.&nbsp; All rights reserved.<br />
&nbsp;C:\Users\Jack May&gt;SFC /scannow<br />
&nbsp;You must be an administrator running a console session in order to<br />
&nbsp;use the sfc utility.<br />
&nbsp;C:\Users\Jack May&gt;</em></p>
<p>When I ran SFC /scannow from administrator user, no problems were found.</p>
<p>Returning to personal user account, follow the directions in 929833 Which has me run sfc /scannow as administrator (Didn't I just do that?)</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;C:\Windows\system32&gt;sfc /scannow<br />

&nbsp;Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</em></p>
<p>When I enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;c:\&gt;findstr /C:"[SR] Cannot repair member file" %windir%\logs\cbs&nbsp;\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt</p>
<p>I get a c:\&gt;&nbsp; I interpret this as no problem found.</p>

<p>Hello Jack,</p>
<p>Thank you for following up with me on this information.&nbsp; Please proced with the support steps listed below.&nbsp; If you would please follow up with me at your convenience, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>In the first case, where any update or program disables changing wallpaper, you can edit the registry to be able to change desktop background. Use the following steps to edit the registry:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> to open the Run dialog;</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Regedit</strong> in the Run dialog to open the Windows 7 Registry Editor;</p>
<p>3. Look for the key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\ActiveDesktop</p>
<p>4. Look for <strong>NoChangingWallpaper</strong> in the right pane. If the value is<strong>1</strong>, it means some update or program changed the value so that you cannot change the desktop background. Right click on<strong>NoChangingWallpaper,
</strong>click <strong>Modify</strong>, and change the value to<strong>0</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Close the registry and reboot.</p>
<p>You should now be able to change the desktop background. If the value was not <strong>
1</strong> in registry editor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk</span></p>

    <title>Photo Gallery Ratings Change File Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m whiteside  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery Ratings Change File Size</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Photo Gallery 2012 Build 16.4.3528.331 on Windows 8.1 Update 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently noticed that when using the star rating system,&nbsp;Photo Gallery&nbsp;changes the file size of images</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example </p>
<p>When viewing a folder of images, I select View &gt; All Details, this lets me see several images
</p>
<p>I can then&nbsp;easily click a rating for a file</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>When I click&nbsp;a rating, the file size in MB listed above, changes downwards, sometimes by quite a lot. The issue seems to manifest in larger images from a DSLR. Small pictures &lt;8 Megapixel seem to have no change, moderate file sizes (taken with a 12 Mega
 Pixel DSLR) have a small effect and larger files taken with a 24 Mega pixel camera have a significant change. To be clear I'm not re-saving or doing anything other than clicking a rating.&nbsp;I can only assume Windows Photo Gallery is resaving as a more compressed
 JPEG but this worries me, as I'm not asking it to do this. All I'm doing is rating files.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know what causes this and can anyone else replicate it.</p>
<p>If this continues I will switch away from Photo Gallery as I can't afford for it to be modifying files without request,</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and unfortunately nobody has yet answered the issue, including Microsoft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 and use Photo Gallery 2012.&nbsp; When using the Rating facility, I get the same problem of a reduction in the size of the JPEG file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My JPEG files are smaller than M Whiteside (above) as I'm not using a DSLR camera.&nbsp; Sometimes I also switch to a lower resolution in order that the files can be more easily sent or uploaded. So my JPEG files are usually between about 3MB to 8MB, occasionally
 more. But with all of these files, there's a reduction in size when I use the Rating facility, between about 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest reduction proportionately (%) is with the smaller files.&nbsp; Those at about 3MB reduce by around 20%, and larger files at 8MB reduce by about 10%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pity that nobody yet has an answer or possibly a solution.</p>

            <p>Have you tried doing a comparison between the files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ie Open one, invert the colours. Open the modified version and paste on top of the first one in Subtract mode. You should get an image where all pixels are perfectly black. Anything else would indicate a change in the image.</p>
