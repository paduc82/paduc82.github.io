    <title>Change Win10 ownership from personal to organisation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change Win10 ownership from personal to organisation</h2>
                    <p>When we set up our initial Win 10 Pro machines we selected "owned by (personal)" at setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we've grown a lot and adopted AzureAD and InTune. I know we can add those old machines to AzureAD by doing a workplace join, but I want to make them owned by the organisation, so that any of our users can log into them, just like our newer machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do that?</p>

            Hi Marsh,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Browse the following path:
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
<br />
<br />On the right,key look for the RegisteredOwner String Value. 
<br />
<br />If you don't have the string, you'll need to create it:
<br />
<br />Right-click on the CurrentVersion (folder) key, select New, and click on String Value
<br />
<br />Name the new String Value RegisteredOwner and press Enter
<br />
<br />Double-click the RegisteredOwner String Value and enter the organization name
<br />
<br />
<br />On the right,key look for the RegisteredOrganization String Value. 
<br />
<br />If you don't have the string, you'll need to create it:
<br />
<br />Right-click on the CurrentVersion (folder) key, select New, and click on String Value
<br />
<br />Name the new String Value RegisteredOrganization and press Enter
<br />
<br />Double-click the RegisteredOrganization String Value and enter the organization name
<br />
<br />Once done, close the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Check that dialog to make sure the change(s) have taken effect . . .

            Thanks I tried this, and while it changed the internal ownership of the machine, it doesn't allow any user to log in, as with our machines joined to Azure AD from setup. Any guidance as to how that might be achieved would be welcome.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I understand the inconvenience that you have to go through due to this issue. It must be very infuriating to see all those changes after Windows Update and not being able to find your important data. However, we will work
 together and will try to recover those data and prevent this from happening again.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue appears to be caused due to user profile not working on&nbsp;the Computer had created a new temporary profile at that point of time. Since the temporary profile is a new profile but with the same user name possibly you continued to work in the
 new profile considering it to be your original profile. The original user profile started working and you are currently signed-in in your original profile and probably that’s the reason you are not able to find your data that you worked on between this periods.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><span>As the result, many times the files that the logged on user profile has also get corrupt. When this happens, every time the user tries to log on to the computer using the username and password, the profile fails to load.
 This enforces Windows 8&nbsp;to create a new temporary profile to allow the user to log on to the computer. This temporary profile is also automatically deleted as soon the user logs off. Every time the user attempts to log on to the computer and the default profile
 fails to initialize, a new profile is created at each successful logon and gets deleted while logging off.<br />
<br />
Although with the help of such temporary profile the user is allowed to log on to the computer and is allowed to access the resources that the system contains, the user cannot access the files that were stored at the user’s private locations such as user’s
 Desktop, My Documents, etc.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><span>We can look for this new temporary user profile in user profile folders on local drive and see if we can locate the temp profile over there which would have the same name suffixed with .temp, .bak or something. If we are
 able to locate this folder, there are chances that we can recover all those files that were created. However, it cannot be guaranteed because in most cases the temporary profile gets deleted on logoff.</span></span></p>

            If the CPU overheated, then there's a problem with how the cooler is working.&nbsp; Please check and see if:<br />
- the cooler has adequate thermal compound to transfer heat from the CPU to the cooler<br />
- the cooler is firmly and squarely seated on the CPU<br />
- the cooler is free of dirt/dust/furballs<br />
- the fan on the cooler is working<br />
- there is adequate cool airflow around the cooler<br />
<br />

A lot of people have complained about problems with PCTuneUp.&nbsp; Please uninstall it until we're done testing.<br />

            I agree with usasma on this one, if you identified thermal issues with the processor, you should resolve these before running another stress test.<br />

<h2>            No screen saver after logoff</h2>
                    With Windows XP, after I logged off a screen saver would come on.&nbsp; With Windows 7 I now notice that after I logoff my screen saver does not come on.&nbsp; Is there anyway to have this happen?<br />

<p><span>Hi Mike Stevens,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think you have installed some third party screen saver. If yes, then contact its support team to check if it is compatible with
 windows 7. Usually windows screen saver will not work after you log off your computer.
</span></p>

Hi Foster,</p>
<p>Is it happening only with Google website or with other websites as well?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to apply the hotfix by visiting the link below that should fix the issue that you’re facing with.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The hotfix is applicable to Internet Explorer 7 and not for Internet Explorer 8.</p>
<p><strong>FIX: Certificate error when you try to visit an SSL Web site by using Internet Explorer 7: "There is a problem with this website's security certificate"<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954312</strong></a></p>
<p>If you’re using Internet Explorer 8, follow the steps below in order to get past the security certificate error</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Open Internet Explorer and verify that the page you are trying to view is listing a certificate error.<br />
2.&nbsp;To clear the certificate error go to Tools --&gt; Internet Options from the menu of IE 8.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on the Advanced tab and scroll down to the security section. Clear the boxes for: "Check for publisher's certificate revocation" and "Check for server certificate revocation".<br />
4.&nbsp;Click Apply and Ok.<br />
5.&nbsp;Attempt to reload the page by clicking the Refresh button at the end of the address bar or by pressing the F5 key. Your page should now load as expected.</p>
<p>Also, what is the exact error message when you try to configure the internet time settings?</p>
<p>Post your results back.<br />

<p>I'm signed up to preview new updates, and since the most recent one my mix amp pro has been going haywire.&nbsp; The lights flicker and the audio continues to cut in and out.&nbsp; When I shut off my Xbox One it stops doing it.&nbsp; I also plugged it into my computer
 without issue.&nbsp; This has to be due to the new update, since it was working perfectly yesterday prior to the update.</p>

<p>Okay, so I think I've figured it out. &nbsp;The Xbox One USB port isn't supplying enough power to use the mix amp. &nbsp;Use an alternative power source (i.e. a usb plug, or a computer). &nbsp;This is associated with the most recent Xbox One update. &nbsp;Xbox needs to fix
 this issue.</p>

            Hi Luis
<br />
<br />Is there any particular reason why you have not upgraded to Windows 10 1809 yet? 
<br />
<br />Try upgrading to that release if you can to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If the problem persists I might suggest to try to obtain a user mode dump which has the potential to pinpoint the cause.
<br />
<br />You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.
<br />
<br />If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time explorer.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]
<br />"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\
<br />00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00
<br />
<br />
<br />After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />More info on collecting user-mode dumps:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181</a>(VS.85).aspx
<br />
<br />To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]
<br />
<br />You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.

<h2>            How do I repair windows7 sp1 that gives me an error 7001</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilian laptop running windows 7 sp1 and my profile does not function.&nbsp; Other accounts are fine and my profile works in safe mode.&nbsp; I get the error 7001 every time I try to start a program or do anything.&nbsp; I have tried system restore an it
 will not complete but hangs up. &nbsp; I tried my system repair disk with the same results I do not have a recent backup copy.&nbsp; I believe the problem has to do with a dependancy on the COM file for the&nbsp; windows server to run.&nbsp; How do I fix this or how can I reload
 windows 7 without buying it.&nbsp; Windows 7 came preloaded when I bought the laptop.

            <p>Hi, <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for the post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
It looks that your account profile does not work properly in Windows 7 as you are unable to use the programs in this profile. I appreciate the efforts which you have put to get the issue resolved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the troubleshooting methods given here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Boot the computer to safe mode and perform the below mentioned steps.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to know How to back up and restore the registry
 in Windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</a>
</p>
<p><br />
Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup&nbsp; programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you boot to safe mode perform the steps given here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
b) On the <strong>View menu</strong>, click to select the <strong>Show hidden devices</strong> check box.<br />
c) Double-click <strong>Non-Plug </strong>and <strong>Play Drivers</strong>.<br />
d) Double-click <strong>NetBIOS </strong>over <strong>Tcpip</strong>.<br />
e) In the <strong>Device usage </strong>box, click <strong>Use this device </strong>
(<strong>enable</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you restart the system, the server may take longer to restart. If this behavior occurs, go to the following registry key:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>HKey_Local_Machine/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/Netlogon/DependOnService
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double-click <strong>DependOnService</strong> and in the multi-string editor add the following value (if it is not already present):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LanmanServer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Place the computer in Clean boot and check for the issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Please follow the Step 3 after you are done with all the steps to Reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this resolves your issue, please write to us if you have any other Microsoft issue related to Windows.

    <title>Windows XP Print Spooler Error Code 1068 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joegabriele  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Print Spooler Error Code 1068</h2>
                    I have a print spooler error code 1068. <br />
The fault has just occurred today 28/04/2012<br />
I have been using a Canon MP240 printer for the past 4 years.<br />
The print Spooler is set to automatic.<br />
I have followed the instructions given and I have the following error messages<br />
The Dependency Service or Group Failed to Start. <br />
This message is shown in LexBceS &amp; Fax <br />
I am using Microsoft Windows XP, <br />
Home Edition, <br />
Version 2002,<br />
Service Pack 3<br />

            As I wrote when <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-hardware/print-spooler-missing-out-of-services/a43305fe-1438-4c8c-9969-a39e5a80ab8c#last">
you posted this identical question at the end of an outdated thread</a><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-hardware/print-spooler-missing-out-of-services/a43305fe-1438-4c8c-9969-a39e5a80ab8c#last">
</a>--<br />
<br />
I really don't know what "instructions given" you may have followed.&nbsp; There are a lot of "instructions" in the old thread.<br />
<br />
It's also important to give the complete text of any error messages rather than paraphrasing as you have done.<br />
<br />
All I do know is that you have a Canon MP240 printer that is not working because the Print Spooler isn't running.&nbsp; And the reason that the print spooler isn't running is most likely because you at one time had a Lexmark printer (or a Dell badged Lexmark printer)
 and and that printer was improperly uninstalled.<br />
<br />
I don't know if your Canon printer ever worked and if it did, what happened just before it stopped working.<br />
<br />
You might have noted that I asked several questions of the person who originally asked a question back last November.&nbsp; You might have answered them yourself in order to save time.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>Please provide the complete error message.<br />
<br />
Do you now or did you ever have a Lexmark or Dell-badged Lexmark printer installed?<br />
<br />
What happened just prior to the printer ceasing to work?<br />
<br />
And what version of Windows is installed, including service pack? [You did answer this one; thanks.]
</blockquote>
<br />
I also don't know if you have a fax modem with which you want to use Windows XP fax services.&nbsp; I ask this question because when you paraphrased the error message you received, you mentioned "Fax."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Normally, the Fax service depends on the Print Spooler service, rather than vice versa.&nbsp; If the Print Spooler service fails to start, then the Fax service will also fail to start, so I expect that you might have seen two separate error messages. .... But I'm
 just guessing.<br />
<br />
To save time -- and with the caveat that this is based on guessing the answers that you have not yet provided -- the following will probably restore your printing capability.&nbsp; You
<br />
<p>Often, but not always, the symptoms you described are caused by a corrupt print job stuck in the queue or a corrupt printer driver.&nbsp; However before cleaning things up, on general principles you might want to download, install, update, and run full scans
 with each of these two free programs:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMailware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
Don't run both scans simultaneously.&nbsp; Each will take some time, so start it and then go do something else for a while.<br />
<br />
<b>Clean up printers</b></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>:&nbsp; If after completing step A the print spooler still does not stay running after you have issued the "net start spooler" command, you will not be able to follow all of the steps in "Article One."&nbsp; Use the Special Procedure for Lexmark printers
 described below and then follow Article One.&nbsp; If still no joy, use the alternative method linked below.</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Clean out the pending print jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)</li><li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop spooler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; del /Q "%windir%\system32\spool\PRINTERS\*.*"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start spooler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exit<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp; Clean out the old printer drivers and install the latest drivers using the directions in
<a href="http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article One</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Special Procedure for computers that have or had a Lexmark or Dell-badged Lexmark printer.</b></p>
<p>Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)</p>
<p>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc config spooler depend= RPCSS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>note that there is no space before the =</p>
<p>If you want to use a Lexmark or Dell-badged Lexmark printer after doing the above, you'll have to reinstall it.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; We couldn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get your latest saved data.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having this problem for a week now. Whenever I go to Netflix on my Xbox one, it says, "We can't get your latest saved data." Then it gives me the option to try again or use offline. When I click try again, it says the same
 thing. When I click use offline, it says, "You must be signed into Xbox Live to use Netflix." When I sign in, it says that my account has a problem and that I need to go to
<a href="http://www.account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.account.live.com</a>&nbsp;which is what I did.</p>
<p>Every time I get on my Xbox one, it says this. I went in settings and my network is fine. I don't know what the problem is and I see other people are having the same problem. I can't unplug my router because I have other people in
 my family that use the Internet.</p>
<p>I paid a lot for this Xbox and I don't know if I should just return it or not. When will this problem be solved?</p>

<p>Hello, saramarieoa </p>
<p>I am here to help to you out :) I have a troubleshoot in mind that you can try, would you let us know it works please? Thank you.

<p>Go to Settings&gt;Remove Accounts and then remove the profile that you are currently using.
</p>
<p>Then go back to the hompage, go to the Settings Tab</p>
<p>Instead of clicking on All Settings, click on Restart Console</p>
<p>When the console reboots, re-add your account back onto your Xbox One. </p>
<p>If you don't know how to add your account onto the Xbox One, you can click on this link.

    <title>Why does Microsoft say &#34;Windows XP Service Pack 3 &#40;SP3&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theantibob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft say &#34;Windows XP Service Pack 3 &#40;SP3&#41; includes all previously released updates for the operating system,&#34; when SP1 is required to run the upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Is Microsoft intentionally misleading customers and advanced users by giving the impression that ServicePack3-ISO-9660 CD Image is all that is required to update a clean installation of WindowsXP to SP3?<br />
<br />
ServicePack3's Download page says:<br />
"

Windows® XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) includes all previously released updates for the operating system. This update also includes a small number of new functionalities, which do not significantly change customers’ experience with the operating system.
...<br />
System requirements
<p><strong>Supported Operating Systems:</strong> Windows XP Home Edition , Windows XP Professional Edition, Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2</p>
"
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No where on the page does it mention SP1 or SP2 being required to update to SP3.</p>
<p>Only by reading the white paper can one obtain that information directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When querying Microsoft's Download Center, Knowledge Base and Windows Update, SP1a is repeatedly referenced, and links to the download page made available.</p>
<p>SP1a's functionality has been eliminated by Microsoft's removal of the update files from their servers. Why is this package still being offered to end-users while Microsoft is aware it does not function?</p>
<p>Why are there no clear instructions for upgrading to SP2 in order to upgrade to SP3 on Microsoft's site?</p>
<p>The <i><b>lex parsimoniae</b></i> or Ockham's Razor type answer to these questions, while being highly accusatory, is that updating a once $400+ piece of proprietary software is a less favorable solution than another $200+ piece of software being purchased
 from the proprietors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have a better answer to these questions?<br />

            Tried the troubleshooting, it didn't change anything.&nbsp; I don't think it's a problem with the system though, I think it's part of the software design.&nbsp; When I try to start the computer in tablet mode, I get a message that says tablet mode has been disabled
 and is not available with multiple monitors attached.

            I believe it to be an intentional design. I run two monitors and also have found tablet mode is not available. If you remote in from a single display iPad you can get tablet mode from that interface but as soon as the iPad disconnects it leaves tablet
 mode.&nbsp;My setup is on my HTPC between a hdmi tv and a vga monitor. Next week I'll be replacing the vga monitor with a Asus 23" touchscreen and I don't&nbsp;expect tablet mode will to&nbsp;become available in that situation. It'd be cool if it does. Windows 10 does seem
 pretty smart though and I wouldn't be surprised if two touchscreens allows for tablet mode.

            Touch input works fine with multiple monitors, &nbsp;you just have to map the panel to the specific screen. &nbsp; That's not the problem, &nbsp;the tablet mode not being accessible on multiple monitors is.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>its indeed true windows 10 tablet mode doesn't support multi monitors</p>
<p>however&nbsp;there is a &nbsp;solution for this issue.</p>
<p>u can use ether amd eyefinity or nvidias surround </p>
<p>to make your screens act like they are 1 big screen</p>

            I wish Microsoft would implement this and allow it in Tablet mode.&nbsp; Either that or when you select Start Full Screen in Settings, have an option where the Start Screen would always be the default after you close out a program instead of always going back
 to the desktop.

<h2>            How do I get rid of unwanted &#34;system&#34; fonts in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    The font list for my graphics and word processing software is clogged with hundreds of fonts which I never use. Starting with a whole bunch whose names begin with @. I've been trying to prune the font list to ones which I'm likely to use, but with&nbsp;some
 of the unwanted ones, I get a message saying they're system fonts and they can't be deleted. I'm never likely to need Korean, Thai and similar fonts, so is there any way of beating the system and getting rid of them?

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I've just been using Windows Explorer to look at the contents of C:\Windows\Fonts, and using the delete option which is offered when I click on a font name. This works okay when getting rid of unwanted fonts installed with things like PhotoPlus and PagePlus,
 but not for these "system" fonts for foreign languages, which have been shoved in since Windows XP and which clog up the font list in graphics and word processing programs with uninspiring fonts which I never use.</p>
<p>Regards ...</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I've done that. But when I try to get rid of unwanted fonts like Batang, BatangChe, Dotum, DotumChe, etc., I get a message saying they cannot be deleted because they are protected system fonts. And the Show/Hide option doesn't have any effect on what appears
 in the font menu for my graphics &amp; word-processing software. There's a big, useless block of fonts with names starting with&nbsp;"@" whatever I do.</p>
<p>Regards ...</p>

            Batang and such are on my computer, but hidden and don't show in any of my software. &nbsp;Office of course respects this, but even software not made by Microsoft seems to only show the "unhidden" fonts. &nbsp;What software are you using that doesn't obey? &nbsp;Maybe
 we can find a workaround.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Wordperfect X3 and PhotoPlus X2 are my "always on" programs. I've been using Wordperf for about 20 years and I've built up a stable of fonts that I like. I've been able to use them uncluttered by "bloat" fonts because&nbsp;I've been able to zap the bloat&nbsp;up to
 Windows XP.</p>
<p>Just how vital are Batang and its pals? Is any useful part of Windows likely to fall over if I take drastic action against them?</p>
<p>Regards ...</p>

            There are ways to remove them from the registry (<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1076-fonts-delete.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">option 2 on this page explains how</a>), or by taking ownership of the font file itself, which will allow you to delete it (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/removing-foreign-language-fonts/60f5ac05-182e-438f-88e4-2a7432d8e161">this
 answer explains how</a>).
<div><br />
<div>In either case, my recommendation would be to backup the registry (File &gt; Export) before you make the change. If you're deleting the font file by changing the ownership, I'd recommend instead moving the font file to another folder (maybe 'font backup'
 in your Documents folder), so you can restore them if needed. &nbsp;Taking 10 seconds to make a System Restore point first would probably be prudent too.</div>

            <p>Good grief, Charlie Brown!!!!</p>
<p>I've just been looking at your second reference, Shawn, about taking ownership of font files and from the correspondence in it, it looks like Microsoft has built in a TON of trouble for anyone who doesn't appreciate having loads of bogus system files shoved
 at them.</p>
<p>I'm starting to lose the will to live and wondering if I can downgrade Windows 7 to XP, which doesn't have this totally unnecessary inconvenience.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch, Bill.</p>

            <p>p.s.</p>
<p>Any chance of a Hide option that does what it says on the box, i.e. hides the unwanted fonts which the user tags?</p>

            It does for programs that access the fonts using the correct APIs. &nbsp;If a program instead does it's own scan for all *.fon or *.ttf files, it will return all results. There's not really a way around that. &nbsp;Just a shame that the programs you use aren't compatible
 with the font API.
