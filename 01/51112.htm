<h2>            Windows 10 sound stops working but fine for a while after restartr</h2>
                    <p>I have been living with this issue for a while but now it's just a pain in the ****.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am running windows 10 with a Line6 UX2 as an audio interface and my audio out (i have a small home studio for recording guitars etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can happen very randomly, but the sound just stops working for most of the programs on the machine, this includes -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome</p>
<p>Firefox</p>
<p>Itunes</p>
<p>media monkey</p>
<p>windows media</p>
<p>VCL</p>
<p>i'm sure there are others that i haven't discovered just yet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When i am watching anything (chrome, firefox, IE), there will be a "click" type sound then Videos will not load (apart from the one that i am currently watching, that will keep playing till it gets to where it is currently loaded) iTunes will stop playing,
 VCL videos will stop playing with sound on the current video i'm watching and not load another video).&nbsp;</p>
<p>All windows sounds will also stop working...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ezdrummer 2 will keep producing sound, Reaper (multi track recording software) will keep producing sound, Podfarm 2 (guitar amp and effect modeling software) will keep producing sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing much else seems to be effected by the sound going out and it will all work again once i have done a re-boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried to update all of my drivers but still nothing, this has only really been happening for the last 12 or so months, and of that it's only been in the last few weeks that it has been happening on a regular basis ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can some one please help? this is doing my head in!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Windows 10 reset&#58; MS Office and Outlook gone after Windows reset</h2>
                    <p>PC would not boot.&nbsp; Windows Repair and System Restore would not work so did a Windows 10 Reset.&nbsp; Now all MS Office and Outlook apps are missing.&nbsp; An .html file was created on my desktop named "Removed Apps".&nbsp; Third party apps like "iTunes" are listed but
 Office and Outlook are NOT listed as removed apps.&nbsp; Searched C: drive for *.ost, *.pst and *.pab file names but found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are Office and Outlook gone?&nbsp; Is my email gone?&nbsp; It was stated that a System Reset would NOT remove this data.</p>

    <title>Sudden CPU hogging &#43; Cannot delete files on desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shattaad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sudden CPU hogging &#43; Cannot delete files on desktop</h2>
                    
<p>I was using FL Studio earlier to make some music then I exported a bunch of .wav files(as seperate channels) to my desktop. Now there's 14 '.wav' files on my desktop I no longer needed. When i try to highlight all of them to delete, a dialg box opens saying
 'preparing to delete' then below, it has est. time ...Calculating... and this box stays on forever without any change. I try to end the session, got a not responding alert and has to restart windows explorer. I try deleting one by one, same thing. I tried
 deleting/modifying any other files other than those 14 .wav files, they all&nbsp;deletes or works normally, no hassles. I even deleted a '.midi' file exported from the same FL Studio software without problems which begs the question. Why can't I delete/modify(move,
 copy, chk properties) those 14 .wav files. Seems like Windows Explorer crashes each time i try to delete them. Right-click on one of the files and click properties, nothing happens. I've tried several times&nbsp;after rebooting Windows, same thing. Another issue
 that arise almost at the same time was that I noticed my cpu(Athlon II&nbsp;x4 @2.8GHz) was constantly in use at ~60%(on all 4 cores). For comparison under normal operation, running a demanding application such as Call of Duty 4 game uses about as much(~60% i've
 checked) CPU resource. Before all this, when I check my cpu right after bootup, it uses 0-2% now after bootup, it uses 50-75% CONSTANTLY right away&nbsp;even during idle moments. When I check processes, an app call 'dllhost.exe a.k.a. COM Surrogate' has 25 listed
 under CPU constantly while ALL other processes opened are listed as 00 or 01 under the same parameter. I tried ending both process and process tree of the 'dllhost.exe' but it starts right back up with the same 25 listed under CPU and my CPU resource still
 used up at ~60%. This is all very puzzling as they all seems to happen at about the same time and without any precursor actions/errors. Someone please help me solve these issues or at least let me know what could possibly cause these symptoms.</p>
<p>My Specs: CPU- Athlon II 630&nbsp;x4 @2.8GHz, RAM- 8GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333MHz, Nvidia 9600GT GPU, Momentus XT Hybrid HDD(7200rpm/4Gb SSM) 250GB total(112 GB free), 64-bit OS Windows 7(latest updates installed), DirectX11</p>

            <p>Yes, my system issues have been resolved. Sorry for taking so long to get back to you guys. After working with the engineer for a couple days we finally found a way to remove the files and stop the hogging but this is a partial fix in that the root cause
 remains until Microsoft post a fix for this issue, I was not charged by the department since this is a Microsoft system fault&nbsp;in addition to the&nbsp;cooperative solution approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution is to delete the problematic files and install the latest updates for Windows and whatever software that output the file(in my case FL Studio).You'll need the Microsoft Windows Performance toolkit, scanned your system for the source cpu
 and PWS mem usage to identify the files in use by dllhost, then kill all services except for critical ones. Make sure you do not access those issue files. The only way to delete those problem files is from DOS. You will first need to change the access right
 for your&nbsp;ACLs using the CACLS command. Once you've changed it for each of the file paths that you wanted to delete, you may delete each files *individually*. After the deletion, you'll need to restart your computer. then your pc should run normal with normal
 cpu usage hereafter.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Account Keeps randomly signing me out and not accepting my password&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I know there is a trouble shooting section for this issue on the xbox website, HOWEVER, I have followed these steps multiple times and every time they do nothing for my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past 2-3 months my xbox will have me signed out when I turn it on and it requests my password. Every time I enter it, it says that I need to enter my Microsoft password which I am. I following the advice of factory resetting and removing my account
 has not been proven to work for myself and if you look at comment sections on other things such as videos, these methods don't work for the majority of others either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has worked for me is resetting my password every time it happens but that is not convenient!!</p>
<p>This has happened to me at least 5-6 times at this point and it is extremely annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox support, you guys need to find a fix for this issue.</p>

<p>I would be concerned about Account Security.&nbsp; I would log into your Microsoft Account page and change your password, right out.&nbsp; Then I would recommend you review the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12410/microsoft-account-how-to-help-keep-your-account-safe-and-secure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
steps you can take to further secure that account with things like two-factor authentication.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, check your Privacy and Online Safety settings and ensure that they are set how you want them to be set; considering what you like to do online and what you're comfortable with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go through those steps to secure your account and see if the issue persists.&nbsp; It wouldn't hurt to also visit your Microsoft Account page Payments &amp; Billing &gt; Order History to make sure that if the account was compromised, that there were no fraudulent charges
 made.</p>

<h2>            Desktop Icons</h2>
                    <p>I want to change the icons in a shortcut. For example, I want to add the Comcast logo as a shortcut icon or just have more than 4 choices that are given.</p>
<p>I set up the URL and then click on Change Icon, but there is only 4 icons to choose from. &nbsp;Where can I download more icons from a secure site. &nbsp;I also found some stuff about icons in Build 10056. How do I get to those without rebuilding a computer? &nbsp;I use
 to have a lot until I needed a new hard drive and had Windows 10 installed instead of an upgrade from Windows 8 to 10 that use to be on my compute.r</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get XBox 360 connected to new router</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Our old router/firewall died, I have replaced it today, we have all our wired devices working OK, all our wireless pc's work OK, our TV &amp; the Wii all connect OK to the internet!</p>
<p>The pc's all file share OK, the printers all work.</p>
<p>The Xbox on the other hand won't connect!</p>
<p>I have tried everything I know I went through the connection wizard help system, but I had already done all these suggestions!</p>
<p>The connection fails between the xbox &amp; the wireless router.</p>
<p>I get the following codes on the status screen</p>
<p>W: 0000 - 0000</p>
<p>X: 8000 - 0011</p>
<p>Y: 0000 - 0000</p>
<p>Z: 0000 - 0000</p>
<p>ID: 0000 - 0006</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XBox is standard config less than a year old.</p>
<p>Router is a DrayTek Vigor 2380Vn, internet is a Virgin Media cable connection.</p>
<p>We are in the UK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help please before my lad gives me a row for breaking his XBox! &nbsp; ;-0</p>

<p>Thanks mate. That wording is essential, in fact (it will point us in the correct direction for troubleshooting). This new router isn't the same model that you had previously, is it? And as for the UPnP, your new router handbook should have information on
 whether or not that's supported.</p>

<p>Spent a few hours yesterday working through all the settings one by one.</p>
<p>Started with a totally unsecured open network, then slowly built up the security to the required level.</p>
<p>The router can handle simultaneous connections from both WPA &amp; WPA2 clients with the same security settings.</p>
<p>It looks like the XBox can't connect in this configuration so I had to downgrade the security to WPA for all clients on that SSID subnet.</p>
<p>Funnily enough all of the other devices whether they were WPA or WPA2 capable all were happy.</p>
<p>Sorted now thanks for the suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure you are using the latest version of firmware on the router, stuff like this is/can usually be fixed in firmware, the Xbox is certainly capable of WPA2</p>

<p>Definitely the latest firmware on the router, also it only arrived on the14th July new!</p>
<p>All the other wireless devices on the ssid I want to connect the XBox to connect fine in WPA2 with WPA simultaneously enabled.</p>
<p>The XBox will not connect in simultaneous WPA &amp; WPA2 mode, nor will it connect in WPA2 only mode, maybe the XBox firmware is the issue?</p>
<p>The Wii connected fine as did all the laptops, IPhones, Andorid phone, etc. etc. in WPA2 mode with mixed WPA &amp; WPA2 enabled.</p>
<p>I now have it all the devices connected in WPA mode thanks, I may try again at another time to get the WPA2 working but there is no desperate rush.</p>

<h2>            File History of files on external USB harddisk drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a external harddisk connected to my pc using USB. This drive contains personal files which I want to add to file history. I simply want that everytime I connect my external harddrive to my pc, that file history backs up the files on it to a location
 on the network. How do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I have file history working for files on an internal harddrive</p>
<p>* I did add my external harddrive to the Documents library</p>
<p>* I tried adding the folder on the external harddrive using the "Add a folder" using the windows 10 settings. But the folder seems to dissappear from the list after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another detail: the disk is encrypted using DiskCryptor. Everytime I connect the drive windows says it has to be formatted. When I mount the drive by providing the key to DiskCryptor the drive becomes a valid one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start using File History to back up your files, you need to first select where your backups are saved. You can select an externally connected drive, such as a USB drive, or you can save to a drive on a network. There are other choices, but these
 two provide the best options to help protect your files against a crash or other PC problems.</p>

 Reconfigure each device, Mouse, Keyboard, Printer &amp; Phone. Then, the system runs perfectly well for an hour to two. Suddenly, the Bluetooth icon disappears as does the function of each Bluetooth device. I thought perhaps the mouse was a problem, as it is a
 version 1 device. I obtained a new Microsoft Bluetooth mouse. Only the find the same problem. I updated the driver from Dell for the 355 module. Same problem. I finally dug out an old USB Linksy Bluetooth controller and d

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are no Windows 7 drivers for the XPS M1530 from Dell which may be the over-all<br />
problem.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with the<br />
Compatibility Center (for the major devices)?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor &lt;- run this with the Dell module active<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check Control Panel - Device Manager - double click on the BlueTooth Device (the Dell module)<br />
and on the Power Management tab - check the settings there.<br />
<br />
Have you checked with Dell Support, their on-line documentation, and their forums for known<br />

<h2>            Sons Fortnite won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>Hello my son hasn't been able to play his Xbox one Fortnite game for 3 weeks. He updated it but it still wouldn't load. So he deleted it and reinstalled it but it still won't load. When he tries the loading bar doesn't come up and just sends him back to the home screen. Any ideas please? Thank you</p>

    <title>Skype for Business on iPhone 6S with iOS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fletchef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business on iPhone 6S with iOS 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype for Business for meetings and chats just fine until I recently attempted to log in and received "We can't sign you in. Please try again". So far I have attempted reentering the password several times, changing my password, entering
 an intentionally wrong password (still the same message), updating the app, removing and reinstalling the app and hard restarts of the phone. I always receive the same message when I try to log in. I have been at this for roughly a week and my on site IT staff
 does not seem to know what is going on, and just suggests waiting and trying again later. Is there anything else I should be trying? I travel next week and would love to resolve it by then!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help!</p>

            Hi Fletchef,<br />
<br />
For your situation, please make sure the account you are trying to sign into Skype for Business in your iPhone 6s has the Skype for Business online license firstly. To check it (as an admin), you can sign into
<a href="https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 admin portal</a>&gt; Users (Active Users)&gt; choose the account you are signing into Skype for Business in your iPhone 6S&gt; click it (edit)&gt; product licenses&gt; Skype for Business online Plan 2 (an example) status should be on.
<br />
<br />
Secondly, ensuring you have typed the right user name and password, change another network environment. For example, change from 3G/4G to Wi-Fi and reverse back.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, Id like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The result of Skype for Business (formerly known as Lync) Domain Name Server (DNS) Connectivity Test via
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a>. Click Office 365&gt; Office 365 General Tests (Office 365 Lync Domain Name Server (DNS) Connectivity Test)&gt; Next&gt; Sign-in address&gt; perform test. After you get the result, please put it in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
private message</a> for analysis.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether the issue persists in another mobile device. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<h2>            Freecell -- Introducting Solvable Decks</h2>
                    <p>Today, for the first time, when I attempt to play Freecell, a message appears "Introducing Solvable Decks".</p>
<p>Is this a new "sales" tactic by Microsoft?</p>
<p>I have concerns about security / hacking; so, I do not like selecting an item until I understand something about it and if it will involve pressure to purchase a game which is already available on this version (10) of windows.</p>

            <p>I don't like the fact that a full advertising video is played before opening any game in the Solitaire collection. Worse still, Microsoft say you have to purchase Premium collections to disable ads and the purchase is only valid for 12mths. A total rip off
 and worse, its an invasion of my privacy and security. I should be the one to choose whether I want ads on my pc, not MS or any one else trying to force me to buy stuff.</p>
<p>I doubt this is legal in the way they do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems privacy and security of our data and pc's means nothing to Microsoft, time to move back to Linux.</p>
<p>

            <p>As I see it, you have three choices:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Don't click on the message, and thus remain unable to play the game;</li><li>Click on the message and find out that it's just a notification and will have no effect on anything;</li><li>&nbsp;Click on the message and learn that your fears are accurate. </li></ol>
<p>I just tried opening Free Cell myself and didn't see the message you're seeing, so I couldn't click through it to see what would happen.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else has clicked through it and can report on the results, but if it were me, I would choose number
 2.&nbsp; It's unlikely that MS is trying to force you to buy anything. </p>

            <p>The message is clear at the bottom of the ad. It states:- To disable ads upgrade to premium -unquote. If that isn't a form of ransom-ware I don't know what is. You can't skip the video and it goes on for several minutes. Its typical Microsoft, just impose
 something regardless of anyone's privacy or security.</p>
<p>I stopped being an insider for same reason, seems we're just ignored and microsoft go ahead and do things regardless.</p>

 a copy of the zip file to an external device such as a DVD. </p>

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>I'm considering 2 options at present. 1, go back to windows 7, (original os before upgrading to 10) or Ubuntu which I've used in the past and is at least configurable to what I want rather than what the likes of Microsoft want us to have.</p>
<p>I'm rapidly losing faith and trust in Microsoft. I value my privacy and security even if they don't.</p>

<p>The message is clear at the bottom of the ad. It states:- To disable ads upgrade to premium -unquote. If that isn't a form of ransom-ware I don't know what is. You can't skip the video and it goes on for several minutes. Its typical Microsoft, just impose
 something regardless of anyone's privacy or security.</p>
<p>I stopped being an insider for same reason, seems we're just ignored and microsoft go ahead and do things regardless.</p>

<p>You&nbsp; don't seem to know what ransomware is, but let it pass.&nbsp; It's not at all unusual these days to be offered a "premium" version of an app in order to avoid ads.&nbsp; It happens in Android, it happens in iOS, and now it's happening in Windows.&nbsp; There is no
 threat to your security or privacy, and generally the ads run for thirty seconds, not "several minutes."&nbsp; If you don't like the ads and don't want to pay, don't play the games.&nbsp;

    <title>Switch language in onscreen keyboard without external keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switch language in onscreen keyboard without external keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I need some help on an additional language and keyboard.</p>
<p>I'm using an HP touch screen laptop that has a detachable keyboard (English only).</p>
<p>I just upgraded to Win 10 and have most everything I need set-up. Still a learning process from Win 7 (phew).</p>
<p>I have installed a 2nd language, Lao, and don't have a problem with that per-se. What I'm having a problem with is getting a "virtual" keyboard to appear on the desktop to use in place of the attached English keyboard.</p>
<p>I can switch languages by pressing the icon on the task bar. However, when I change the language and want to type anything, there is no keyboard with the Lao characters that comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get the "virtual" Lao keyboard to show-up when I want to type something in Lao?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

I recently moved to windows 10 from windows 7. Since I restarted my PC, it stuck to&nbsp;<strong>Operating System Not Found</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t switch graphics for games downloaded from Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>Its not everyday when i buy/download games from Windows Store.</p>
<p>I usually prefer buying them online.</p>
<p>After massive 32Gb installation of Halo 5 i felt pity on myself when i realised i cant ruk the game on my AMD r5 330 graphic chipset</p>
<p>It automatically detects Intel HD 5500 graphic card which is by default integrated.</p>
<p>I tried forcing the app to use AMD card by enabling the game to high performance via AMD control centre, but then i realised as it's a Windows store app</p>
<p>Neither me nor any other user/administrator can't modify/write on the application.</p>
<p>So it's impossible (for me) to change the graphic card for the game</p>
<p>And it lags as hell when player via&nbsp; Intels HD GRAOHICS card</p>
<p>Please help and lemme know how to fix this</p>

<p>I believe your R5 330 dedicated graphics card does not meet the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">minimum</span></em> system requirements, which is an<em>&nbsp;
<p>and while the HD5500 integrated graphics also falls below minimum your machine is likely switching to that when</p>
<p>theR5 330 is not accepted by a game.</p>
<p>- The game will also reject your R5 330 if it has less than 2GB VRAM ( The specs for R5 330 say
<p>laptop models may have less).</p>
<p>- It's possible the game is running on the HD5500 because your machine has 2GB system RAM dedicated to the integrated</p>
<p>graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Not that the R5 330 is not significantly more powerful than the HD5500 anyway. The only real advantage it would have</p>
<p>over the HD5500 is that it has VRAM, which is faster than system RAM used by the HD5500.</p>
<p>However, if your laptops R5 has less than 2GB VRAM that small advantage would be diminished.</p>
<p>Passmark scores:</p>
<p>R5 330 = 661</p>
<p>HD 5500 = 579</p>
<p>
</p><p>R7 260 = 3141 - Almost 5x more processing power than the R5 330</p>

<p>after a little while I found it locked(that's usual)....... Entered password then saw that my normal desktop screen with icons was literally washed away by a complete black screen and there's nothing I could do in this matter as there is no start and taskbar.</p>
<p>also after unlocking it again gets locked after a few seconds.</p>
<p>even after trying again And again the result is same as I explained.</p>

</p><p>The standard keyboard toggle for that is&nbsp; LeftAlt+LeftShift+PrintScrn</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW why did you do that?&nbsp; Was there something running that was hard to read?&nbsp; Because another option is to use the Magnifier.&nbsp; E.g. press Win-+&nbsp; and choose the Fullscreen mode (Ctrl+Alt+F).&nbsp; You can also use Magnifier's Reverse video option in case there
 is&nbsp;a problem with contrast in what you are viewing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you can't get into Task Manager&nbsp;your only option short of booting your recoverable media is to use the Restart item in the Shut down menu of your Login screen (bottom right).&nbsp; You must press Shift when you click on the Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there would be one more possibility related to the scenario I outlined.&nbsp; It's possible that your explorer.exe is not working (so that would explain why the Win-P and Win-Enter commands would not work) and that the Ctrl-Alt-Delete prompt is showing
 on the "other screen".&nbsp; Then, in the same way that I was having you pretend that you could see the Project dialog and use it, you could pretend that you could see the Ctrl-Alt-Delete dialog and use it.&nbsp; In that case you would need to press End and Enter to
 select and start it.&nbsp; But that would still not be enough because the Task Manager window would probably still be only seen on the "other screen".&nbsp; Then you would have to initiate a Move of the window using your keyboard.&nbsp; That would be&nbsp; Alt-Space M and an
 Arrow key.&nbsp; After that you may notice that your mouse pointer had changed its icon and you could drag the Task Manager window into view.&nbsp; If the mouse cannot engage with the window's Title bar there is still the possibility of you being able to "drag" the
 window using repeated presses of an arrow key but only if you are sure that you are moving it in the right direction.&nbsp; E.g. in the "wrong direction" you would end up bumping into the other side of the hidden screen, with no possibility of a wrap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW in the Login Screen you would also have the option of starting Narrator under the Accessibility menu (bottom left).&nbsp; I suggest you do that in case it helps give you any clues about what is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 doesn&#39;t show all user icons on start</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have windows 7 home installed with Administrator and 3 other accounts. Whenever I start the computer, it shows me the Administrator icon and the password field. Other icons are NOT shown.<br />
<br />
I have tried "Switch User", but then it doesn't accept the log in name and password.<br />
<br />
Only option I have is to log on to Administrator, then log out. This way I can see the other user account icon. Not to mention that the passwords now work.<br />
<br />
Tried many solutions, the ctrl+alt+del to log on option is unchecked, help!

<p>Hi PEISG,</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your computer is connected to the domain network then this may not help.</p>
<p>To see all the user accounts on the Login screen of the home group or workgroup network follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;First lets login with the current user account.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start and type run in the search and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Lets type <strong>control userpaswords2</strong> in the run window and hit Enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Lets check whether the check box which says <strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use is checked</strong>. If the check box is checked then lets uncheck the check box, click on
<strong>apply </strong>and ok tab and hit<strong> enter.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will now be able to see different users in the logon screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this does not help, you will then have to contact the respective IT department of the domain network to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Method 2: You may also try this method:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start-&gt; Run-&gt;&nbsp;type secpol.msc and press enter.<br />
2.Navigate to Local policies -&gt; Security options.<br />
3.Find the entry "Interactive Logon: Do not display last user name" and make sure it is disabled.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 to 4K Monitor Connectivity Via Dock</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 4 connected via a Dock to a Samsung U28E590D 4 K monitor. &nbsp;However, although I can get a picture there are black bands down each side of the monitor at the highest resolution. &nbsp;At a lower resolution (1080) the whole screen is filled
 but this seems to defeat the object of having a 4K display. &nbsp;I have tried a miniDP to HDMI cable and a miniDP to HDMI adaptor but neither gives me the full 4K display. &nbsp;Please can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 constant graphics crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>having major issues with my&nbsp;PC its a HP workstation running Windows 10 keeps crashing with graphics card crashed and recovered (Nvidia NVS310) although this was all working fine till a week ago and I think it is something to do with the Cumulative update
 for W10 version 1511 (KB3135782) sent out since then its been a nightmare.&nbsp; It also freezes and then I have to hard power off the PC!!!!!&nbsp; I was hoping the cumulative update that came out yesterday (KB3140768) was maybe the fix but still the same!!!</p>

<p><span>Boot the PC in <strong>
Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below. </span><span>Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the device driver or the corrupted system files on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot the PC in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the PC to exit from
<strong>Safe mode</strong> and start the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)
</strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Run
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior. System freezes are mostly caused due to the unwanted/unused files retained in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>View all </strong>from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> from the listed options, click on <strong>Advanced
</strong>option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the troubleshooting is completed, check the status for any missing system components on the computer.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;is resolved&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the
</span><span>status of the issue for further assistance.
</span><span>Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span>This is the second time Ive seen this issue today. You will have to switch to a Local Account, then switch back to a Microsoft
 Account using the correct email address. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, press the Windows Logo key+I and then click Change PC settings (at the bottom) &gt; Users (in the left pane) &gt; Switch
 to a local account and follow the wizard, which will allow you to log in to Windows as you did with previous versions of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now switch back to a Microsoft Account using the correct mail address by going to Change PC settings &gt; Users&gt; Switch to a Microsoft
 account. Follow the prompts to set up your Microsoft account with the correct email address.</span></p>
