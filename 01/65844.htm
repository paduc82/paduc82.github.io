<h2>            Lag&#47;Rubberbanding&#47;Random Disconnects</h2>
                    
<p>I got my Limited Edition on midnight release night and got home with it and my gf and I both experienced major rubberbanding issues immediately in mulitiplayer. I have a steady 10 Mbps connection and both of our xbox 360 slims are wired. I initially wrote
 the issue off to it being brand new and everyone being online. I started checking with all of my friends and apparently some of them had no problems or issues at all. I have tried only playing on one xbox 360 thinking that for some reason (with only this game)
 the issue was caused because my gf and I were playing gears at the same time and it was putting a strain on my connection?? Yeah that didn't make any difference at all. I don't see a whole lot of lag except for when the rubberbanding happens. I will be running/walking
 in any direction and all of a sudden my character jumps 4 or 5 steps back. It makes it impossible to shoot anyone or do anything really for that matter. I can't even use steps lol. So that was the first night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was experiencing the same rubberbanding issues only now my gf and I are getting disconnected at the end of every single match. We somehow make it through the match without rage quitting and throwing our boxes outside and then at the end where
 the loading screen comes up, it freezes. The little tip things still change but it just leaves us there in the loading screen. We even tried waiting for over 10 minutes to make sure it wasn't just taking a while on several different occasions and it still
 stayed frozen. We end up having to dashboard out and then we come back and get the penalty to quitting even though we finished the entire match.</p>
<p>It's getting very frustrating to say the least. I've tried to join the forums on Epics site but after registering and going through the activation, I for some reason am still not able to post anything to the gears of war 3 technical issues board. So, I'm
 posting here in hopes that someone has some kind of news on this other than telling me my connection is broken, my xbox is broken, etc. Any suggestions?? Please tell me I'm not alone on this...</p>

<p>Oh and I would like to add that even though my experience has not been very fun so far, I'm loving the game. I don't want anyone thinking that I'm just trolling or anything. The graphics and the new story line are great. I'm probably going to just work on
 the campaign until epic gets this sorted out. </p>

<p>Nat is not restricted? &nbsp;I haven't had any significant lag problems (By that I mean while playing 4 player co-op online get a few little jumps in cut scenes) &nbsp;But I have been in the thick of it tons of crap going on and no lag. &nbsp;8-/ &nbsp;sorry buddy. &nbsp;I have
 a 25mb/sec connection using wireless probably get 10 on my box but doesn't seem like it while downloading tho I never lag on games.

<p>I knew I left something out lol. Yes, my NAT is open. I've never had issues with either of the two slim &nbsp;360s we are using. They have been checked and the setting have been checked. Just doesn't make any sense. I can't find much online about the rubberbanding
 issue either. Only the random disconnects. It doesn't seem like regular lag, I play fine for the 3 or 4 seconds up until it pulls me back in time :p</p>

<p>I think Epic behind the scenes it limiting their dedicated servers to some of the community and not all the community at the same time. &nbsp;Maybe it would be cost prohibitive for over 100,000 plus players I don't know. &nbsp;Since there is NO way to check and verify
 if your on a dedicated server or not they can get away with this if they wanted to. &nbsp;I am sure it is about $ dollars saved. &nbsp; It seems to be hit or miss cause I &nbsp;can tell when game is balanced with no lag and when game is not balanced and shots don't register.
 &nbsp;I could be entirely wrong, but it makes me question. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've read some other posts that were similar in nature MizZoorA, but I'm not sure how much stock I can give that idea. I am leaning more towards it probably has something to do with the game just hitting this week. There seems to be several, totally different
 issues that people are having. In my case, my bullets are making contact. There just seems to be a bit of lag in movement and therefore when I shoot, it's at the wrong time. In other words, I roll towards and enemy and fire when it appears that I'm in front
 of them, however the rubberbanding happens and it turns out I was nowhere near the enemy when I fired.</p>

<p>It's possible that I mistakenly called it rubberbanding when it's not. However, I thought rubberbanding was when you appeared to be going in one direction, then you are pulled to some other place on the map. Please advise if I'm wrong. The lag honestly seems
 minimal. It IS difficult to tell the difference at times when I'm in a match no doubt.

<p>yeah, rubberbanding is a "feature" they use in games like the older lego games, where if you're playing co-op, and the two players get far away from each other, it'll "warp" the other player closer, or won't let the lead player go ahead any farther. basically
 keeping the two players near each other (as if they were tied together with a rubberband)... annoying.</p>
<p>i thought you meant that gears now had rubberbanding built in to the co-op to keep players in the same area... that would've been a big BOOOO! ;)</p>

<div>Surely you originally had a screen with a list of the three users, and each was able to choose their name (or any other) on that screen and hit enter and see their own desktop?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So--there has to be that single screen, minimally.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another responder here just posted this page:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In response to a different problem, but the information on this page may help you out as well:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You do not want to set up an autologon--that would result in the desktop of one of the three users being displayed at startup--and you want the choice screen.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, check the method shown in Method 1 at the above link--and use that to remove the password from each of the three users.&nbsp; I think that will get you back to where you started.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any implementation of Parental Controls depends on the Parent being able to supply a token--password, username, etc--which is unknown to the Children.&nbsp; This isn't impossible in a setup such as you describe, but it means that the controls
 must be dependent on some other set of credentials than the user logon to the computer.&nbsp; I'm sure you're aware of this though, since you're choosing to leave the system open intentionally.&nbsp; I've found some forms of "control" to be helpful--for example, I have
 my router set to turn off the Internet connection to my 13 year-old daughter's machine at midnight--and that does help her get off the thing and get to bed.&nbsp; Broader Internet content-related controls turned out to be more annoying than helpful--for both of
 us--and in the end the result has been that I removed the control and feel as though we're communicating better about what is safe and what is not.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Once you are sure there is no malware see the last section below to remove any remaining<br />
error messages.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point.<br />

it works (very well).<br />

Second the issue could be caused by malware and we don't know of what variety at this point.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you are unable to print several images from windows explorer in windows
 7 computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Help me with little information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this issue specific to these images? Are you able to print other files successfully?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the printer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try printer images individually and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Start and Search not working and no apps accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caroljh06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start and Search not working and no apps accessible</h2>
                    Windows 10 was upgraded overnight several days ago.&nbsp; Since then I've lost use of the Start button and Search.&nbsp; I have no access to any start menu&nbsp;buttons thus the only way to use Word is to open an existing file and click on the "new" icon.&nbsp; I can't access
 Microsoft store so can't download any apps.&nbsp; After the update, there was a message that said nothing would be different, yet everything is different with very little access to necessary items.&nbsp; I have removed a security software and created a local account
 as suggested in other places.&nbsp; Please help.

<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to sign out of the current user account, restart the system and login to the Microsoft user account to check if the issue persists. Further, try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the affected user account is Microsoft user Account then you can also run the Microsoft Account troubleshooter to check if that helps.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/microsoftaccounts.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span>Microsoft Account Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></a><span>
<strong>(Applies to Windows 10)</strong></span></p>

</p><p><span>Further try the below PowerShell command to check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>PowerShell Command to reset Applications. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Open an Elevated PowerShell prompt by pressing the Windows Key, typing

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When I sign out and reboot the only signin option is for my local account.&nbsp; If I go to Control Panel and choose "user accts", select "make changes to your user acct in PC settings" then "sign in with a Microsoft acct instead" it says "search for app in the
 store?"&nbsp; If I reply "yes" nothing happens.&nbsp; I need help changing to my Microsoft acct.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to follow your second suggestion by opening and elevated PowerShell prompt by pressing the Windows Key, but my Windows Key doesn't work.&nbsp; I went into Command Prompt and pasted your command there (not sure that makes sense) and it gave me this
 reply:&nbsp; "Get-AppXPackage is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help me?&nbsp; thank you.&nbsp; </p>

            You can try uninstalling/reinstalling the app, but if that doesn't work your best source of information is the app developer--use the support link on the app's page in the Store.

            Hi Rmar,
Did you task manager and processes if Mcafee is running?
Did you try to check the registry if it's there? 
If you cant see the app in add/remove program in control panel to remove it, you can use some tools like from Bitdefender, eset to remove ANY antivirus app

<h2>            Printer priting only a blank page after installing Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original title: February 2013 update causing printing problems for Windows 7.</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently updated windows 7.&nbsp; This included SP3 and quite a few other updates including one for the HP LaserJet 1022.&nbsp; That printer now produces only blank pages.&nbsp; The printer test button produces a lovely page. I have checked all of the connections, I
 have deinstalled and reinstalled the driver, I have turned the printer and computer off/on at the appropriate times.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Blinking green light -- disc tray won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t eject - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blinking green light -- disc tray won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t eject</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys.<br />
A couple nights ago, I repaired my out-of-warranty xbox (original phat white model from 2007) that got the E74 RROD by using the penny trick to re-warp the HANA/ANA chip and balance out the RAM blocks. So that's all fine and dandy now. It boots up into the
 dashboard just fine.</p>
<p>Here's my problem:<br />
Now, every time I boot it up I'm greeted with a rapid blinking green light (not offline downloading or cloud storage updating or anything of that matter-- it's 2-3 times per second.) I'm convinced that this is signifying a greater problem with the disk drive,
 however due to Microsoft's poor engineering and integration, I'm not sure how to test anything on the drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I switched out the SATA cable from my step-dad's computer to the xbox to see if it was the cable; the problem continued.<br />
How can I test the power cable? It doesn't seem to be standard to me.<br />
<br />
I tried to connect power the drive from my Xbox and hook the SATA connection from the Benq disc drive up to my step-dad's computer, which didn't recognize it. I'm not sure if this is a driver problem or something else, as it's been years since I've used a Windows
 PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, each drive has a unique key on it so it pairs with the mobo and no other drive can run games on that Xbox. What can I do? If I can get the xbox up and running, I don't want it to be banned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm really at a loss as to what to do, so any helpful input would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ur modding of the xbox no doubt caused a problem. And you wont be able to find help on the xbox website due to violating section F of the Terms of use. Any repairs have to be done by sending it in to get fixed.</p>

<p>A blinking green light usually means the console is trying to tell the disk drive to eject. Are you sure it isn't a problem with the console and not just the disk drive itself?</p>
<p>Are you booting the console by pressing the eject button at all? I feel your pain on the E74 error... A friend of mine recently experienced that on his 1st gen 360 and it was out of warranty.</p>

<p>Lancearrow1, that's the conclusion I've come to. The problem, is, though that the xbox obviously isn't under the 3-year warranty due to it being a 6-year old Xbox, and it'll cost about $100 for M$ to repair it. I'm strapped for cash and would rather shell
 out $30 or so for a new drive if that's what the solution calls for. Not to mention I'm more comfortable handling my own hardware since I know Microsoft ships out their repairs to a third-party company anyway.</p>
<p>SpectralWrath, I'm not positive as I don't really have a spare console to test the drive with, nor do I have a ck3 chip to load it onto a computer properly to check.</p>
<p>Actually no, I haven't been. Should I try?</p>
<p>Before the blinking green light (as I was getting the xbox to load the dashboard and stop displaying the E74 error), I could hear mechanical spinning though the eject button didn't work. Now I just don't hear anything.</p>

            <p><span>1. If it’s just finger-trouble that has changed the attribute, open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type CMD and press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>Type X: and press Enter (change X to the drive letter of your external disk).</span></p>
<p><span>Type ATTRIB -H /S /D and press Enter (this may take some time).</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. If it’s caused by malware, drive C&nbsp;may also be affected as&nbsp;it is possible that bogus antimalware has hidden the files.

<p>
<span>Check if you have a folder named smtmp in C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Temp. If you have, read
</span><span>about and then perhaps&nbsp;run </span><span>Unhide, scroll down here

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do not delete anything in your Temp folder as this is the likely place that your files have been copied to. If for some reason you cannot
 run Unhide, scroll down the page a little and make a note of the folders that need to be manually copied back to their rightful locations.</span></p>

<h2>            Laptop Brightness Keeps Fading in and Out -- &#42;&#42;Adaptive Brightness is OFF&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    <p>About two months ago I bought a new Toshiba laptop with Windows 10. &nbsp;It's been great so far with very few performance issues. &nbsp;However, a few nights ago it decided to update without my asking. &nbsp;I know that's a Windows 10 thing so I thought nothing of it.
 &nbsp;The next day I turned on my laptop and started noticing the screen was acting funny. &nbsp;It consistently fades from 100% full where I like it to about 50% brightness as if on battery. &nbsp;This not only makes it frustrating to look at, but when it is that low in
 brightness it is hard for me to see and read. &nbsp;Even typing this question is a bit difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now before anyone starts saying "Fix your adaptive brightness" I immediately googled the problem and thought that must be it and went to change it, but found it was already disabled. &nbsp;I even enabled and disabled it just in case to no affect. &nbsp;I've changed
 brightness levels, turned on and off eco mode, restarted my laptop, and messed with everything in the power system, but cannot get it to stop. &nbsp;It even does this in a completely dark room at night where there is no light or light changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What frustrates me further is this never happened before&nbsp;<em>until this update</em>. &nbsp;I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't at my wit's end and have no other ideas how to fix it. &nbsp;Can someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Adaptive Brightness is off</p>
<p>- Eco mode is off</p>
<p>- Brightness is on full</p>
<p>- This happens on all modes, even battery</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>The model of my laptop is HP SPECTRE x360 convertible. Its a 2017 model.</p>
<p>There is no error message at all. While starting up the computer its just showing that its searching for the face but the light does not turn on of the camera. So it does not detect my face and does not unlock.</p>
<p>And when I try to reset the face recognition with Windows Hello, the camera does not start at all and the setup is not done. But the camera is working otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to refresh and restart the computer but it was not of any help.</p>
<p>The operating system is windows 10 home. Version - 1709. OS BUILD - 16299.64</p>
<p>Please help me solve this issue.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Nancy</strong>,</p>

and <strong>version </strong>of <strong>Windows 10</strong> that’s installed on your device. To get this information, type
<strong>winver </strong>in the <strong>search </strong>from the <strong>Start Menu</strong>. Then, may ask if you’ve encountered an

<h2>            Volume Icon in system tray won&#39;t open after installing latest Windows10 updates</h2>
                    <p>since I installed the latest updates to windows 10, the volume icon&nbsp;in system tray no longer works.
</p>
<p>The icon <strong>IS</strong> there in the system tray</p>
<p>hovering over the icon shows the volume level</p>
<p>HOWEVER, when I left click OR right click on the icon, <strong>NOTHING</strong> happens---it will not open so that I can adjust the volume level</p>
<p>Why do the Windows10 updates do more harm than good?</p>
<p>I routinely&nbsp;keep sound levels low until I want to listen to something---now 1 PC (Win10 home) is stuck on volume 20% and laptop ( Win10 Pro) stuck on volume 63%</p>
<p><strong>How can I fix this</strong>? </p>
<p>THANKS</p>

 Home to Win10 Home with successful activation but now with the new tower Win10 isn't &amp; can't activate &amp; gives an error code: 0x800704CF. I haven't made any changes with the product key or software. Why won't it allow to activate even though I have the original
 hard drive where Windows was installed?&nbsp;

            <p>Because you changed the motherboard, this invalidates the original Windows 7 Home OEM license you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means, you will need to purchase an entirely new Windows 10 Home license.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 strange UI behavor</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>my question is about windows 10 desktop shell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- when I press the windows key (or click on windows icon), the start menu pops up,&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I press the windows key (or click on windows icon) for the second time, the start menu disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- when I press windows+A (or click the notifications icon), action center pops up.</p>
<p>when I press windows+A (or click the notifications icon) for the second time, action center disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- when I press windows+S (or click on cortana icon, or 3 finger touch on touchpad), cortana appears.</p>
<p>but when I press windows+S (or click on cortana icon, or 3 finger touch on touchpad) for the second time,&nbsp;</p>
<p>cortana menu (or the search menu) does not disappear, and reappears with the animation again.</p>
<p>it does not disappear.</p>

            Dunno, maybe something to do with Cortana having a text box to type into ?&nbsp; Same thing happens with &lt;Win+R&gt; which brings up the Run box (also a text entry field).<br />

            <p>run box is more interesting situation.</p>
<p>it is a window, which can be dragged. ))) and it stays until you close or run a command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think microsoft is sloppy and not caring much about the overall user interaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it too hard to design an UI ergonomically with an overall same experience in mind and consistent behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think microsoft ordered these two implementations to two different teams and they implemented as they wanted. )))</p>
<p>
</p><p>run box comes from the stone age, and that code seems to be untouched )))</p>
<p>because its a holy code. )))</p>
