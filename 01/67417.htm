 be replaced by a password? When resetting credentials, would you have to replace it with a password first and then change it to a Passport credential? How would you reset this on a domain with Active Directory? You can't obviously reset a "password" to someone's

<p>Zen for the Xbox can only be purchased on the Xbox. However, you can earn Zen by getting Astral Diamonds in game and converting them to Zen using the Astral Diamond Exchange. You can get AD from salvaging epic equipment, selling items on the Trade House,
 doing daily quests and running skirmishes or dungeons while the "Skirmishes" or "Dungeon Delves" events are running. Also, on occasion a special event will run that gives AD as rewards. All the AD you earn (except in the trade house) will be "Rough Astral
 Diamonds" and need to be refined in your inventory screen. You can refine 24k per day. Feel free to let me know if you need anymore help.</p>

<p>You should be able to make the purchase on the child account by giving parental consent. The other option would be to purchase a gift card for the child account.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You will need to follow some very specific instructions below to go to the customer support Windows Live account recovery:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Click on this&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><b>.</b><br />
2. Click on the third option:&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;I Think Someone Else is using my Windows Live ID.<br />
</b>3. Select&nbsp;<b>Reset your Password</b>&nbsp;option .<br />
4. Enter the Windows Live account you are trying to recover.&nbsp;<br />
5. Enter the characters you see on the picture, and then tick on&nbsp;<b>Next.</b><br />
6. Click on&nbsp;<b>Customer Support</b>.<br />
7. When a highlighted&nbsp;<b>Customer support</b>&nbsp;phrase appears, tick on it.<br />
8. Re-enter the Windows Live account you are trying to recover.<br />
9. Enter your alternate email address. ( Active email address that you have access to even if it's not associated with the account )<br />
10. Click on&nbsp;<b>Continue.</b>&nbsp;<br />
11. Validate your identity by providing as much information as you can on the&nbsp;<b><i>Recover your Windows Live account</i></b>&nbsp;page then click on&nbsp;<b>Continue</b>&nbsp;to submit.<br />
12. A page that says&nbsp;<b>Your information has been submitted&nbsp;</b>will appear, (just wait for the result of the account recovery request on your&nbsp;alternate email address)<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>To pass the validation process, you will need to provide as much precise information as possible. The more accurate your information is, the more likely you are to pass validation.<br />
<br />
These are essentially the same questions that phone support would have to ask you in order to return the account to you, but these go a bit more in depth, the more questions you can answer correctly the better chance you can get your password reset.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello.&nbsp; Sorry but Xbox Support can't reset your Password. &nbsp;Have you tried going here -
<a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../reset</a> &nbsp;What you can do is send some of the Windows Live Support team by filling out some information on a Form to try and get a Password reset.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You would also need to provide an Alternative Email address so that if they can verify the Account belongs to you so they can send you a Reset Password.&nbsp; Make sure you can provide as much Information as you can.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You would need to chose Customer Support option after you have entered the Email Address you have forgotten the Password for and entered the Captcha letters.</p>

<p><span>First some background...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I am running Windows Server 2008 / Hyper-V</span></p>
<p><span>I have a Vista guest OS that I loaded from a base image (vhd)</span></p>
<p><span>I also have a 2008 server guest OS also loaded from a base image</span></p>
<p><span>These images were not created on this machine.</span></p>
<p><span>I did have XP guest OS installed from CD but have since taken it off.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The machine this is all running on has a Intel
<span>&nbsp;</span>Core 2 X6800 2.93 GHz processor. </span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Core 2 X6800 2.93 GHz processor. </span></p>
<p><span>8GB DDR2 RAM</span></p>
<p><span>I have been having this problem for several weeks now.
<span>&nbsp;</span>At first <span>&nbsp;</span>I couldn't get the host OS to run updates it would fail with an error code of 80072EFE. This presisted for several weeks. Finally while researching this problem I stumbled across an entry mentioning that
<span>&nbsp;</span>At first <span>&nbsp;</span>I couldn't get the host OS to run updates it would fail with an error code of 80072EFE. This presisted for several weeks. Finally while researching this problem I stumbled across an entry mentioning that
 BITS needed to be running so I double checked it. Sure enough it was off. I started the service and that fixed the problem with the host OS and apparently problems it was having with other sites.</span></p>
<p><span>So I'm thinking great that's the issues with the Vista and the 2008 guest OS's. No such luck, these systems still will not run updates.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The 2008 OS returns an error "Windows could not search for updates" with an error code of 80072EE2</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>The 2008 OS returns an error "Windows could not search for updates" with an error code of 80072EE2</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried several solutions to this problem and at least twice have reloaded the base images because I had mucked about in the system so much that I had lost track of all the
 changes I had made to the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have run these commands ...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>regsvr32 /s wuapi.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wuaueng1.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wuaueng.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wucltui.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wups2.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wups.dll<br />
</span><span>regsvr32 /s wuweb.dll</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have also tried the procedure found here...</span></p>
<p><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-SG/vistawu/thread/6511a332-7de3-4f10-b823-49b6dae86b9c
</span></p>
<p><span>Which loads a new "TrustedInstaller.exe" to the folder "C:\windows\Servicing\"</span></p>
<p><span>And on the Vista OS I also tried this ...</span></p>
<p><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058
</span></p>
<p><span>Clicking the "Fix It" link.</span></p>
<p><span>Still not working.</span></p>
<p><span>Oddly though as I am typing this I had restarted the Vista guest OS and when it restarted it notafied me that it was installing updates 1 of 3. However when it finished I tried
 to check for updates and it gives me the same error "Windows cannot search for updates" with an error code of 80072EE2.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found an answer to this issue. I ask because as I research this I am seeing a lot of people with the same issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to Internet using Ralink 802.11n Wireless LAN card in an HP Touchsmart 320</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just bought an HP&nbsp;Touchsmart 320. I can´t access to the wireless network. The first Pc I bought was remplaced by other because Hp told that the card&nbsp; was damaged&nbsp; but the second PC has the same problem. The Card can detect the wireless network but with
 a very&nbsp;low signal and cannot access to it. I also update the driver and I did the two procedures that was documented&nbsp;in the related question. I have a Windows 7 64 bit. Can you help me please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Anne
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You need to stop using Windows Live Mail. Migrating to Windows Mail in Windows 10 is only part of the process. I am sure you have email messages in Windows Live Mail you would still like to access. For that, I recommend you download and install Mozilla Thunderbird.
<br />
<br />Thunderbird

<br />
<br />Source: Bruce Hagen, MVP
<br />
<br />Keep it for managing your old archive of Windows Live Mail.
<br />
<br />Next, start using and learning the basics of Windows Mail in Windows 10:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/getting-started-windows-mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/getting-starte...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still want to keep using Windows Live Mail, you probably will need to remove the offending update that is making it unstable. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is block the update for the time being and report it in the Feedback Hub so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

    <title>Trouble connecting to xbox from laptop on college wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack grotjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble connecting to xbox from laptop on college wifi</h2>
                    My college forces me to register our gaming devices. Once we do that, we are able to connect to a wired network (DeviceODU).&nbsp; However, they do not allow laptops to connect to DeviceODU. I was successfully able to connect my xbox to my xbox one app on my
 laptop via entering its ip address to connect for the first semester. However, after taking my xbox home for spring break, I bring it back and attempt to do the same thing, but this time, it cannot find my laptop by entering in its ip address. I think this
 is because the laptop and xbox are on two separate networks, but it had worked first semester, so I am wondering what has changed.

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. Try clearing the alt mac address on the console. Go to settings&gt;network&gt;network settings&gt;adv. settings&gt; alt mac address&gt;clear and restart. It still may be trying to pick up your home wifi not the college internet.</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, the Xbox app on your laptop is not recognizing your Xbox even when putting in the Xbox's IP address that you can find in the advanced network settings, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you may need to re-register your Xbox with your college's IT department because the Xbox is probably not on the same subnetwork your laptop is, since the network settings changed when you rook it home for spring break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend looking over <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-xbox-app-game-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Troubleshooting Xbox app game streaming on Windows 10"</a> just to make sure the basic set up is correct and if everything is good but your laptop can still not connect to the Xbox, then you'll need to make sure your Xbox is on the same network as your laptop
 with your college's IT department.</p>
<p>

<p>That is correct, I am putting in my Xbox's IP and it still cannot find it. I have just contacted the IT department and will see what they have to suggest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, Jack! As to your issue, ill be happy to assist you! Have you tried disconnecting your WiFi/Ethernet Cable? I notice you mentioned that it says that your console doesn't have an IP Address, try unplugging it for 1 minute and plug it back in. You can
 also go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Console Info and Press LB+RB+LT+RT to access developer settings, there you can check your console IP! If all else fails, try going to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network Settings&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;IP Settings and click Automatic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you run a ping from your laptop to the IP on your Xbox when at college.&nbsp; If you cannot you cannot route from the network the laptop is on to the gaming network for your Xbox.&nbsp; It will be due to your colleges network people most likely either putting
 up a firewall or just blocking the ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are at school you will have to get used to the Xbox APP not being able to connect.</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo viewer - Out of memory &#40;But i am not&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
When I try to open a pic windows starts photo viewer. Photo viewer then give's me this message:" Windows photo viewer can't display this picture because there might not be enough memory available on your computer. Close som programs that you aren't using or
 free som hard disk space (if it's almost full), and then try again.". <br />
The thing is I have got 20GB free on my hard disk and 1GB free RAM (of total 2GB). I can still play slide shows with the photo viewer.<br />
Anyone?

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586 update.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Broken Windows Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing some<em> very </em>annoying issues with Windows Update. Apparently, Windows downloaded an update named "Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586" some time ago, and previously failed to install it. Only recently has this update appeared
 again. Whenever I restart my PC to finish installing this update, it restarts as normal, but doesn't install at all. The best part about it, however, is that Windows will continue to schedule restarts to install, fail to install, and then repeat again, which--as
 you can imagine--limits what I can get done on my PC. Especially since I can't postpone the restart or stop it at all, as the check-box to do that is greyed out, as shown. I installed Windows 10 Home via a USB drive I purchased almost two months ago, onto
 the computer I built just over a month ago, so I can't roll back to a previously installed version of Windows. Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb03553e-8bc9-4495-bd8b-08028c388f20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb03553e-8bc9-4495-bd8b-08028c388f20" /></a></p>

            <p>Windows 10 November update is a major update to windows.</p>
<p>If you are having troubles with Windows update, use the ISO's to do an In-place upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Media creation Tool is now updated with Version 1511, OS Build 10586 of Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>Download link for Media Creation Tool:</p>

            <p><span>Hello Kenn,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, do you get any error message/error code when the update fails to install?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might be facing the above issue due to the corrupted <strong>Windows Update Components</strong> on your PC. Repairing the
<strong>Windows Update Components</strong> may help in resolving the issue. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Before fixing the corrupted update components, run the
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows update troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;and check for the corrupted/missing updates components on the
 PC. Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases will fix to enhance the performance of the system.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In many cases, the <strong>Windows Update</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with any update and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with downloading updates, this tool can automatically identify and
 fix some problems with downloading and installing the updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persist, fix the corrupted
<strong>Windows Update Components</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Stop</strong> the <strong>BITS</strong>, <strong>
Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>Windows Updates Services</strong> by entering the following command prompts in the
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop wuauserv</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop cryptSvc</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop bits</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop msiserver</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: Rename</span></strong><span> the </span><strong><span>SoftwareDistribution</span></strong><span> and
</span><strong><span>Catroot2</span></strong><span> folder by typing the following commands in the same window.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4: Restart</span></strong><span> the </span><strong><span>BITS</span></strong><span>,
<strong>Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>Windows Updates Services</strong> by entering the following command prompts in the Command Prompt (Admin) window.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start wuauserv</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start cryptSvc</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start bits</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start msiserver</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong><span>Wait for the process to complete.<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Close the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 5: Reboot</strong> the PC and check if the changes are effective.<br />

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I had been troubled by 1511 being available since 10 March but not downloading no matter how many times I restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:-</p>
<p>Did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:-</p>
<p>I followed these instructions and the only comment was when starting wuauserv it said it was already running.&nbsp; (It had reported that it had shut down successfully prior to renaming the two files)</p>
<p>On reboot, Windows Update took ages to check but is now saying it is Downloading the Windows Home, version 1511, 10586 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I posted, <strong>Method 2 </strong>as proposed by Likhitha V worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1511 10586 Update downloaded, gave me the option of changing the restart, but I chose 'Restart Now' and while it took quite some time, the update proceeded and completed normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly a much easier way than bothering with ISO files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers and thanks all for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D Wright</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have tried option 2 above, and can get to step 'net stop msiserver', but it says that I don't have the correct permissions. I am using the Command Prompt (Admin), but no luck.&nbsp;I have been struggling with this upgrade for months now. &nbsp;This is getting very
 frustrating!</p>
<p>Option 1 was unsuccessful. I don't want to completely reload Windows 10.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Barry</p>

            <p>Method 2-</p>
<p>My computer was stuck in a forced restart loop, and refused to let me rename SoftwareDistribution or catroot2 folders. I ended up solving this by restarting into Safe Mode with Command Prompt. From there I was able to stop the selected services, rename the
 folders, and then restart normally, which finally fixed the problem.</p>

            This was the only method that worked to get 1511.10586 installed, along with a bunch of other updates that were throwing errors. &nbsp;However, after all was said and done, I have gotten a few weird errors with respect to graphics drivers (Intel HD), but for
 now, &nbsp;those have seemed to disappeared. &nbsp;I also lost some of my custom settings, like power management and screen savers. &nbsp;But, it was a thousand times WORTH IT to get the updates installed and move on with my life - THANKS!

<h2>            Cannot install GPU device drivers. One of the installers for this device cannot perform the installation at this time</h2>
                    <p>After installing the windows october update today I've tried updating to the newest device driver version of my GPU.<br />
<br />
The vendor's device driver installer fails with a general 1603 error. Inspecting the log file it shows this entry at the point of error:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67d13cfa-1657-4c80-b76b-d31947c91712?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67d13cfa-1657-4c80-b76b-d31947c91712?upload=true" /></a><br />
When I try updating with windows device manager, I get the following error:</p>

</a>one of the installers for this device cannot perform the installation at this time</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried so far: (basically everything that is stated on this page:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-kb1603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-kb1603">AMD error page for 1603<br />

</span><span>- SFC /SCANNOW</span>Both returning without error.<br />
<br />
- Troubleshooter can't find errors, neither for WSUS, nor for Devices<br />
- reinstalling 2017 VS C++ Redist<br />
- several restarts and checking for new windows updates<br />
- Even older display drivers can not be installed any more<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what else I could try.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Enterprise version 1507&#47;10240 -- non-domain, KMS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve maser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Enterprise version 1507&#47;10240 -- non-domain, KMS Activated -- will it get the build 1511&#47;10586 update eventually&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have a number of deployments of the original version 1507/10240 of Windows 10 Enterprise. &nbsp; These machines all have local accounts, are not connected to a Domain, and are activated via KMS (not MAK) -- otherwise "standalone" Enterprise installs. &nbsp; All
 updates come from Windows Update -- not from WSUS/ConfigMgr or any other internal/centralized update server...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these machines have been prompted with the November 2015 "1511" update (version 10586) yet. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Over on TechNet, some people -- who have similar non-Domain, non-WSUS, etc, "standalone" machines -- have indicated that their *MAK-activated* version 1507/10240 machines -- started seeing the 1511 update in mid-December. &nbsp; KMS-activated machines -- have
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>(Yes, I could manually download the current 1511 .iso from our VLSC and manually upgrade these machines, but apparently every other stand-alone version of windows -- except KMS-activated ones -- are getting the 1511 update.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody from Microsoft have any idea if/when non-Domain, KMS-activated, Windows-Update-only-using Enterprise systems will receive the 1511/10586 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Re&#58; Uninstall &#47; reinstall Catalyst Control Center &#38; Catalyst Install Manager</h2>
                    
<p>Upgrading from Vista 64 bit to Win 7 64 bit. The Upgrade Advisor reccommends uninstalling both ATI products and reinstalling after the upgrade completes. ATI's knowledge base article GPU 57 suggests using the installed Catalyst Control Center 'Express Uninstall'
 option to remove all ATI software.<br />
<br />
Q1) If I follow&nbsp;ATI's suggestion, will I lose the Radeon HD 4650 display driver, thereby disabling the monitor?<br />
Q2) If&nbsp;I&nbsp;uninstall all the ATI software, download&nbsp;and reinstall the latest Catalyst Control Center and driver, where do I get the Catalyst Install Manager?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            The Catalyst Control Center is a seperate piece of software. You can uninstall Catalyst and just download and upgrade to the latest ATI (driver only) while still in Vista.<br />
<br />
Then do the Windows 7 upgrade and then download and install the "Full" Windows 7 Catalyst package which also &nbsp;includes the latest driver.<br />

    <title>How do I disable, automatic Pinch and Zoom without a mouse Device Tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eurekalink  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable, automatic Pinch and Zoom without a mouse Device Tab</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with an over sensitive Pinch and Zoom, on my Aspire|V laptop, (Windows 8.1), the screen regularly grows to the size of an elephant or reduces to a postage stamp of it's own accord, I am currently using a touch pad to navigate, but I
 only have to breath for it to resize.&nbsp; I need to manually change it back every few minutes, which gives me I have a short time to read an email for example, before it automatically resizes, it is impossible to use and it is driving me insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find how I can disable it, in the Device Manager listed under Human Interface Devices, is Synaptics HID device, which I think may be connected, but I can't find a way to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for possible solutions and so far found that I can turn off this feature via the 'Device' tab settings in the mouse properties, but the Device tab does not exist in my 'mouse properties'.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice on how to turn off this annoying automatic pinch and zoom.</p>

            <p>Are you wired or wireless? Wired through a ethernet cable always gives best open nat in my experience. However in the past when I have been wireless and had nat issues I found that testing the connection in settings resolved the issue. But I would recommend using ethernet if possible.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost uses the SysMain Service&nbsp;-&nbsp;SuperFetch&nbsp;in Windows 10<br />
which should be set to Automatic and Running.<br />
<br />
This should help :<br />

ReadyBoost in Windows 10<br />

You may need to contact the support for your USB device.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Yes and my sysmain and superfetch are running. If my drive isn't compatible it should notify me of that when I select the readyboost service for it. I don't even have that option because the readyboost tab isn't there. Nor is it listed in my list of services.
 Do I need to install the driver somehow? Are the files corrupted somehow? I have an error log for it that says it's been disabled. How do I enable it?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Does your system have a SSD? If so ReadyBoost is disabled since there is no<br />
advantage is caching it - the SSD is already faster than then ReadyBoost drive<br />
would be.<br />
