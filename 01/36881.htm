<h2>            Microsoft print to PDF</h2>
                    I have 22 images that I have been trying to combine to 1 PDF using Microsoft print to PDF.&nbsp; the file name shows up but there are no files in the folder.&nbsp; When the green bar starts to "print"&nbsp; it goes 1-22 but nothing copies.&nbsp; And when I say print I do
 not mean print a hard copy from my printer.&nbsp; I mean print to a PDF.&nbsp; This option is enabled on my computer.&nbsp; Windows 10 and Edge is horrible.&nbsp; Nothing but trouble

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if reinstalling Microsoft Print to PDF helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click Start, click Programs and Features</p>
<p>Click "Turn windows features on or off"</p>
<p>Uncheck Microsoft Print to PDF, and click OK.</p>
<p>Repeat the steps and enable Microsoft Print to PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, let's know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you recently relocate the TEMP folder by changing the TEMP &amp; TMP variables?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to print to PDF by running the respective program elevated (Run as administrator)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can try the 3rd party&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>CutePDF</strong></a>&nbsp;(free) printer driver.</p>

            <p>If the update was done in the last few months, the system should be able to Reset using the Windows version and not the OEM special keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made a recovery drive and deleted the Factory Image Recovery partition, then you need to use the Recovery drive to Reset, assuming it was made after the Upgrade to 8.1 with the Recovery Image present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attach a picture of your Disk Management window for us to confirm and then use the command below in an Administrative command&nbsp;prompt and include the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reagentc /info</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Refresh will not work because you do not have the 8.1 install files for the Refresh to use.&nbsp; There are

            <p>Your Recovery Tools are registered in the old recovery partition (900 MB).&nbsp; They should be registered in the new one (350 MB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a system that was updated during the time the 350 MB partition was being added, since they later changed to a 450 MB partition, which I have an works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not the first poster with this problem I have seen, unless you have posted in multiple forums.&nbsp; But some things are needed for the new Recovery Tools to function correctly to restore an 8.0 image.&nbsp; If you have them, we may be able to register the
 new Recovery tools and allow the system to Reset.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look in the Windows\System32 folder and see if you have a "Downlevel" folder.&nbsp; Next, if you have a Recovery Drive on which you copied the Recovery Image partition, check it for a Reagent.xml file and copy it to the Desktop and Edit.&nbsp; If you make a Recovery
 Drive, do not let it remove the Recovery Image partition.&nbsp; If it has an entry for Downlevel near the bottom of the listing, we can try to register the new Tools.&nbsp; If you do not have either of these things, it may not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:&nbsp; </strong>The other option does not appear to be viable.&nbsp; I will try again tomorrow, but since I do not have your exact configuration, I may not be able to duplicate the situation.&nbsp; You may have to end up reinstalling if necessary, how, not
 exactly sure.&nbsp; If you just had a Windows 8 Recovery Drive with the Recovery Image copied over, you could reset the entire drive.&nbsp; The next time you update to 8.1, the Reset should be operational...&nbsp; If it was me, and I could not get it to&nbsp;Reset, I would use
 DISM to apply the image to a formatted OS partition, then reset the&nbsp;EFI system partition.&nbsp; But that can be very complicated an probably beyond the scope of this forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>So you now have the option of applying the Windows 8 factory image to the OS partition, or trying to register&nbsp;the recovery tools which&nbsp;may be in your Added 350 MB partition.</p>

            <p>I ran this process on my system 4 times and it worked all four times, so I feel confident it will work for you.&nbsp; But I do not have an OEM system and there may be some differences, so still use your best judgment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This assumes the Factory Reset Image is still available.&nbsp; If you want to check, after you put the drive letter on the partition, you can use the
<em>dir /a</em> command to see the hidden folders and files.&nbsp; If the Install.wim file is still in the RecoveryImage folder, you are good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look it over and let me know if you have any concerns.&nbsp; I will be back in about 8 hours.&nbsp; I am having some problems copying the instructions due to no way to adjust the Font being used.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This process was written to help those who might be unable to Reset their systems after doing the 8 to 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp; The situation in this thread shows the Recovery Tools partition is still set to the Original Recovery Tools partition and a Reset is not
 possible.&nbsp; Most of these seemed to be ASUS folks, but I have now seen a Dell system with the same indications.&nbsp; The process is not hard to complete but you will need some experience with a Command Prompt Window.&nbsp; Make sure you try a Reset from within Windows
 first to make sure it will not work that way either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is being done on a UEFI install.&nbsp; Partitons will be different for a Legacy install, if you even have an Image to use to reset.</p>
<p>It is important you gather information prior to starting the process so it will be readily available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need:</p>
<p>The path to your Factory Reset image in the large Recovery partition.</p>
<p>The Index of the Factory Image you need to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you put spaces in the commands where needed, usually in front of /.&nbsp; It is not always easy to tell when reading a description such as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these are available in the listing from a <em>reagentc /info </em>command when run in an administrative command window.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The overall process involves getting into the Windows 8.1 Recovery Command prompt, the one you have to sign into.&nbsp; From there, you use Diskpart to list the Drive letters while in the Recovery environment, set a drive letter on the Recovery Image partition,
 and format and assign the letter C: to the OS partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you use DISM to apply the Factory image to the OS partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the image has been applied, you use a <em>bcdboot c:\Windows </em>command to refresh the BCD Store so you can reboot into Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try, we can get started.&nbsp; The disclaimer is something can always go wrong and you might loose your install.&nbsp; But protect your Factory image however you can.&nbsp; Try to make some type of bootable recovery media, and a System Image Backup would
 also be nice.</p>

</p><p>Open Diskpart.&nbsp; The Drive numbers and partition numbers you need to use may be different from mine.&nbsp; Check the listing to make sure you are working on the correct partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diskpart</p>
<p>list volume&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- use as a reference</p>

</p><p>Format the Windows partition:</p>

</em></p>
<p>format quick fs=ntfs&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&lt;-- formatting is not required, but allows a cleaner reset.&nbsp;
<strong>Once done, your install is&nbsp; gone, for now.</strong></em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>assign letter="C"</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now use <strong>DISM</strong> with the paths and index you should already have.&nbsp; For help, use DISM /Apply-Image /?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:R:\RecoveryImage\install.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it finishes, run this command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdboot C:\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>then reboot your system.&nbsp; You may need to check the Bios to make sure the correct boot device is set as first priority.&nbsp; But you should now be able to boot into Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cleanup:</p>
<p>After booting back into Windows 8, there may be some things you need to do or would like to do.&nbsp; One is to remove the small recovery partition after the OS partition.&nbsp; Use the same procedure as above in Diskpart to identify and
<strong>select </strong>that partition.&nbsp; Make very sure you are looking at the correct partition then use the
<em>del par override </em>command<em>.&nbsp; </em>Then use Disk Management to extend the OS partition into that unallocated space.&nbsp;
<em>It is not essential you remove the partition.&nbsp; </em></p>
<em><br />
</em>
<p>You also need to check <em>the reagentc /info </em>listing to see if the Factory Image is still registered.&nbsp; If it is not, use the command below to set it using the Administrative Command Prompt Window in Windows.</p>
<p>Assuming the Recovery Image partition still shows as R:, if it does not, use Diskpart to reassign it.&nbsp; Again, use your Path and Index numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>reagentc /setosimage /path R:\RecoveryImage /index 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to make sure it worked, then remove the drive letter from that partition.&nbsp; Use Diskpart to find the partition again, and instead of using assign letter="R", just use Remove.</p>

So I uninstalled and reinstalled the game in another directory, and I tried to remove the old exes from DEP<br />
<br />
I unchecked them, hit apply, remove them, hit apply, and then if reopen the DEP settings they are still there and checked, I even tried rebooting the computer and they are still there.<br />
<br />
My changes just don't get applied. So what do I have to do to remove the .exe's from the list? considering the program is uninstalled and does not exist, why are they not being removed?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t print to HP Printer, documents stuck in queue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rumpled103  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print to HP Printer, documents stuck in queue</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have an HP Deskjet 1000 printer. And I'm trying to print a Word document from my other computer, but it's not working. I checked the 'See what's printing' for that printer on the computer where I wanted to print from, and it shows a bunch of documents
 in queue. I tried to cancel or restart them, but nothing happens. I just get 'Error processing command'. I've already checked the C:\Windows\System32\Spool\PRINTERS, but there's nothing in it. I've already removed the printer and re-inserted it and it downloaded
 the drivers again. That all went well, but I still can't print from either computer (I have two). On the one computer where the printer is, if I try to print something, nothing happens, no documents in its queue. But from the other computer, it just keeps
 adding more documents to the queue and I can't do anything. I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium on both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 1: I was able to successfully clear the print queue from here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-forcefully-clear-all-jobs-from-a-print-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-</a></p>
<p>But now the problem is when I go to MS Word and go to File &gt; Print, it says 'Paper Out: 1 document waiting'. I'm wondering if this is what's causing the issue. I'm using an HP Deskjet 1000. And then if I try to print something from the computer with the
 printer, the print job will show up and then quickly disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: Ok, I solved this by removing the printer in Devices and Printers. When I added it back, it installed a driver that wasn't there and that finished. Then I tried to print something and it actually got the print job. Now the issue is whenever I push
 the power button and making sure it grabs the paper, it doesn't actually print out what I wanted it to print. Also, I'm trying to install the drivers for the printer and it says "Connect the square end of the USB cable to the back of the printer and the flat
 end of the cable to any available USB port on this computer". Well, I have it physically connected, but it's not detecting it. The drivers are for Deskjet 1000 J110.</p>

            Hi Honorio,
<br />
<br />If System restore is turned on, you can restore the system previous to that unnistallation.
<br />
<br />type on the Search Menu "System Restore" then click on "create a restore point"
<br />
<br />Go to System Protection tab, click on system restore.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />

<h2>            text-to-speech button not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed TTS engine for a non-enlish language on my machine from microsoft download website. As suggested, I also installed speech engine platfrom first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing both the platform and language engine in the same order, I opened MS-Word and added speak scommand to quick access bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I typed some words and selected the phrase. After that I clicked on the speak command button. But there is no audio autput after that. Also when I take the mouse over the speak button it shows "stop speaking selected text". And it keeps showing it everytime
 I move my mouse over that button. So when I click on the button again it comes back to the play mode.</p>
<p>I am not able to understand why I am not able to hear any audio. Is it even playing it, because the button hangs in the playing mode after I click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how can I confirm that the language engine has been installed successfully on my pc as it did not show any confirmation when I installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Skype Profile in relation to Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I am currently having a dilemma with the setup of my Microsoft account. I wish to keep all things attached to the account such as the Xbox profile and all products I have bought using the account, but I would like to delete my skype account. In my search
 for an answer on how to do this, I found that you have to delete your entire Microsoft account if you wish to do so. This is said to make the overall experience for general users easier but it also makes it much harder for users who wish to make changes to
 their accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that it is currently not possible to unlink my Microsoft and Skype accounts, but my question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible for me to transfer my Xbox Profile and all Microsoft Suite features attached on to my current Microsoft account to a different Microsoft account and then to delete the current Microsoft Account and therefore deleting the Skype account
 while keeping all of the data and products attached to the current account safe from the account closure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows a method easier than this please let me know.</p>

</p><p>It is true that there's no option to revert the action&nbsp;when a Skype account has been linked to a Microsoft account, thus it's not possible to unlink the accounts. Deleting the Microsoft account connected to your Skype and vice versa will close both accounts
 including all the Microsoft services connected to it.</p>

            <p>I get the <strong>exact </strong>same results with the exact <strong>error </strong>
message.&nbsp; You can find this same issue within</p>
<p>100's of posts to this forum.&nbsp; Some state the problem differently but it is the same error.&nbsp; The problem</p>
<p>never happens if the photo attachments are in JPG format.&nbsp; It should also be said that
<strong>all </strong>the photos are always shown in the received email.&nbsp; The problem only occurs when the email is
<strong>forwarded</strong>.&nbsp; I did find out that once I select forward a new window opens showing the forwarded message.&nbsp; At this point</p>
<p>if I want the images to appear in the body of the&nbsp;forwarded email I right click on the photo and save it to the desktop.&nbsp;This option is not available when I click on the photo in the
<strong>original</strong> email. The only option available is <strong>select all.&nbsp;
</strong>At this point I cut the original images from the email I am going to forward and paste the new JPG from my desktop and all is OK.&nbsp; I am not saying that this is a solution.&nbsp; I offer it in the hope that someone who understands the&nbsp; issue may have an
 answer.&nbsp; Aditionally, this happens on many different emails from different senders, but never on a JPG or GIF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last point I am using Windows <strong>Live</strong> Mail not the standard Windows Mail.&nbsp; Within Windows mail</p>
<p>everything works OK</p>

    <title>Why was dreamscene removed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why was dreamscene removed&#63;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Vista ultimate to Win 7 ultimate RTM <br />
<br />
i'm very disappointed that dreamscene was removed in favor of being able to have a slideshow of pictures as a background instead!<br />
<br />
I know it's a little thing, but it was very cool to be able to have video backgrounds and replacing it with a picture slideshow seems to be a step backwards in my opinion.
<br />
<br />
I can see adding the slideshow option in addition to dreamscene, but taking it out completely doesn't make alot of sense.
<br />
<br />
Just wondering if someone from microsoft can chime in as to the reasoning behind why dreamscene was removed.
<br />

            Microsoft has not provided any reasoning as to why Dreamscene and Ultimate Extras are not a part of this release. If you would like to use the motion wall papers on Windows 7, there is a work around:<br />

<p><br />
And those manufacturers (of those products) support Windows 7?</p>
<p>It is the manufacturer's of the products (hardware and software) that determine the compatibility with a given operating system - not the operating system manufacturers.&nbsp; Although most have 'compatibility wizards' and the likes that try and fool a given
 application or even software to manage a hardware device into thinking you are running an older version of the operating system than you are - in the end, if the software or hardware manufacturer of the product in question does not support a particular product
 (or version of said product) under a given operating system - it's either 'figure out a way to hack it for now' and hope for the best or change products.</p>

<p>Last time I checked, USB-C should be universal right? So why would it not work on a Surface Book 2 then? It's a bit strange to me that Microsoft accessories work better / are more compatible on non-Microsoft devices than on actual Microsoft branded devices.</p>

            No version of Windows has ever included any Office products unless the Vendor decided to bundle them.<br />
And yes Office 2003 will run OK on Windows 7.
