<h2>            BitLocker stalled while decrypting at 97.4&#37; for 3days and counting after disabling Bitlocker</h2>
                    <p><span>After locking my external storage drive with </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Bitlocker, I decided to turn it off because it was annoying me how slow the files were being read. After turning it off, it began to decrypt
 the drive. It has stuck on 97.4% ever since for 3 days. At one point the drive disappeared in the midst of me trying to access it. My plan is to copy all the files off from the drive (even this is taking an abnormal amount of time) and format the drive...so
 I'm stuck all around. I'm frustrated and upset with Microsoft and its Bitlocker at moment....wish I never used it. I cant work on my projects.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there any thing I can do anyone? Please see the attached screen shot below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is it ok if I restart and attempt to rename the external storage drive? Can this solve the issue?</span></p>

<h2>            100 PERCENT DISK USAGE ON WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>For me the best solution was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Update ur driver with a driver updater programme. Disable the programme once the update is complete (remove it from startup programme)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Disable any scheduled windows disk defragmentation.&nbsp; Go to C: (system drive) properties /tools/optimize and defragment drive/optimize and then disable any scheduled defragmentation&nbsp;on the drive. Disable any other programme used to defragment the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Use a programme to clean up ur hard disk .Delete contents of %temp% and temp folder. This can be done by pressing windows+r key and entering the folder name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.Restart ur system in recovery mode by either entering the recovery drive or by booting from a windows installation disk at boot time. After entering recovery mode go to troubleshoot and open command prompt .Move to system drive c:(in my case) enter command
 chkdsk c:&nbsp;/f/r/x .check each volume with this command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.Restart after the above is complete and defragment ur drives .</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.Disable any startup programme which is not required by u every time u log in to windows .Use task manager startup tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.Restart .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this will solve the problem .</p>

    <title>Win 10 boot manager GUI menu, no mouse pointer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_denton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 boot manager GUI menu, no mouse pointer</h2>
                    <p>I have a machine with three Windows 10 partitions. When I boot I get the boot manager menu but there is no mouse pointer displayed. If I wobble the mouse around it will eventually intersect a menu entry and highlight it. I can then click and boot that menu
 item. So I have a mouse pointer but it isn't displayed. I can also do a work around using the Tab and Arrow keys. No big problem just an inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I clean installed (booted from a USB) one of the partitions and I got my mouse pointer back. However, it only showed the pointer when the new system was the default boot. When I changed the default boot to either one of the other systems then I lost
 the mouse pointer. The other two systems were upgrade installs from Win 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop which was also upgraded from Win 8.1. I forced it to show a boot menu and it had no mouse pointer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not about to go and clean install the three systems that were upgraded. That would be an unnecessary pain. However, it would be nice to easily use the mouse again in the boot menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are able to access the mouse pointer on Windows 10 boot menu, this might&nbsp;be a new&nbsp;feature added on Windows 10. The prior version of Windows doesn't had this feature. The only way we can access boot menu is by using arrow keys.&nbsp;I suggest you to contact
 your Computer manufacturer for more information on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope this information helps. Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></span></p>

            <p>I don't understand your answer. Can you explain further please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are suggesting that I have a hardware problem let me point out that I have a 5 year old home built desktop with an ASUS motherboard, a Dell display, a Logitech keyboard and mouse. They all worked happily on Win 7 Pro, Win 8 Pro, Win 8.1 Pro,&nbsp;and then
 failed on Win 10 Pro. One failing partition has Win 10 x86 and the other x64. The non failing&nbsp;partition is Win 10 Pro x64. Those were all retail versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other machine was a laptop which&nbsp;worked happily on OEM Win 8.1 x64, retail Win 8.1 Pro x64, and then failed on retail&nbsp;Win Pro x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My belief is that there is a Windows software problem which inhibits the mouse pointer when I do an upgrade install to Win 10.</p>

    <title>Lost or Corrupted WLMP file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fern_ivy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost or Corrupted WLMP file</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I'm using Windows 7 with Windows Live Media Maker.&nbsp; I have been working on an extremely long, complex movie project.&nbsp; I've invested several days.&nbsp; My blood, sweat and tears are in this damn project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program crashes often, and for that reason, I make saves after every single change I make.&nbsp; I had 138 carefully trimmed video clips that were around 15 minutes in total.&nbsp; At one point, about an hour ago, the program crashed and I stupidly agreed to save
 it before forcing it closed.&nbsp; Now, whenever I open the project file, it show's "20 of 138" at the lower left and it says that the movie's length is 3:18.69.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, all I got was the cursor and a bunch of white space where the video clips were supposed to be.&nbsp; When I hit play, the tracker would move, but nothing would display in the preview.&nbsp; After closing and opening the project file a couple of times,
 eventually 20 of the thumbnails reappeared and are now preview-able.&nbsp; The cursor/tracker thing plays farther ahead.&nbsp; The 20th clip ends at the 1:40 mark, but the project keeps on playing the "invisible" clips past that point, until it reaches the 3:18 mark,
 at which point it seems to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to recover my data, I only had one option for recovery (and that was a version of the project file from about 7 hours before the crash (I'd been working on it that entire time D:) so I think it loaded in an autosave from my appdata.&nbsp; Is there
 any way to get a later save back that I might not know about?&nbsp; I don't have system restore enabled and when I tried to recover previous versions it said there were none available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to export the project as a movie file and ended up with a perfectly fine file- but, as I feared, it was only 3:18 long.&nbsp; I think around 46 of the original 138 clips made it into the export.&nbsp; I'd really, really like to get the other ~90-100 lovingly
 ordered/edited clips back.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebecca</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; When I zoomed in all the way on the pane with all the thumbnails, the missing clips reappeared.&nbsp; I can trim them, but I can't interact with them in any way.&nbsp; I can't play/preview them, copy, select, etc.&nbsp; I saved the project file under a new name
 hoping this would help, but no luck.&nbsp; I'm encouraged to find that they're still in there (sort of).&nbsp; I just don't know how to make it so that I can use this file.</p>

<p>When Movie Maker crashes in this fashion, it corrupts the project file. There are ways for you to try to manually "uncorrupt" the file but it's a time-consuming process. I've done it previously for others but I'm not feeling like doing this manually for
 a project containing 138 clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is your project, you might be willing to do this, so let me give you the steps I would perform:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a *copy* of the original project and only work in the copy. Leave the original corrupted file as a backup and don't touch it in case you need to start over. If that happens, again work with a *copy*.</li><li>Open up the project with Notepad or a similar text editor like Notepad++.</li><li>Search for any instances of the string 'outTime='. If the number that follows is 0 or otherwise smaller than the 'inTime=' value on the same line, that's going be considered an invalid clip with a negative duration. You need to edit the outTime value to
 make it bigger than the inTime value.</li><li>Once you have found all the problem clips, save the text file (still with the same extension of .wlmp) and try opening the project again in Movie Maker.</li><li>If it opens, you'll still have to manually review all the clips that were edited and probably have to trim their endpoints to the actual point you wanted.</li></ol>
<p>Here are some pointers for avoiding this in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with smaller projects. If you have too many clips in a single project, Movie Maker is more likely to crash. You can always work with several *sub-projects*, save them separately as a movie and then join the movies together at the end in a final master
 project.</li><li>Save frequently and with a *different* name each time. For example, if you were saving as Project001, Project002, Project003, etc. and it fails in Project047, you could just go back to Project046 to hopefully lose only a few minutes of editing rather than
 everything.</li></ul>

    <title>Disappeared Message Boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omnidekka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappeared Message  Boxes </h2>
                    When certain&nbsp;message boxes appear in windows, you sometimes get the option to tick a box saying "do not show this&nbsp;message again". If you do this, how do you re-enable the&nbsp;message boxes?&nbsp;&nbsp;The one in question concerns the System Configuration Utility (msconfig).
 If you make any changes in msconfig, you are given the option to exit with or without restarting. If you restart, you are given a message telling "you have made changes to the System Configuration Utility, do you want save them?"&nbsp; or something like that. This
 is the message I must of ticked by accident not to show again &amp; I would like to re-enable it. Any ideas how I can do this or any other similar messages? Is just a registry tweak?

            Hi....well I cannot explain why its doing that, however, if you recreate that entry in the Registry again, you can Export that key to your desktop or Documents folder<br />
then double click on that .reg file each time you go playing with the MSconfig program<br />
<br />
I know that's not a "Fix" but it will work ;)<br />

<h2>            Making videos stream better</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span>I run Windows 7 on an HP laptop with 2 gigs of RAM<br />
<br />
Okay, with what I have, are there any tweaks I can make to allow, say, YouTube to stream without constantly rebuffering<br />
<br />
During the early morning, things stream fine, so obviously in the evening when so many are online my connection is slow<br />
<br />
Is it possible to tweak something so the buffer&nbsp;will fill up, then YouTube plays, while the buffer refills without interruptions<br />
<br />
Hopefully this makes some sense to you, so maybe you can provide a suggestion<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Streaming online video is bandwidth-intensive. If your internet connection can't keep up with the stream rate of the video, repeated buffering is to
 be expected.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If we assume that the problem is just WMP isn't correctly detecting your internet bandwidth, go to media player menu Tools -&gt; Options -&gt;Performance,
 and click "choose connection speed" followed by setting the dropdown box to DSL/Cable (768kbps) which should be enough for most video online.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also use third party application that might boost the streaming speed. You may use you favorite search engine to search for such application.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent
 your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            SATA Drives &#40;Hard Disk and&#47;or CD-ROM&#47;DVD-RW&#41; not recognised - possible fix.</h2>
                    
<p><span>I had the following problems with recognition of internal SATA drives on an ASRock K10N78 motherboard/Windows 7 64-Bit (not that the problem has anything to do with Windows).
 This may help one or two people.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>1.)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span>SATA drives not recognised in BIOS during boot sequence.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>My IDE hard disk was recognised every time, but I had to re-enter BIOS and keep reconfiguring and restarting the PC to get the SATA Hard Drive (i.e. my boot drive) and SATA
 DVD-ROM Drive to be recognised. All my attempts to cure this via BIOS settings failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Solution:</strong> Eventually it became clear that the problem was due to motherboard issues (I had bought an “as-new” mobo that was clearly
 not fully operational). When I replaced the mobo, the PC booted up first time (once I had been into the BIOS and selected the correct boot drive, naturally).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>SATA DVD-ROM drive not recognised at all.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>On the new motherboard, the SATA HDD was working fine, but it was only when I tried to load some tracks from a CD that I noticed that the SATA DVD-ROM was not being recognised
 in Device Manager. The drive had power, as I was able to insert discs, but no data was getting to the PC. Again this turned into a time-consuming and frustrating goose-chase.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Eventually I noticed in BIOS
<span>&nbsp;</span>that for some reason only 4 of my 6 SATA connectors on my motherboard were being recognised in “Performance IDE/SATA mode”. MY DVD-ROM was connected to one of the two that was not listed. After a lot of messing about with trying different
<span>&nbsp;</span>that for some reason only 4 of my 6 SATA connectors on my motherboard were being recognised in “Performance IDE/SATA mode”. MY DVD-ROM was connected to one of the two that was not listed. After a lot of messing about with trying different
 modes in order to “recapture” all 6 SATA connectors (e.g. AHCI, which necessitated a couple of start-up repair sequences and got me nowhere – which was unusual as the previous, faulty motherboard has seemed to be okay with AHCI mode), it became apparent that
 the only thing to do was to connect the DVD-ROM to one of the 4 SATA connectors that was listed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The DVD-ROM then worked perfectly! I do not know why all 6 connectors were not recognised. Right now, I’m just glad to have a PC that works!</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong> Check your SATA connectors first and ensure that the drive is connected to one that is listed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            My computer types &#34;q&#34;s whenever constantly for no reason.</h2>
                    I have tried just about everything but reinstalling the OS.&nbsp; No matter what I am doing, anywhere there is a text box (internet, Word, even in video game controls) my computer inputs the letter "q" it will input many at once. This is accompanied by the
 same "ding" sound that occurs with an error or when you over fill a text box in an online form.&nbsp; This makes it virtually impossible to type when it is happening.&nbsp; It comes and goes daily. Things that activate it seem like prolonged computer use and if the
 computer has been sitting still for a while moving the mouse seems to bring it back to pressing q's.<br />
<br />
I have already swapped out keyboards, that is not relevant, the keyboard can even be unplugged.<br />
I have already uninstalled/reinstalled/updated keyboard and mouse drivers.<br />
I have already swapped mouses as well because I read that this problem has been attributed to logitech mouses at times which I had.<br />
<br />
All in all, I do not know what else to try, but it is the most annoying little thing a computer could do.<br />

            It may be a malware/virus or key-logger/hijacker.&nbsp; Have you run a full boot time scan with your Anti-Virus ?<br />
If that does not find anything, download&nbsp; MalwareBytes&nbsp; to cross check <br />

Have a look at your Startup programs list to see if there is something launching with Windows<br />
that looks suspicious ( type&nbsp; msconfig into the Start menu Run command or Search Bar to<br />
open System Configuration). If so disable it and try to find it's location so you can uninstall/remove it.<br />

<p>To understand what's causing this, may we still like to know if you are using a laptop or a desktop? If you're using a desktop computer, we suggest that you unplug your keyboard first and check if the screen will still keep on scrolling down. If the issue

    <title>After Windows 8.1 update, HP dv6 laptop won&#39;t charge the battery. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After Windows 8.1 update, HP dv6 laptop won&#39;t charge the battery.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: hp dv6 not charging after update </p>
<p>I made the latest updates to my windows 8.1 two days ago (January 15, 2014). After restart my hp dv6 laptop won't charge the battery. It shows that the battery is full but not plugged in. I continue to use the AC power. If I disconnect the AC power it uses
 the battery and if I reconnect it goes back to use the AC but says that the laptop is not plugged in. Only if I completely remove the battery it shows the plugged in sign. I tried the battery and the charger on another laptop and they are working fine. I made
 many restarts and removed the battery and put it back again but could not solve the problem. I uninstalled the updates and restored to earlier date without success. Any help?</p>

<p>It was originally running windows 7 home premium which later upgraded to win 8 pro them win 8.1 pro. I have all drivers up to date as per hp and Microsoft and I did not do any modifications for the drivers.</p>
<p>I did the battery test which told me that the battery is functioning fine but <u>
not plugged in</u>&nbsp;though the laptop was plugged in&nbsp;and consuming power from the AC not the battery. The battery indicator shows that the battery is not plugged in but no power consumption from the battery as long as the laptop is plugged in. The indicator
 shows the plug only if the battery is totally removed from the device.</p>

            I checked with HP and I found that I have the latest drivers. I re-installed the BIOS and the chipset driver but no change. Another problem occurred after the update&nbsp;that the equation editor in my office 2013 pro stopped working. Now I see some squares
 instead of&nbsp;the equations in my office documents and if I try to use the eq. editor the document freezes and the word closes. I tried repair office&nbsp;without success. I uninstalled and re-installed office, again no success. I did the suggestions I read about
 this problem in this forum without success. I hope this chain of failures stop at this stage and I hope that Microsoft fix this in the next update. I am in the middle of very important work and I do not have time to format my laptop or even refresh it though
 I am not sure if I refresh it should I refresh it on win 8.1 or should I go back to windows 7 and restart from there.

            I have been having the SAME problem since updated my Toshiba Laptop (windows 8) to system 8.1<br />
<br />
The battery does NOT charge, yet the meter in the bottom right says "battery 70%, charging"<br />
<br />
I can attest that the battery is neither 70% nor charging. If I pull the AC plug, the laptop dies immediately.&nbsp; I have tried all of the advice given here. I have also taken the painstaking approach of re-installing Windows 8 and all of my programs and apps.&nbsp;
 Did NOT fix it, still cant charge the battery.<br />
<br />
My brand new two-month old laptop is now a desktop that has to stay plugged in to use it. Very frustrating. I do not plan on ever buying another windows product if I can help it.

            <p>I have updated from windows 8&nbsp;to windows 8.1 on the consent that the drivers are the same. Apparently now Microsoft is telling me that I need special drivers for windows 8.1 different from those for windows 8 which HP does not seem to have or even going
 to have in the future.</p>
<p>I updated to 8.1 when the update came out some time ago and every thing was compatible and fine. Now they decided to make some more changes that require me to get new drivers???? what is that!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I always keep every thing in my computer up to date. That includes operating system, drivers, and software. That some time puts me in trouble when one of those problem updates comes out like that last update. I could however find, in your community,&nbsp;a solution
 for the eq. editor problem in office 2013 that to install the compatibility pack which solved the problem but the battery charging problems still persists. By the way I have all updates of all sorts&nbsp;installed no updates are available for my computer.</p>

<h2>            Windows update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running, You may need to restart your computer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have windows 7. Been having issues and someone told me I should check if the updates have been updating. It IS set to do it on auto but after looking I haven't gotten any since 2013. When I try to check for updates it tells me "Windows update cannot currently
 check for updates because the service is not running, You may need to restart your computer." I have restarted, completely shut down and rebooted and still get the same thing.</p>

            Hi Erline,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
You can make adjustments to your display to improve its brightness or contrast by using the controls that are usually found on the front of the monitor, but keep in mind that these adjustments will be less refined than if you use a calibration program.<br />
<br />
You'll get the best results when adjusting your monitor by using a calibration program. There are a number of programs available to help you optimize your monitor's display. They usually work in conjunction with a device that temporarily attaches to the front
 of your monitor to read light and color levels and automatically make changes to your monitor's display.<br />
<br />
Check out the link below that talks about Adjust your monitor's brightness and contrast<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Adjust-your-monitors-brightness-and-contrast
<br />
<br />
When it comes to sound, perform the following steps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Open Volume Mixer</strong> by clicking the<strong> Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong> , clicking <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> , and then, under<strong> Sound</strong> , clicking
<strong>Adjust system volume.</strong> <br />
<br />
Move the slider to get a sound of your choice.<br />
<br />
Check out the link below that talks about <strong>Tips for fixing common sound problems</strong>
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a>
<br />
<br />
You can also make adjustments on your speakers by reading through the manual guide.<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard doesn&#39;t work on Windows 10 tablet</h2>
                    <p>I have a Teclast X80HD tablet.</p>
<p>It has dual boot - Windows and Android.</p>
<p>I have a generic bluetooth keyboard.</p>
<p>The keyboard works fine on Android, but on Windows 10, it says paird, but when i type nothing happens.</p>
<p>I think at the beginning when I just installed it, it did type for a few seconds (but maybe I don't remember correctly).</p>
<p>What can I do to make it work?</p>

<h2>            Windows Stock Apps &#38; Store not Working</h2>
                    <p><strong>Windows Stock Apps not Working</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my Windows 10, Updating it from the setting wasn't working so finally i used&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 Update Assistant&nbsp;</strong>which worked fine Windows 10 Updated then it restarted from that moment on none of the Windows Stock Apps aren't
 working that wasn't the only problem the Bluetooth won't even discover any devices nor connect to the Paired ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i connected to the internet again the Bluetooth Started Pairing New devices but won't show the parried one &amp; won't connect to m Bluetooth Headphones so i left it along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 weeks i was using the internet and suddenly in the Notification bar the Parried Devices started to appear saying device added. Since then the Bluetooth is working fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Windows 10 Stock Apps ( Movies &amp; TV , Store &amp; etc) aren't working i have tried this method that i saw on YouTube it includes Windows Powershell</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Which ended not working with this error On Windows Powershell</p>

<p>Hi MOTi_1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running the Windows Store apps troubleshooter, did you get any errors? If so, kindly send a screenshot.&nbsp;<span>Select the&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>button
 &gt;&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><strong>Settings</strong></span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Update
 &amp; Security</strong></span></span></span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><strong>Windows Store Apps</strong></span></span></span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to clear and reset the Windows Store cache.&nbsp;<span><span><strong>WSReset</strong></span></span>&nbsp;is a built-in program present in Windows 10 which can be used to clear and reset Windows Store cache. This utility will clear Windows
 Store and app cache files. Since it deletes all cache files of Windows Store, there are chances that it'll fix your Windows Store related problems. You may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type&nbsp;<span><span><strong>cmd</strong></span>&nbsp;</span>in the search box, then select&nbsp;<span><span><strong>Command Prompt</strong></span></span>.</li><li>Type:&nbsp;<span><span><strong>WSReset.exe</strong></span></span></li><li>Allow the process to complete, then restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing works, the issue could be attributed to a corrupted user profile. Create a new user profile with administrator privileges or if you have a spare admin account, you can log in to that account and create a new user account. Once you have
 verified that the issue was due to a corrupted user profile, you can transfer your data from the old user account to the newly created one.<br />
</p>
<p>If you need further assistance with transferring your data from the old account, just let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update.&nbsp;Background Intelligent Transfer Service or BITS helps in the transfer, download or upload of files between a client and server, and provides progress information related to the transfers. It also plays a role in the download of files.
 This Windows Service is essential for Windows Updates to work properly.<br />
<br />
If BITS can’t be started for some reason, first make sure it is enabled.&nbsp;To open Windows Services, press
<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong><em>services.msc</em></strong>, and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. Look for <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service or BITS</strong>&nbsp; and if it’s not set to
<strong>Manual</strong>, change it to <strong>Automatic</strong>. Make sure that the service is running. If the service is configured correctly, but BITS will still not start properly, check to make sure none of the dependent services are disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure all of the following are set to <strong>Automatic</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Terminal Services</li><li>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</li><li>System Event Notification</li><li>Windows Management Instrumentation Driver Extensions</li><li>COM+ Event System</li><li>DCOM Server Process Launcher</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

            Hi BMGBALLER
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's execute following steps for this problem if above doesn't solve your problem. Please update me once done.
<br />
<br />1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to invoke Task Manager &gt; Go to the “Processes” tab &gt; See which programs are currently running in the background of the system and     If you found an app that uses Camera, end that program
<br />
<br />2. Switch Off your Antivirus temporarily and check. Switch On antivirus when testing is over.
<br />
<br />3. Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices
<br />Locate your Webcam
<br />Right click &gt; Roll Back
<br />If Roll back doesn't work - Right click &gt; Update Driver
<br />If above doesn't work, go to your computer manufacturer's website, download latest webcam driver and install
<br />

            Since this is under warranty, I would suggest that you should ask Acer to correct this. This is the safest way. Driver support for this model is very average.

<p>Last night after using my 360 slim, I turned it off properly (actually saw the xbox completely shut down). Today as I went to go turn it on, I noticed that the fan was still running (presumably overnight) even though the 360 was completely off (no lights,
 AC brick was orange status). I found this very weird but went ahead to turn it on with the controller anyway. As it powered up I noticed that the green dot in the center of the power button turned on but the normal boot up green ring sequence around it didn't
 happen and there was no response on my HDTV. After multiple attempts at turning it off and on using the controller and manually pressing the power button, no dice. I then detached all wires and let the xbox rest because as I mentioned earlier, the exhaust
 fan had been running when I went to play this morning. After an hour, I reconnected everything back up and started fresh.....still same issue and the AC brick turns from orange to green as I turn the xbox on.</p>
<p>Just as a sidenote, which might be relevant, in the past during long sessions (3-5 hours), my xbox would freeze during gaming so I would turn it off and let it rest. As I did, I noticed the cooldown light blinking slowly and the fan running slowly as well.
 This has happened about 8 times since i purchased it new on 11/2011.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm really bummed out and to anyone who can help me resolve this situation I would be truly grateful. Thanx a million in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you have a hard drive and or any external USB devices connected to the console could you try removing those and see if the console then boots up please. Also if you could remove the power lead and press the power button a few times and then connect the
 power cable and try your console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It's also worth checking that your tv is on the correct input that you are using for the console, my console looks like its not powered on until I change the input on my tv.</p>

<p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I decided to have it serviced which I didn't want to do because of possible repair and/or parts costs and transportion hassle.</p>
<p>Forturnately, my xbox 360 slim's warranty is still in effect and the process of having it repaired is way easier and cheaper than I thought. I simply registered my console @ xbox.com, completed an online repair form, then took the console (totally bare of
 accessories, including hard drive) to a FedEx shipping store in my area. I provided the clerk with an RTM number, which is provided at the end of completing the online repair form, and he took care of packing and shipping my console to the repair center. Shipping
 was free as a part of the warranty but the packaging was not. I simply paid about $10 to have it packaged and I left with my receipt and tracking number for the package. According to the clerk, he has done alot of xbox console shipments which had me somewhat
 baffled as to how many other people experience the same problem that I have. He assured me that it would take 1-2 weeks for the console to comeback.</p>
<p>I hope my experience helps anyone else in concern with sending the console out for repair. Very easy process as long as you have a warranty still valid and $10. Will post again with any updates in the near future.....</p>

<p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p>I tried to check on the webpage provided to check on the progress of my Xbox's repair/shipment but unfortunately, the page has not shown a single update since the process of having it repaired began. Not cool....</p>
<p>I took it upon myself to track it via Fedex's tracking number and it has arrived as of Tuesday but now the status lies in the void until I receive some sort of correspondence on the status of the repair progress.</p>
<p>For now, I just wait......</p>

<p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p>OK. Today marks a very important occasion....the return of my serviced Xbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(oh yeah, plus it's Election Day so get out there and vote for what it's worth)</p>
<p>Return shipment tracking from Fedex indicate's that my delivery arrives sometime today. 2 weeks, 4 days, and smaller increments of time from the day I shipped it to be serviced, to the return of my Xbox 360 S.....not bad considering the catastrophic effect
 of Hurricane Sandy. I consider myself to be extremely lucky as I live in one of the extremely small areas in my town to have not been severely affected. All my utilities remained intact including: gas,electric,cable,internet, and surprisingly mobile phone
 service. No major property damage except for a few panels of siding that were ripped from my house. My thoughts to all those affected in any way shape or form. It was a mess but as always, people will always rise above hardships through unity and resourcefulness.
 But I digress....</p>
<p>Will update with the results of the repairs later today and any relative information. Keeping em' crossed...</p>

<p>***FINAL UPDATE***</p>
<p>Unpacked box, set up, hit the power button........ALL SIGNS ARE GREEN!!</p>
<p>Even though everything went well, I was a bit nervous/wary of how the process would play out. I was a bit worried when I realized that my xbox repair service was outsourced to Mexico (for lower cost of operation, I'm guessing) but realizing that all countries
 have their strengths and weaknesses, I do not discount any particular race/heritage of people becoming greater than the status quo's expectations. Nonetheless, I was very happy with the resolvement of my original issue and couldn't be happier about it.
</p>
<p>The quality of care that was put into the shipment was nearly top notch. Included was a letter relating about the work put in and the hope of my personal satisfaction with the quality and results of the repair. An added bonus was a voucher for a free month
 of Xbox Live Gold redeemable online which surprised me. It will be a great use to add a free month to my already active subscription. For future reference, I would hope that Microsoft would include what the actual problem was with my Xbox and some sort of
 diagnostic report into the operational quality of my Xbox.</p>
<p>All in all, the experience from the beginning to the end of the repair process was easier to bear knowing my console was in the trusted hands of Microsoft instead of a third-party repair service. I recommend to leaving the repair process to the creators
 of the damaged product as they have the resources and up-to-date knowledge to optimize the final results.
</p>
<p>I hope these reports of my personal experience with this issue will help others to be at ease and more knowledgeable in the repair process. Also, to join in sharing experiences in a more objective than subjective manner to give a clear sense to those who
 are new to the experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I just want to say.... I am happy with the results. </p>
<p>Thank you to all those involved who made this possible.</p>

    <title>Cortana Replaced by Search Icon Unable to Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hissysnake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Replaced by Search Icon Unable to Restore</h2>
                    <p>Recently I realized that my Cortana icon had become a magnifying glass instead. I assumed that I had turned her off at one point, but quickly found out that my ability to reactivate her was also missing: https://imgur.com/a/dANLrlQ</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have no notebook icon in the search box. I simply have the home icon and the settings icon far below it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched many other forums and have attempted to resolve this using SFC (nothing found), DISM image repair (nothing found), added BingSearchEnabled to the correct registry path with the correct hexadecimal, and ran windows update to confirm that I
 was completely up-to-date. I am at a loss here if anyone has suggestions or a similar issue. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            You might want to run a repair upgrade.
<br />This will not wipe data or apps but it is always a good idea to do a backup of your data just in case.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do this.

            I will not be performing this step. I have done this many times previously and it breaks many aspects of my machine; for example, the machine is considered a new PC such that every application that associates with my previous installation of Windows will
 no longer be able to connect to the "old" PC as it was repaired.&nbsp;

            Repair and\or Reset are the only options from here.
<br />You have done all the other troubleshooting corrupt o\s files issues.
<br />Even checking on a new account, which definitely means an o\s issue.
<br />if you want to just use your computer without cortana and hope an update will fix it you can try that for a few weeks.

            If the OS was corrupt, DISM or SFC would have caught something. I need resolution steps besides repair or reset when I know the OS is operating as it should be. Someone post a registry screenshot of Cortana so I can see if anything is missing.&nbsp;

<p>More information to supplement this discussion:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I may have disabled Cortana a long time ago for privacy reasons. I never make any irreversible changes to my PC so I assumed it was a registry tweak or a GP edit. I have checked both and Cortana is good to go in GP. The registry shows a missing key (as

            That is not true. DISM or SFC does not always fix o\s issues.
<br />Just look at previous forums where only a reset or repair worked.
<br />Try this... right click your start button and click powershell (admin)
<br />Type the following.
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />See if that works.

<h2>            Hardware ID missing</h2>
                    <p>Problem:<span>&nbsp; </span>Lenovo ThinkCentre <span>M93p</span> (running Windows 7), won’t recognize HP LaserJet Enterprise M604P
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer installs OK (through USB port) and prints, but upon a restart (or shut down and new start), the PC displays the message “Hardware ID missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows cannot identify the device plugged into the Intel(R) USB 3.0 root hub”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing it using different ports and installing it 3 different ways yields the same result.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(1-installation disk; 2-installer downloaded from HP.com; and 3-plug and play using Windows 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support contacts with HP, Lenovo<span>&nbsp; </span>and Microsoft have not solved this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have the "Tower Desktop" version and you haven't tried connecting the printer to one of the USB 2.0 ports on the back of the computer (the ones with the black rather than blue insert), try that.</p>
<br />
<p>I can't tell from the available specs of the M604P whether it requires a USB 2.0 connection.&nbsp; I suggest that you get in touch with HP directly or post in the relevant HP support forum.</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Flickering Cursor When Typing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flickering Cursor When Typing</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I'm having the most annoying problem with my computer--whenever I go to type something, the cursor flickers constantly. Every time I press a key, the cursor disappears for a fraction of a second, then reappears before the next keypress and is incredibly
 distracting. I tried changing the hide cursor while typing setting in Control Panel, but it had no effect. Applications which manage the cursor themselves (such as Microsoft Word) don't suffer from this problem, but it occurs with just about every other text
 field on my computer.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever seen something like this before? I wasn't able to find any similar issues. Oddly enough, it happened on my old machine as well, but that was running XP.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>Is your Mouse a PS2 or USB one?
</span></p>
<p><span>You can try these steps and check if it helps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Remove and then reinstall the mouse drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If it is a PS2 Mouse try this:
</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span><span>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, locate the Mouse to uninstall/delete and then right-click the device name and uninstall/delete it.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now restart the system
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>And let Windows discover the device and install it automatically.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>If it is a USB Mouse then:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try plugging it in a Different port and check. If the problem persists then follow this
 step: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the first step from above to open Device Manager. In Device Manager, locate the
</span></span><span>USB Controllers - Right Click - UNINSTALL everything in the Category one at time EXCEPT the Category itself – REBOOT</span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>This will refresh the USB driver stack.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2: We can try to update the Mouse Drivers to the most recent and check if it
 works.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Reduce the hardware acceleration for display drivers and check if it works.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Reducing the hardware acceleration system wide
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can turn off hardware acceleration completely or turn it down system wide in the following manner:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<strong>Start &gt; Control Panel</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the classic view, double click on the
<strong>Display</strong> icon. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the
<strong>Settings</strong> tab and click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> button. The Advanced Settings dialog box appears.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the Troubleshoot tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can turn down the hardware acceleration by selecting an intermediate value.</span></p>

            A lot depends on which brouser you are using. In Google and Firefox you can tell the brouser to open each new search site in a new tab. See<em> tools</em> in top (where file, edit, view etc appear)&gt;options&gt;tabs&gt; then select (check) always open in a new
 tab. to close a tab (website) look for the 'x' in the right of the tab, click it and it should close a single website w/o closing the entire brouser. good luck.

<br />
Under the circumstances you seem to be describing (single tab), there <br />
are two ways to "exit" a web site:<br />
<br />
1) Navigate to a _different_ web site.<br />
<br />
2) Close IE.<br />
<br />
You could also set IE to navigate to a local address on your computer, <br />
but that wouldn't be connected to the Internet.<br />
<br />
What is, *exactly*, that you're trying to accomplish? With more, <br />
clearer information, perhaps someone can offer you a solution that meets <br />
your needs.<br />
