    <title>Game stop working after an Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game stop working after an Update</h2>
                    So I stopped playing a game as I found one like it in certain ways. However I recently started playing it and after an update I start it up and few minutes in it stops working (Heroesand generals.exe stopped working) and 3 seconds later it only gives me
 the option of closing it. I don't know if it is game issue, steam issue (the platform) or windows issue. I tried&nbsp;another game and also stopped working (launcher) about a minute in.&nbsp;I can play other games no problem (one exception disconnects due to crappy
 wifi) and even if it stops responding it does not give me the .exe has stop working. So is there a way to check what is wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Octavio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this issue happened after installing the latest update, you may need to install the latest drivers for your computer. Most of the Graphic card manufacturer are now releasing the updated driver for Windows 10 Anniversary update to optimize its stability.<br />
<br />
We suggest you to install the latest driver for your Graphic card from your PC manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
If installing the latest driver still does not resolve the issue, we may need to ask for the Event Viewer log of your system to check the possible cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.</p>

    <title>my skype account has been hacked and skype support will do nothing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulcowan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            my skype account has been hacked and skype support will do nothing</h2>
                    <p>My skype account has been hacked twice in 6 weeks and skype support could care less.<br />
<br />
Last time it was hacked, they withdrew money but here we are again 6 weeks later with the same problem<br />
<br />
The hackers used a @tempr.email domain which just looks fake but hey ho.&nbsp; They can access it , I cannot.</p>
<p><br />
They have no problem accessing my account.<br />
<br />
I cannot log in or get a verification code sent to the correct phone because<br />
</p>
<p>I have filled in the recovery form 3 times, have spent an hour on skype support with 3 different people and their advice was to setup a new account.<br />
<br />
It asks me for information that I would need to log into skype to know.<br />
<br />
It wants to know when the last time I paid for skype.&nbsp; I did pay for skype about 5 years ago.&nbsp; My online bank won't go that far back.<br />
<br />
I will never, ever use skype again but I want this account deleted.&nbsp; Skype is clearly insecure.<br />
<br />
But they will not help me.&nbsp; They are quite happy for the hackers who changed the name to
p***.c****@******.email to use it but will not help me in any shape or form.<br />
<br />
It is disgusting.<br />
</p>
<p>The agent was called Exodus B allegedly and the support number is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">1453528780</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">The advice was to create a new skype account so I can keep using it.<br />
<br />
I never ever want to use it again.&nbsp; It is insecure but that is the advice.&nbsp; Hackers keep hacking and the real users can get stuffed.<br />
<br />
Disgusting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><br />
I don't believe there is anything I can do but just accept it.<br />
<br />
HOw is tempr.email even allowed?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your concern. I understand how upsetting it is for you to not be able to access your Skype account. Based on what you have mentioned you have done so far, you have done what is supposed to resolve the issue and we greatly appreciate
 your time and effort in doing so. In your case, the best recourse I would strongly recommend you to do would be to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I
 suggest that you create a new account instead.</p>

<p>Disgusting answer from a disgusting support staff.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you had actually read my post which you clearly did not, I wrote the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The advice was to create a new skype account so I can keep using it.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I never ever want to use it again.&nbsp; It is insecure but that is the advice.&nbsp; Hackers keep hacking and the real users can get stuffed.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disgusting.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I don't believe there is anything I can do but just accept it.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOw is tempr.email even allowed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you gave me the same advice that I don't want.&nbsp; I would rather die than open another insecure skype account.&nbsp; I will never use skype again.<br />
<br />
I want it deleted but I cannot recover the account.<br />
<br />
HOw on earth can somebody with an email address of <strong>tempr.email </strong>be allowed to take over someone's account while I cannot recover the account because it is asking for information for something I have not used in a long time.<br />
<br />
It is easier for hackers to use it than me and support do nothing.<br />
<br />
I look at offshore code a lot and these people are incapable of even simple tasks and your support has all the hallmarks of offshore support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are incapable of doing anything.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The email address was changed to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** a month ago.</p>
<p>I then deleted this email but the hackers got back in.</p>
<p>I cannot recover my account, it is asking me for skype information that happened years ago.<br />
<br />
Like 2 skype numbers I have called.&nbsp; I have no idea because it is so long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wants to know a skype payment.&nbsp; The last time I bought skype credit was years ago.<br />
<br />
I cannot remember the dates and my online banking search is within the last 6 months.</p>
<p><br />
You have abandoned my account to the hackers and will do nothing apart from advice me over and over again to open a new account.<br />
<br />
I do not want to ever use skype again and I want my account deleted.<br />
<br />
Such an obvious hackers email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but you allow that.<br />

<br />3. Check with Gigabyte Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below).
<br />
<br />BiosVersion = F2
<br />BiosReleaseDate = 11/25/2014
<br />SystemManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.
<br />SystemProductName = GA-78LMT-USB3 6.0
<br />BaseBoardManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.
<br />BaseBoardProduct = GA-78LMT-USB3 6.0
<br />BaseBoardVersion = SEx

<br />
<br />4. Use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />5. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).
<br />
<br />========================
<br />
<br />Run checkdisk (chkdsk /f /r )
<br />
<br />FIle Explorer - Right Click the drive -  Properties - Tools  - Error checking - 
<br />Check - scan the drive 
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />From the Command Prompt of the Windows 10 disk (boot from it) :
<br />
<br />chkdsk /f /r
<br />(Space after k and before /  and after f and before / )
<br />
<br />REBOOT
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />(Space after c and before / )
<br />
<br />REBOOT
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />This is my generic how to for proper driver updates : 
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -  write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device  Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's  site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -  check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier.

            As a side note, sometimes reinstalling Nvidia's latest driver helps.
<br />Completely remove everything from Nvidia using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.

<br />You can head either to Nvidia or the manufacturer of your device to get the newest driver.

<p>Service Pack 2 supports WPA.&nbsp; You might have to install an updated driver program, with WPA support, for the computer's wireless adapter.</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer supports Windows XP with Service Pack 2.&nbsp; To get new security updates, install Service Pack 3.</p>

    <title>Cannot open multiple files into photoshop from explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbusch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open multiple files into photoshop from explorer</h2>
                    <p>I shoot sports photography and my workflow is to open over 100 jpgs at a time to quickly edit and crop.&nbsp; I have done this for years successfully with all versions of PS and Windows.&nbsp; After upgrading from windows 7 64 to windows 10 64, I can select up to&nbsp;28
 jpgs from the photoshop browser then right-click and open/open-with and photoshop opens and they all load.&nbsp; Selecting more than 28 images and then right-click and open/open-with results in no files being loaded (nothing happens at all).&nbsp; These are all jpgs
 and I have 12gig of ram.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to highlight more than one image in windows explorer and then right click and open/open-with, it opens photoshop but loads only the first image highlighted.&nbsp; I have photoshop as the default program for images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is a registry setting I can adjust to increase the number of files that can be opened at once?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are having with your DVD drive is somehow related to issues on compatibility. To isolate the issue, we would like you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried installing the updates for your drive? </li><li>Can you see the drive in Device Manager? </li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by going to Control Panel&gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Configure a device. The Hardware Troubleshooter will open. You can set it to fix the detected problems automatically or select
 and opt to fix only the one‚Äôs you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>

            I'm having the same problem. Toshiba&nbsp;dvd player doesn't work anymore after the updates. I followed this instruction but there's no "configure device". Also, my computer has gone really slow. This is really frustrating. Oftentimes, updates just stuff up
 my computer.&nbsp;

<p>The above doesn't work as the internal dvd player is not recognized as a device so does not show up. &nbsp;DVD player worked fine prior to the Windows 10 update. &nbsp;Very frustrating!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Do you remember making any changes to the system?</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the methods mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below to allow remote connection to the computers you want to connect.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open System by clicking the &nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button,
 right-clicking&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Computer</strong></span></span><span><span> and then clicking &nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Properties</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click &nbsp;<span><strong>Remote settings</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the<span><strong>System Properties</strong></span> dialog box, under &nbsp;<span><strong>Remote Desktop</strong></span>,
 select one of the three options and then click &nbsp;<span><strong>Select Users</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If you are an administrator on the computer, your current user account will automatically be added to the list of
 remote users and you can skip the next two steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the&nbsp;<span><strong>Remote Desktop Users</strong></span> dialog box, click&nbsp;<span><strong>Add</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the&nbsp;<span><strong>Select Users or Groups</strong></span> dialog box, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To specify the search location, click&nbsp;<span><strong>Locations</strong></span> and then select the location you want
 to search.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In &nbsp;<span><strong>Enter the object names to select</strong></span>, type the name of the user that you want to
 add and then click&nbsp;<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The name will be displayed in the list of users in the Remote Desktop Users dialog box.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Change the remote settings and check it that resolves your issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open Remote Desktop Connection by clicking the</span></span><span><span><strong>&nbsp; Start</strong></span></span><span><span>button.
 In the search box, type&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong></span></span><span><span> and then, in the list of results, click &nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In&nbsp;<span><strong>Computer</strong></span>, type the name of the computer you want to connect to.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Before connecting, click&nbsp;<span><strong>Options</strong></span> and then make the changes you want on the &nbsp;<span><strong>Display</strong></span>,<span><strong>Local
 Resources</strong></span>, &nbsp;<span><strong>Programs</strong></span>,<span><strong>Experience</strong></span> and<span><strong>&nbsp; Advanced</strong></span> tabs.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have various <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</strong></span> bug checks.<br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</em><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.<br />
<br />
By default, the fault of the crashes is NETIO.sys which is the Network I/O Subsystem. This is not the true cause of the crash, and usually when we have network related crashes like this, it's caused by one of two things:<br />
<br />
1. Network drivers themselves need to be updated.<br />
<br />
2. 3rd party antivirus or firewall software causing NETBIOS conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">--------------</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Uninstall Gigabyte Easy Saver - mobo power utility driver ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>We have as lot of symbol errors, therefore we cannot do much debugging. With this said, if you still crash after #1, enable Kernel-Dump files and Driver Verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540128%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540128%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />

<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
„Éª&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<h3> wmtangk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail - message sent from Yahoo account saved in &#34;sent items&#34; folder, not &#34;Sent&#34; folder as Yahoo webmail</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10, added my Yahoo account in the Mail app.&nbsp; However, after I send an email, the message goes to the "Sent Items" folder (a new folder created by Mail), but not the Yahoo default "Sent" folder.&nbsp; It means that, when I use iPhone Mail and Yahoo
 webmail to send messages, all go to "Sent".&nbsp; If I use Windows 10 Mail to send, it goes to "Sent Items".&nbsp; I thus need to refer to 2&nbsp;folders to look up all my sent message - if I am to search for a message, I have to look at 2 places.&nbsp; Such problem didn't happen
 in Windows 8.1 Mail.&nbsp; Please advise how I can direct all my sent message from WIndows 10 Mail back to "Sent" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, same thing happen to "Trash".&nbsp; Windows 10 Mail created a "Deleted Items" folder for deleted mails using this app, while my Yahoo webmail move them to "Trash".&nbsp; ~rolleyes~</p>

            <p>Different apps, different structures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does 'Sent Items' show up as well in your Webmail? </p>
<p>My Webmail also shows 'Sent' and 'Trash' but not 'Sent Items' and not 'Deleted' nor do 'Sent' and 'Trash' show up in Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Sent' on&nbsp;my mail server has only a few messages which I suspect are from my short&nbsp;spend with&nbsp;Win8 and it's Mail app.</p>
<p>On Win8 I used IMAP and I think that 'Sent' may be part of that protocol. I don't remember to have ever used Webmail to sent email so they must be due to Win8 Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 10 I'm back&nbsp;to POP. <del>I haven't yet tried to sync my 'Sent Items' folder. I'm a little hesitant to try and do that.</del></p>
<p><del>On the other hand when I rightclick it&nbsp;it offers to&nbsp;stop syncing, so: huh?</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>As to 'Trash'/'Deleted Items', messages I delete in Mail will go to Deleted Items&nbsp;and once 'Deleted Items'&nbsp;is synced they&nbsp; also disappear&nbsp;from the server. So I suspect that they are just a temporary place holder rather than a real folder. Depending on what
 app you use they function as a filter of what you will see in your inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I accidentally pushed sync once while I was still on the Sent Items folder but that did not copy them back onto the server, nor did the ones on the server pop up in Sent Items.</p>

            Thanks for the sharing. &nbsp;In webmail, both 'Sent Items' and 'Deleted Items' folders created by Mail app appear. &nbsp;But the issue remains that my mails sent via Mail app and Webmail (&amp; Phone) appear in different folders and it is not as user friendly.

            <p>Right, so IMAP likely creates a mirror image between server and email application.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can just move the sent emails from the less dominant email client to the one of the main email client?</p>
<p>Not the most elegant solution but maybe friendlier/workable? </p>
<p>I believe Mail will search all folders so that shouldn't be a problem on that end.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I just had a look at my Windows Login Outlook account and 'Sent Items' actually shows up as 'Sent' under More</p>
<p>and deleted items are shown as 'Trash'. So the capability is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more interesting part (for me then)&nbsp;is that though it partly resembles the Outlook.com/Live.com/Hotmail.com webmail&nbsp;it says 'Trash' in the&nbsp;Mail app but 'Deleted' in the Webmail. So even the Webmail is showing an alias for the actual folder.</p>

            well, guess moving emails in "Sent Items" to "sent" manually is the only way to resolve this.&nbsp; But it's hard to understand how come this issue only happen in Windows 10 but not Window 8.1... real silly!

            <p>Completely different app, probably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say probably because I have no idea what Mail Application I used in Win8. IIRC I was offered a choice of what I wanted to use out of (I think) 3 choices and that then disappeared after the choice was made, a one time only setup of mail.</p>

            <p>Same problem here. Outlook 2013 and Windows 10 Mail app use different folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is bad behavior to silently create new imap folders on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app should not mess around with my imap folders but instead allow me to select from the ones that are already on the server. So that I can choose "this is the trash folder" and "that is the sent folder".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most ridiculous thing is that even Microsoft's own programs (outlook vs modern app) are completely inconsistent regarding imap folders.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not give me the option to eject external hard drives</h2>
                    In windows 10 every time I plug in one of my external hard drives to my surface pro 3 I always have to pull it out without ejecting it because it never gives me the option. It doesn't come up when right clicking the hard drive and it's faded out in file
 explorer. I know this presents a danger to the files on my external. Does any one have any way to help? I don't want to lose the files on this drive.

<p>If your tabs include the others but they are missing the Policies tab, look at bottom left of the pop-up and click on Change Settings. The policies tab will then appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for others, to get to this particular Properties pop-up window, you need to right-click over your portable hard drive name in file manager, select Properties. Then select the Hardware tab. Find the name of your portable hard drive in the Hardware list,

Further clarification, at least in my case, after choosing the drive and clicking on Properties, I had to click on Make Changes (marked with the shield icon) before Policies appeared.

    <title>Windows 7 Infinite Restart Loop &#40;Win 10 related&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Infinite Restart Loop &#40;Win 10 related&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, for a while windows kept giving popups recommending I update to Windows 10 from windows 7 on my pc. I've got experience with windows 10 on my laptop and I do - not - like - it. At all. I really just can't stand any aspect of that version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually however, automatic update I guess, decided to just avoid asking and download and start the installation of Windows 10. I vehemently didn't want this and saw no other recourse to prevent it but to the issue except by turning off my pc to stop the
 process and then letting my pc fix itself by undoing the changes windows 10 started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was about a month ago, well, three weeks ago maybe. There weren't any issues at all until three days ago (the first). It seems to think now, that it needs to restart to update my pc, every single time it boots up it seems to think this. I keep getting
 popups requesting that I reboot too, and if I ignore them long enough the reboot process starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the updates and such for windows 10 that I could see. I deleted some updates apparently directly related to windows 10 that were still in my updates list, but I'm still getting this issue. I've turned off automatic update and changed
 it to search for updates but ask to download and install, but unfortunately automatic windows still seems to think that I still have something that needs to install, ignoring my change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I have an install cd for windows 7 (though I believe I have my registry key on the pack of the PC, go figure, it's Dell), and frankly I'd rather not reinstall windows if it can be avoided as I'd loathe losing all my files and reinstalling everything.
 I was considering a program called Shutdownguard which I heard about on a site, which is supposed to help prevent issues exactly like this, but if there's a method to fixing my issue without that and without reinstalling Windows I thought it would be prudent
 to ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have Windows 7 x64, if it makes any difference at all, and thanks for your time and assistance. Any help at all is appreciated, as are attempts at help.</p>

            <p>If Win10 install process actually got started before you pulled the plug, it is likely you will need to re-install Windows 7.&nbsp; Following are instructions on how to do the re-install followed by instructions on how to prevent Win10 from threatening again:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em> </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer‚Äôs drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard‚Äôs advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit versions) KB3083710, &nbsp;KB3102810,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and&nbsp;KB3138612&nbsp;in advance, and store on a USB stick,&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; When you search for the&nbsp; 64 bit versions of these KB‚Äôs specify 64 bit.&nbsp; The 32 bit versions do not say which version they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3138612 and restart</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a
 precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.</p>
<p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of ‚Äúimportant‚Äù updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting ‚Äî NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn‚Äôt be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>

<p>I am issuing problems with my xbox one that I was not experiencing before. My xbox one has been connect to my internet with a wired connection since about the time I bought it (about a year). Randomly it has been having problems connecting to xbox live on
 my wired connection. It will connect to the internet and to xbox live, but randomly cut out. This happens normally about every 3-5 minutes. I have another xbox one that is wirelessly connected&nbsp; that works. I connected it to the internet cord the other xbox
 was on, and it would do the same. Here are things I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarted the xobx and router </li><li>Reset router and xbox to factory settings </li><li>Set up private connection (ip address) for the xbox </li><li>Made sure my firewall doesn't interfere </li><li>Tested multiple Ethernet cables </li><li>Tried a different router </li><li>Deleted and downloaded my gamer tag and data </li></ul>
<p>I can use any of my Ethernet cables on my computers or my PS4 and have no issues, but they won't work with my xbox. They work fine on my wireless connection but I want to know why they won't work on a wired connection. I did everything the xbox trouble shoot
 wanted me to do and than some but nothing is working. Can someone please help me.</p>

            <p>My Xbox ONE has been frozen and I've even had it independently checked out hardware wise. These guys can build an Xbox one from the ground up. I had them check even the diodes,&nbsp; internal connections like cables proper soldering and individual parts which all came back looking as if brand new. They were amazed how clean the inside was and still is. So, no dust. Also, I've been taking polls and doing interviews and it appears this is common with about 10-15 % of all consoles Microsoft has ever sold. This number of software only issues happens every mandatory update to 10% of all consoles just past a year owned which means the warranty is no longer valid via Microsoft. Wish I would have bought mine at Game-stop and could have just swapped out my unusable XBOX ONE. I have tried all the zip drive downloads Microsoft offers and just keep getting new error codes. Theoretically, Microsoft should be able to reset my console back to brand new software wise via my console is online and they always ha

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to download my copy of AOM: Gold onto my laptop however, I've discovered that while I have CD 1 and the product key, I don't have CD 2 and thus cannot complete the install. I've looked quite thoroughly through the microsoft sites trying to find
 the correct trial version to download then use my product key to unlock the full version but no success as of yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any links to the trial download of AOM: Gold Edition that I can use my product key on?</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, you have that option or you can create your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>
