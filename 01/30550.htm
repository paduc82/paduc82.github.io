    <title>suddenly all calls to Europe can&#39;t be connected as dialed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            suddenly all calls to Europe can&#39;t be connected as dialed</h2>
                    <p>I used to call my friends in Germany, France and the UK from my mobile phone using the Skype to go mobile number. Normally it would work when I entered the 49 for Germany and then the landline phone number of my friends without the "0" and pushed the "#".
 The automated response would be: "putting you through" - and I would here the phone of my friends ring and could talk to them.</p>
<p>For two weeks now, after the announcement: "putting you through" I might hear one to three rings and then the announcement: "can't connect to the number as dialed".</p>
<p>This happens all the time, no matter who I call in Germany or UK. When I call them from my landline, it works just fine.</p>
<p>I listened to the automated Skype advise to make international, which gives the example for dialing the UK by 0044, but if I do that it tells me that this is an invalid number. It seems that the geniuses at Microsoft don't even remember how they had set
 up there system. But now it looks like their system is no longer working. And by the way - yes I have plenty credit in my account and it used to work just fine.</p>
<p>So please, if anybody had the same problem and found the solution, let me know. Unfortunately Microsoft has itself walled of from public and doesn't believe in customer service reachability.</p>

<p>Dear Aleksei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got your message, but it didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>I am planning my next Europe vacation and want to call hotels and other companies, but none of the calls went through. I don't think that I need to create a Skype speed dial number for every hotel or car rental, I want to call.</p>
<p>Do I have to drop Skype, because the mighty Microsoft can't fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            The answer to the original question is:<br />
<br />
You don't.<br />
<br />
If you are using/relying on the built in NT Backup to backup your system, that is primitive technology (obviously - since it wants a floppy).&nbsp; If you have a disaster (even a minor one), you are going to have a big problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you want to make a backup, it makes sense to use modern technology - and it is not built in to XP.<br />
<br />
There are lots of popular options for third party XP backup and imaging software(s).<br />
<br />
A popular one folks seem to like is from <a href="http://www.acronis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acronis</a>.<br />
<br />
With that (free 30 day trial) you backup, make a bootable CD or bootable USB (that's modern, huh?) and use that in the event of a disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
They used to have a totally free version - maybe not anymore - just the trial, then you have to buy it, but it is well respected.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It is so much more robust than the XP backup, it is laughable.<br />
<br />
Many other options if you do a little Googling...<br />
<br />
Here are some products that LemP suggested might be appealing:<br />
<br />
Macrium Reflect<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery<br />
DriveImageXML<br />

    <title>Unable to download&#47;install new drivers and broken&#47;crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew_r.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download&#47;install new drivers and broken&#47;crashing apps on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp; As the title implies, I have been unable to download any new device drivers onto my Windows 10 laptop as well as having some of my apps crashing instantly or have missing info for almost two months now. &nbsp;The current devices affected are my Nvidia graphics
 card, Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, printers, and my Xbox 360 controller. &nbsp;My USB/SD memory drives/cards still seem to work along with my wireless keyboard and mouse, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I plug in the affected devices into my computer, the Device Manager has a warning on them and states their status as "this device is not configured correctly. (Code 1) &nbsp;To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver." &nbsp;However, whenever I try
 to update/download the drivers for the mouse (I have a wired mouse that no longer will work for whatever reason; it was working fine before and other people can use it perfectly fine), printers, or my controller, it takes anywhere between 5-10 minutes to check
 and "install" the drivers only to fail and say "Windows encountered a problem installing the drivers for your device" and that "the data is invalid." &nbsp;Uninstalling the driver and plugging the device back in to reinstall does not work. &nbsp;It also states the device
 as an "other device" with an "unknown" manufacturer for whatever reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As for broken or crashing apps, a few of my apps will no longer work anymore. &nbsp;Specifically, the FaceBook and Xbox apps no longer work and will either crash upon launch or within a couple of minutes. &nbsp;Uninstalling and reinstalling or resetting their data
 does not fix them. &nbsp;For broken apps, this is specifically affecting my Settings app. &nbsp;When I try to select certain options--Device-&gt; Mouse, Personalization, Accounts, and the options under Update and security-&gt; Recovery--the Settings app crashes. &nbsp;I do not
 know how to fix the Settings app at all. &nbsp;My Microsoft Office 2010 no longer work either, but I do not know when or why this happened. &nbsp;Repairing it did not work, and I no longer have the Key for it (it was either mistakenly thrown away or misplaced).</p>
<p>&nbsp; Besides trying to uninstall/reinstall some of the drivers and apps, I have not tried anything else. &nbsp;I tried to go back to an earlier Windows build after a major update, but the update was not far back enough (it only had the option for a Flash update
 at the time, which was about a few weeks ago). &nbsp;I could not do any of the advanced recovery options, aside from a Clean Install, do to my Settings app crashing when selecting the boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Here's a screenshot to show the broken/missing portions for this Settings section:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d8d7f9-0b27-4034-9abf-ced0dacb6f90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d8d7f9-0b27-4034-9abf-ced0dacb6f90" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although most of my computer still runs fine, the driver issues and broken Settings app seems to be of concern. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;If it is possible, I would prefer to not have to reinstall--or rather clean install--Windows 10 since I have
 a bunch of things I would rather not have to redownload with my slow internet. &nbsp;However, I will do it if all else fails.</p>

<p>Thanks Jomel Ber for giving me time and some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is that I am using :</p>
<p>Screen Recorder function of the PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to record other application with this function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen Recorder: Function</p>
<p>-screen capturing with voice .</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the voice function is making the problem here.</p>
<p>As it goes down and automatically up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GAME MODE works quite fine with screen capturing+video&nbsp; just with multiple screen capturing problem. If the screen has ToolTip and small window for help it does not show.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Regile Reb.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking this information with possibility.</p>
<p>Points:</p>
<p>-Game Mode is one that allows screen recording. Window icon +G</p>
<p>So, as per that - voice and video fine.</p>
<p>But, - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Problem with like tooltip and multiple window to work with.</p>
<p>Like: I move my mouse pointer on some icon that shows me information(tooltip) ,it will not available in video after recorded.</p>
<p>While recording I can perform all tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerPoint and Programming app:</p>
<p>-Power point :&nbsp; Yellow Color portion.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af555013-0162-4d2f-90c3-87647717fc4a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af555013-0162-4d2f-90c3-87647717fc4a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Tried this. Even side of this audio has same problem. Voice goes fine for few time then goes down then quite high after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works fine with multiple windows even tooltip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any APP.</p>
<p>-Programming app: Any app I use , same problem with voice here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Video Recording:</p>
<p>-I can not show you video recording as there is no upload option for video.</p>

<h2>            toshiba laptop. windows 10. speakers clicking. headphones work properly.</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba c50d laptop running windows 10. The realtek high definition audio is not working correctly. I can only hear a clicking sound. Troubleshooter cannot find any problems. I have uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled. Is there a fix for this?

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps below and check if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>1) Go to Device Manager and find the Realtek High Definition etc in the device list.&nbsp; I'm sure you've been here a few times already.</p>
<p>2) Then right click and choose Update Driver Software.</p>
<p>3) Then click Browse my computer...</p>
<p>4) Then choose let me pick.</p>
<p>5) You'll&nbsp;get&nbsp;2 or three options.</p>
<p>6) Choose the generic High Definition Audio.&nbsp; Let it install those drivers.&nbsp; Then reboot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Bluray HDCP issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jezza69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluray HDCP issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, posting on here in the hope that someone else has experienced the error code 0x01d7000a...</p>

<p>Excitedly went to watch the Hobbit on Blu-ray and the player starts but then gives me an error message that my monitor is not HDCP compatible. Swap Xbox out on same cables and it works fine on a normal Blu-ray player so I can rule out everything else in
 the chain apart from my Xbox One. I have a multitude of other devices connected including a PS3 which plays back Blu-ray perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I notice that the display drops out and re-syncs when the Blu-ray software starts up which may have something to do with the HDCP error.</p>
<p>Setup as follows:</p>
<p>Xbox &gt; AV Receiver &gt; TV all on HDMI.</p>
<p>So I cannot play Blu-ray at the moment on my Xbox. I have gone through checking and unchecking all related options on the setup menu and they all bring the same result. Error code 0x01d7000a</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Nope, don't plan on using it either. Unless there is a specific hardware requirement that requires the supplied cable to allow HDCP, just looks like a typical freebie cable suitable for bin donation. All my HDMI cables are latest gen, high speed, 3d 1.4,
 Ethernet etc. </p>

<p>I would recommend using the xbox hdmi cable for the xbox to receiver first for troubleshooting. Try it and let me know what happens.

<p>I too had a problem with HDCP and think I figured out what the problem is. </p>
<p>Hopefully these steps will help people having Blu-Ray "Black Screen" Playback Issues or DVD Playback Error code 0x91d70001 and DO NOT have a capture card plugged into the console (Also reported to cause these errors, due to HDCP protection)</p>
<p>After lots of troubleshooting, uninstalling the Blu-Ray App, Power Cycling the console etc. I basically switched the HDMI cable to another HDMI port on my TV and BOOM! I haz movies.
</p>
<p>I then set about trying to get movies to work over HDMI Port 1 again. I factory reset my TV and plugged the Xbox back into HDMI Port 1 on my TV and it now works fine.
</p>
<p>It seems like there's some sort of HDCP bug with the Console, and it blocked that HDMI port? I'm not sure, but either way, this fixed my problem.</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>I've had my Xbox one since launch, and did not have an issue until recently. I have Dish network HD, all of a sudden SciFy watching gives me an HDCP error. At first I could change the channel back and be fine, lately that is not working. I found that I can
 pull the HDMI plug out and put it back in, then it works.</p>
<p>I have a samsung 3D Smart TV and a Samsung sound bar.</p>
<p>Connection: &nbsp;Dish receiver connected to sound bar with XBOX One HDMI Cable, standard HDMI going from sound bar to TV.</p>

    <title>Problem using SFC and replacing bad files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arizona willie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem using SFC and replacing bad files</h2>
                    <p>My desktop computer ( this machine ) has been giving me trouble because every time I tell it to &lt; shut down &gt; or &lt; restart &gt; it tells me " Operations are in progress do not turn over machine. It will be restarted ( shut down ) when operations are complete
 " or something to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In searching for solutions I found an article that told to use SFC/SCANNOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done that but the resulting file has two sections where it reports trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each section lists 3 items but does not identify which directory the problem file is in except in the last entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both sections are talking about " Task Scheduler.lnk " it appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro Tablet that is also running Windows 8.1 where I can &lt; presumably &gt; get good copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running SFC/scannow on the SP says it is all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure exactly what needs to be replaced and where it is after looking at the trouble file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm puzzled at the references to amd because I do not have an amd processor or anything else in this machine as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What needs to be replaced?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the sections that show the problem:</p>

            <p>I wanted to make a backup first and discovered m backup program was not working.</p>
<p>The animation showing it backup up data between drives was working but Resource Monitor showed me that no data was being written to the drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to remove the backup program and re-install it and then was able to make a fresh backup before I tried the DISM thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday though, I looked at the file it&nbsp; SFC said was bad and it was just a .lnk .</p>
<p>I went to the directory where it resides and clicked on it and it brought up the Task Scheduler just like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that it didn't show up in sfc/scannow anymore but many other things DID show up that didn't before.</p>
<p>Lot of entries about ignoring double owner etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although sfc/scannow said there were files that could not be repaired, when I got to the end of the .log file the last line said all registry entries had been repaired!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been running under Windows 8.1 all day with no visible problems.</p>
<p>Right now I'm in Windows 10 and still no problems related to the sfc/scannow in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>And Windows 8.1 has run fine all day and I've made new backups in case I have to try the DISM commands. But I think I'm going to be fine --- I hope.</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>
</p><p>update ... I just tried sfc/scannow in an elevated command prompt and it went to 2% and then said it couldn't perform the requested operation. !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programmers got some work to do. I wish they would organize the .log file so that broken things are itemized at the end and perhaps put in red.&nbsp; The way it is now works but not easy to understand ... especially for amateurs.</p>

            <p>Hi Arizona Willie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"My desktop computer ( this machine ) has been giving me trouble because every time I tell it to &lt; shut down &gt; or &lt; restart &gt; it tells me " Operations are in progress do not turn over machine. It will be restarted ( shut down ) when operations are complete
 " or something to that effect."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Do you allow the Operations to be completed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often, very often, when I Shut down the computer, it will often start to install waiting Windows Updates. The next time, I boot up the computer, I also see the message you are seeing and I follow its instructions and it updates the Windows Registry, then
 reboots the computer and finishes updating, before booting into the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you turned off the computer or reset the Computer, while it was booting up, try running System Restore, to go back in time and see if that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, use your Windows 8.1 DVD to repair the operating system. If the repair doesn't work, then reformat and reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say that easily, because My Documents Folder is in a separate partition, from the operating system. No rule stated that everything needs to be located on the operating system's partition.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Store Error 0x80070002 &#40;comprehensive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok first thing's first. I have tried reading through threads and threads regarding this error and also on other websites and have already tried various methods e.g. running troubleshooter, clearing registry, system restore, wsreset.exe, making sure Windows
 Firewall is on and likewise Windows Update is also on all the time, have also reset Windows Update through use of CMD as well and run through some Powershell commands etc as well but still I have this issue. Normally, I use System Restore when something like
 this happens, but this time round I'm not having any success :((</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically this is what my Start menu now looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75d8e626-99b5-4798-afc4-3d298ca2f355" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, the problem started a day or two ago when for some odd reason, I couldn't get PC settings to work. All I wanted to do was change the picture on my lock screen. Then I realised at the same time that Windows Store also wasn't loading. Then in actual
 fact, all the Metro apps weren't working. I'd click on it but then it'd go blank or black for 1-2secs then back to the Start menu.</p>
<p>Somehow I found a solution through various websites that got my PC settings back and also my Store. But not the other apps.</p>
<p>I tried the uninstalling/installing business, but then gives me this error:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a8c9533-c362-4a6b-be08-344778d8768d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Error 0x80070002</p>
<p>So I've googled this error and tried the above mentioned tactics to no avail. </p>
<p>When I've tried System Restore it keeps failing. I've also done the sfc.exe thing which comes up as some corrupt files but unable to fix all of them.</p>
<p>So please, where do I go from here???? Really not wanting to refresh or uninstall Windows 8. Seems way too extreme. Desktop works fine, just the metro apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really hope someone can help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have a Asus S200E. Runs Intel(R) HD 4000 Graphics and has Core i3 processor</p>

<p>Where was that?&nbsp; Did you try a dism command too?&nbsp; But no repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I suggest using ProcMon it allows you to correlate all the diagnostics.</p>

</p><p>FWIW what I do when scanning these logs is use Powershell's ISE for its Regular Expression Find.&nbsp; Then look for&nbsp; Err|Warn|Fail&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing that makes me think that the "corruption" may only be permissions problems (or perhaps corruption caused by permissions
 problems).&nbsp; So, if you have a more powerful Administrator account, you might want to try using it before trying any more dism commands.</p>

<p>I'm trying the DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth currently but this is not the first time and previously hasn't worked...</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.&#34; Error code given is &#34;0xc000021a&#34; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I tried to restart my Windows 10 PC and got the following error " Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you." Error code given is 0xc000021a</p>
<p>While trying to restart the PC attempts to do an automatic repair (and fails) which brings me to a screen with a "Restart" button and an "Advanced Options" button. The restart option fails again and I have tried almost all the options on the advanced options
 page like doing a system restore or booting into safe mode or going back to a previous build or even resetting the PC and all of them have failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This PC was upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 so I don't have any recovery media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I log back into Windows? Thanks in Advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that i<span>f you see “<strong>Getting a few things ready</strong>”
</span>for longer than usual it means the PC is loading all the files and folders that were saved on your PC before&nbsp;preparing&nbsp;for automatic repair. If you have saved data of higher volume, it will take time for PC to load all the files and folders onto your
 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance about this issue refer to the response by <strong>Andre Da Costa
</strong>in the post: "<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/unable-to-download-windows-10-stuck-at-getting-a/a2c81771-063a-4756-a8f8-79c2f9ba740d">Unable to download Windows

            <p>A couple questions for you:</p><p><br /></p><p>Have you verified that this is not a hardware issue? As in, does your Xbox One controller function correctly elsewhere, like on your Xbox One Console? </p><p><br /></p><p>If it's not a hardware issue, you might be well off reinstalling the drivers for your controller. Press the Win key and search for 'drivers'. You should be able to find the Xbox Controller drivers towards the bottom of the list.&nbsp;Uninstall those and then plug your controller back in for them to be reinstalled. See if that fixes your issue.</p><p><br /></p><p>If that doesn't work, it could be that the title you are playing has controller compatibility issues. I would recommend contacting the developer in that case.</p>

    <title>Error 80004005 by installation of Windows Vista sp2 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jik771971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 80004005 by installation of Windows Vista sp2 x64</h2>
                    I tried to install this update 4x. I read through&nbsp;an answer in this forum that&nbsp;is similar to my problem&nbsp;and tried the solution but it still wouldn't install.<br />
I noticed something this last time because I watched the whole installation process. As we all know the system&nbsp;can reboot several times&nbsp;during the installation. During the 3rd part of the installation, the user account screen pops up asking for the password.
 However, I didn't have time to type the password into it, because&nbsp;it jumps back to a screen saying that the computer is installing the updates. Then, when the updates for 3rd part are&nbsp;100%&nbsp;finished it says they can't be installed. Then&nbsp;the computer uninstalls
 them and puts the computer into it's preinstallation state.&nbsp;Is it possible,&nbsp; because I&nbsp;didn't have a chance to&nbsp;enter my password, that the computer refused to acknowledge me as the administrater during the last part of the installation. &nbsp;Therefore, possibly
 stopping the installation process from making the&nbsp;necessary changes&nbsp;and reverting it into the previous state. I'm probably grasping at straws here, because I&nbsp;never had a problem like this before. Does anyone know what I should do to rectify the problem?<br />
I'm not sure if this is important but I installed another update after the 3rd time. The update was installed properly and works. So I thought everything was ok and tried to install sp2 again. The same thing happened. Why can I install other updates, but not
 that particular one? Other than this installation problem, the computer is running pretty good. I haven't noticed any slowness&nbsp; or anything else for the past couple of weeks. I'm stumped.<br />
<br />
I have a (desktop) Packard Bell imedia x5705 Intel Core 2 Quad&nbsp; 4 x 1GB(RAM) 2,33 GHz&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
1000 Gigabit hard drive <br />
Windows Vista Home Premium&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system type 64 bit&nbsp;<br />
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT130<br />
<br />
This computer is connected to 2 other computers with a D-Link KVM Switch. One of the other computers has an Intel dual core Vista 32 bit&nbsp;system already running &nbsp;sp2 with no problem. They also share a router for broadband internet access.<br />
<br />
Should I try using the recovery disk again? I don't want to make things worse.

            Thank You Debbie - Support Engineer for all of your help.<br />
I went through all of the above mentioned steps in their proper order. However, they did not correct the problem.
<br />
I used the Packard Bell Recovery management options and restored my computer to&nbsp;it's original operating condition. Then I installed all of the necessary &nbsp;updates including sp2. I didn't activate the preinstalled antivirus software, or change any programs or
 settings &nbsp;until afterwards. The good thing about it is this. Packard Bell Recovery Management also creates a separate file for all personal files. So, when the computer&nbsp;was reset, I still had my personal files.<br />

<h2>            A error code.</h2>
                    I was trying to play some games when I got the error message. The code was "0x80073cf6". When I typed it tin xbox.com/errorhelp, like it told me, it said that the code didn't exist. I really need help. If anyone found a solution to this, please message
 back. Thanks.

here</a> in Xbox One Reddit, and that error code means that is some issue in your Console's HDD could be a software or hardware issue.<br />
Try first to uninstall and then install again those games. If doesnt work try to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Factory Reset </a>your console. If none of this works, looks like a hardware issue and you will need to repair it.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching for error code '0x80073cf6' to no avail. So there may be some other way, you can get an app from your xbox called 'xbox insider Hub' here you can report the error code. You can get more information here.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox

    <title>Roll back to Windows 7 after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikhilgolani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Roll back to Windows 7 after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell laptop with Windows 7 installed which is eligible for upgrade to Windows 10. I have also reserved the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is, if I do not like Windows 10 after sometime of the upgrade, can I go back to my original Windows 7 fusing the disc available which came with my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second question is whether all the applications that are currently installed will go away? Or they will be intact and work normally and I will not have to install them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third question is that I have 2 partitions of my hard disk, C drive and D drive. C drive has only windows and applications installed. D drive has all the other data, like documents, music, movies and pictures. What will happen to the drives? Will they also
 go away/merge into one or be intact and work normally the way they do now. Also will I lost my data in D drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate answers to my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance! :-)</p>

            Hey Nikhil,<br />
<p>1.</p>
<p><strong>You can go back to your previous version of Windows if you want to within 30 days of upgrading to Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>Revert back to previous version option would be present under settings, where there is an option to reset and refresh Windows.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings).</p>
<p><strong>However it is a good practice to backup most important data before the upgrade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>They will work as same as now.No data would be lost in D: Partition as windows is installed in C:/</p>
<p>hope it helps.do reply back for further queries,would be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            What happens when you try to make a call?
<br />Are you using Wireless or Wired network?
<br />
<br />Have you tried signing out then signing in again?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Skype
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, I suggest you install Skype Classic:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

    <title>Check disk stuck at Deleting index entry and does not complete the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Check disk stuck at Deleting index entry and does not complete the scan</h2>
                    <p>Original title: &lt;chkdsk will not complete&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a Win7/SP1 machine, fully up to date with Win Updates, in an elevated comand wiondow, a certain drive (on a Drobo) will get all the way through Chkdsk, indicates "no problems found", and displays the ending stats, and then just hangs, refusing to return
 to the command prompt. It will hang there for hours. When force the command window closed and&nbsp;re-run Chkdsk I get the following:</p>
<p>Deleting index entry Chkdsk20120630023339.log in index $I30 of file 17.<br />
</p>
<p>That is apparently caused by being forced to kill the command window.&nbsp; I have never found a reference to a chkdsk*.log file written to the drive, only to the Event Log.&nbsp; It does not appear on a search of the drive.</p>
<p>If I run Chkdsk from Tools in Explorer it does about the same thing, never completing.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Not sure if this is a chkdsk bug or an OS file system problem. That Drobo has 2 other volumes, one with about the same number of files. The other 2 volumes Chkdsk normally and I have no reason to suspect any issues with the
 Drobo.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run check disk from Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: To boot into Windows Recovery Environment, refer to the following link:<br />
What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a><br />
Note: Expand “To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer” in the above article.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: When at the system recovery options, select Command Prompt from the list of tools.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: While at the command prompt, type the following commands and press enter after each command.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>chkdsk /f/r<br />
</strong></p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>

<h2>            Downloading Sea of Thieves on PC</h2>
                    <p>I already have Sea of Thieves on Xbox from the Store and saw that I could also play on PC, as long as I used the Xbox account.</p>
<p>I have tried to install it with my account on PC through the store and it comes up with an error, 0x80070015. I try to refresh but the error persists.</p>
<p>Is there a way of getting around this problem?</p>

            It could be a factor. I always first recommend you download apps and games to the local C:\ drive first and if you need to free up space, you can move them to another drive or partition after.
