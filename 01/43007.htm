<h2>            Windows 7 . bad image logonui.exe</h2>
                    running Windows7 Home Premium 64. Getting bad image errors this morning from&nbsp; nowhere. logonui.exe, slui.exe and then userinit.exe. When it boots I get a black blank screen with a windows not genuine message. I put my genuine Windows disk in ...it tried
 a boot fix.....but no help. I have an image backup....but from january....dont want to go back that far...mainly as I would lose my Outlook email history. The hardware all seems ok...PC is dual boot and can still run Vista ok. Any sugestions?&nbsp; cant think of
 any recent software or hardware changes.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Try to recycle Explorer.exe by opening up task manager (You can use <strong>
Ctrl+Shift+Esc</strong>), selecting explorer.exe in the list and choosing End Process.</div>
<div>b. Now go to the <strong>File </strong>menu, choose <strong>New </strong>Task and type in explorer into the open box. Hit enter, and explorer should restart itself.<br />
<div>c. Check if the desktop is visible now.</div>
<div><br />
If you are able to find the desktop and <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>System Restore </strong>to an earlier point to which the computer worked fine.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div><br />
Perform <strong>System Restore </strong>to an earlier point before installing this application.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>System Restore</strong> can return your system files to a point in time before you noticed a problem, without affecting documents, photos, or other personal files. If System Restore doesn't fix the problem, you can undo the restore operation and choose
 another restore point.</div>

            Hi alisaker, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10.

    <title>network bridge - not sure if it does what I want it to do - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve richter  say:</h3>
<h2>            network bridge - not sure if it does what I want it to do</h2>
                    
<p>I have a PC with two network adapters. One to a small office lan which has a&nbsp;few PCs and Servers. The 2nd adapter connects to a network of&nbsp;IP cameras.&nbsp; I want to bridge the two networks so that a PC on the main&nbsp;small office LAN can connect to the IP cameras
 on the 2nd network. Problem is, when I&nbsp;"network bridge" the two networks together the PC with the&nbsp;2 adapters, the one where the network bridge is configured, loses its connection to the small office&nbsp;LAN, the one with the PCs and Servers.&nbsp; All it can see (
 using PING and the browser ) are the cameras. <br />
<br />
Am I using network bridge correctly? Why would the bridge not be working?&nbsp; From&nbsp;a small office lan PC, with IP address 192.168.1.10, connecting to router at 192.168.1.1, I want to be able to browse to an IP camera at 192.168.2.101 thru the PC with 2 network
 adapters, 192.168.1.12 and 192.168.2.100.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<div>You don't want to set it up as a bridge mode. You want it to function as a router. That way, the PC's know which network the 192.168.2.x hosts are on.

<p>I don't follow. In the context of what I have, 2 routers, one with PCs and Servers, the other with IP cameras, and 1 PC with two network adapters, connecting to each network, what can network bridge do for me?&nbsp; If it does not bridge the traffic from one
 network to another, what does it do?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing Consistently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bapacop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing Consistently</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday Windows booted fine. I made no changes to the system while the computer was powered on. Today, Windows won't boot. It gets to the blue flag logo but no spinning dots appears and it just sits there indefinitely. Sometimes it sits there and says
 "Preparing Automatic Repair" with the same results. If I try to get into the recovery options with Shift+F8 the boot hangs on my motherboard's boot screen. If I try to get into my UEFI settings, it hangs on a black screen with my cursor visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Got Automatic Repair to run, seemingly at random. It told me to restart, so I went to Advanced Options and made it run again. It failed. I tried to System Restore but all my restore points are gone. I tried to boot into Safe Mode but the computer hung
 on the Startup Settings screen. I had to forcibly power off and now I'm stuck on the blue logo with no dots again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT II: SrtTrail.txt lists the following Root cause:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action:<br />
Result : Failed. Error code = 0x32</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action: System files integrity check and repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x490</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT III: Automatic Repair finally worked again yesterday, allowing me to perform a system refresh. Windows then worked fine for several reboots, until it suddenly froze and forced me to hard shutdown. When I turned the computer back on, the boot process
 hung on the motherboard screen. A few reboot attempts and it suddenly booted to Windows just fine. This morning, I was back to seeing the flag with no dots and have since progressed to hanging on the motherboard screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT IV: Changed the subject and writing here to better reflect the current situation. Issue was initially resolved, somehow, by moving my video card to a different PCI-E slot. The issue resurfaced last month and escalated to the point of needing assistance
 last week. Shortly after I asked for assistance, the problem somehow morphed into a new problem: Windows freezes after ~20 minutes of activity. This freeze does not extend to Safe Mode or the recovery command prompt. A full reinstall of Windows has not resolved
 the issue. Both the power supply and RAM have been tested and have no issues.</p>

            I'd like to start this off by thanking everyone who was kind enough to offer their assistance. I've bookmarked several pages that were linked here and will be keeping them in mind whenever I next need to do troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
The short version of this story is that I am an idiot.<br />
<br />
Here's the longer version: The boot issue was being caused by a loose power cable. When I tested the power supply, this loose cable was inadvertently fixed when it was disconnected and reconnected for the test. This test also indirectly caused the freeze problem
 to begin. I have an H100i liquid CPU cooler. There are two fans on top of the liquid tank to bring air in and one beneath it to direct the air thse fans bring in towards the exit fan. This lower fan just so happens to block access to one of the motherboard's
 power connections, so I had to remove it to test the power supply. When the test was complete, I failed to check the airflow arrows on the fan and attached it upside-down. Instead of helping to bring the airflow through the liquid tank and direct it outside
 of the case, the fan was now fighting the airflow of the fans on top of the tank and the exit fan while directing all the warm air already in the computer back onto the liquid tank.<br />
<br />
In other words, the freezes were occurring because the computer was overheating.

 the operating system is corrupt and that I need to get another copy of windows and that I need a new hard drive now. I asked who will pay for this and she said I would have to pay for it all .&nbsp; I asked to speak to her manager and she forwarded me to a voice
 mail.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span>I'd start by clearing the system cache (it's just updates plus other temporary files, nothing that's at all important to anyone) by:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button on the controller, go right 2 clicks to Settings, pick System Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Storage (or Memory).</span></p>
<p><span>3) Move over any hard drive or memory unit (not the Cloud) &amp; press (Y) on your controller &amp; pick Clear System Cache.</span></p>
<p><span>4) When asked to confirm storage device maintenance, choose Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked... ports can be blocked in your router,
</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing a port blockage:</span></p>
<p><span>1) turn off the Xbox then</span></p>
<p><span>2) unplug the power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway'. If so, skip step 3).</span></p>
<p><span>3) unplug the power from the modem.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem (or gateway) power.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem (or gateway) which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router, then
 when that light says it's ready, skip step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</span></p>
<p><span>7) Turn on the Xbox. &nbsp;For more background on Ports, see

I've been appealing to the Microsoft Community to ask you to believe that if I can update my Safe Mode drivers. I mention that I went into the safe mode in computer mode last night in the device manager section and I have some yellow drivers. How can I fix it to make everything ok?
Thank you!
Wait for response!

            Hi Adrian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Safe Mode with Networking is what you'd want if you have any problems updating drivers or if you are in a state where WIndows cannot start otherwise.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If you have any problems all other methods are covered here to update drivers:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Adrian
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can't update drivers while in Safe Mode, its a diagnostics mode of Windows and only intended to troubleshoot issues. 
<br />
<br />You could download the drivers, but you would need to reboot into Normal Mode and install them there. 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Try grabbing the hardware id for the drivers that are missing in Device Manager then post them here so we can help you find the appropriate driver.

            Hi Adrian
<br />
<br />When you boot your PC into Safe Mode, some drivers like your video card driver are disabled, most likely that is why you have exclamation marks beside your drivers
<br />
<br />Windows does not allow drivers to be updated in Safe Mode as a security precaution,because drivers must be signed and verified before installation
<br />
<br />May I ask what trouble you are experiencing that is causing you to boot into Safe Mode?

<h2>            How to turn Title bar accent color off in regedit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, i solved my problem of having the thick windows borders, but there is another problem; When i try to turn it off in settings, it doesnt do anything: Even after a restart, i was wondering if there was a way to disable this through redegit or something.
 Thanks! </p>

            Hi Lost, try setting that to 1, then restart your PC and then toggle it back to 0. That is definitively the associated registry key for that setting. Toggling it may clear whatever bug is in Windows . . .

<h2>            USB Keyboard and Mouse no longer work on Windows 10 Login Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night my computer was functioning normally but this morning when I turned it on, it will boot to the Windows 10 login screen and the USB connected keyboard and mouse cease to function. I have tried a number of troubleshooting steps but nothing is appearing
 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)The keyboard and mouse function on the BIOS setup screen so I know the devices and ports are still functioning correctly</p>
<p>2)I've tried plugging in the peripherals to different ports, the LEDs will light up on the devices briefly but they still do not function.</p>
<p>3) I unplugged both devices, restarted the computer and plugged the devices in once I'm on the login screen to see if the drivers reinstall but no luck.</p>
<p>4)I am unable to open the device manager or enter safe mode without the use of these devices to login to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has a MSi b150M Mortar motherboard and an intel i5 CPU running Windows 10 Home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>well go back to start up options and RESET PC. I think you can save your settings and files etc. I am thinking this is your only option. I also think it must have been the new cumulative update that came out Tuesday that may have caused this.</p>

<p>The only other thing would possibly be that your USB controller for your USB ports on your motherboard went bad. Probably not, but I have seen it happen a few times on boards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also go into your BIOS and check the settings for them there. Probably a waste of time but check anyways.</p>

<p>You need to change you EFI boot settings to boot from the uSB to install windows or you will get issues like this.</p>

<p>Well if you have a DVD drive, I would always install windows from a DVD install disk rather than USB. So create one and try a DVD from the Windows10.ISO image file</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that windows thinks it&nbsp;is in the process of completing the update which it can not, is what I gather from the message you get or wants you to log in first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind of odd. And I mean, if you can not do anything to get mouse and keyboard to work, can not reset PC, restore PC or anything and even install from USB then try the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember you will lose all your personal data on C:\ if you do not back it up first before a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you may have to play with the boot start up settings too for EFI. Personally, I would junk the EFI and do a BIOS install. I have not seen anyone have any issues with a BIOS install of 10, as far as I have seen anyways.</p>

<h2>            LOCKED OUT after log in attempt using picture password</h2>
                    <p>For the longest time, I had logged in on my laptop using gestures on a picture password because I have long since forgotten my text password. Today, response was slow so I had several failed attempts. Now, its asking for the text password. Is there a chance
 I can revert this to the picture password log in? I tried the text password twice to no avail. Im afraid that if I continue I will be permanently locked out. A deadline is approaching and I need to access important files on my device. Pls help.</p>

            Hi Rick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It would be much easier to write down your password than to go through all that's involved with recovering Windows when you can't sign in.  Hopefully after all this you'll remember:
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />Try signing into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> 
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi <span><span>adames123</span>
</span>,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum site<br />
<br />
a) Is your ATI Radeon X1250 graphic card driver upto date?<br />
<br />
b) Is the issue with only one game?<br />
<br />
If yes then try reducing the graphic level and check if it still crashes.<br />
<br />
If not, try the steps given below<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1 :</strong> <br />
<br />
If not, I would suggest you update the latest graphics card drivers which are compatible with windows 7. Download the drivers from the manufacturers website and install the same on the computer.<br />
<br />
Refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong> <br />

<br />
<strong><br />
Update drivers: recommended links</strong> <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</a>
<br />
<strong><br />
Step 2:</strong> <br />
<br />
If you still continue to face the issue, Id suggest you to uninstall the game and re-install the same in administrator mode.<br />
<br />
To install the game in administrator mode, right click the installation file and select Run as administrator and proceed with the installation.<br />
<br />
You can refer to the link below which gives you all the information about Flight simulator X and also on how to fix the issue and let us know whether it helps you to fix the issue.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, then I would suggest that you post the issue in Microsoft Flight Simulator games Forum for further assistance.<br />

<h2>            Toolbar on a Windows 7</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Is there a way to move the taskbar in Windows 7 from the top to the bottom with hotkeys? A user was wiping off the keyboard with the computer logged in and hit a combination of keys that moved the taskbar. Through group policy the user is not allowed to modify
 or change&nbsp; the desktop using the right click mouse button&nbsp; so it can only be done through hotkeys. I have several users that have moved the taskbar now and I have no idea how to move it back .</p>

<p>Given that the computers are locked down with GPO, the proper way to move the Taskbar back would be to ask the administrator in charge of locking down the computers in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several methods that might work without needing to right-click the Taskbar to unlock it and permit moving, but I suspect that these methods would be locked out as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See <a href="https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1066-taskbar-move-location-desktop-screen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1066-taskbar-move-location-desktop-screen.html</a></p>
<p>Try "Option One" first.&nbsp; If that's locked out, "Option Three," which involves merging a *.reg file into the Windows Registry, will also likely to be forbidden by group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2877985/fix-locked-taskbar-moves-to-the-top-of-the-screen-in-windows-7-sp1-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2877985/fix-locked-taskbar-moves-to-the-top-of-the-screen-in-windows-7-sp1-or</a>&nbsp; It's not at all clear whether this "Hotfix" is intended to prevent the accidental moving of the Taskbar or if it will somehow permit
 you to move it back despite the group policy settings.&nbsp; You may or may not be permitted to apply a Hotfix to the locked down computers.</p>

<h2>            Printer Spooler Service stops after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade to Windows 10, I find that the Printer Spooler service is crashing at times with no warning. I am able to restart it through the Services manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the following errors in Events:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The print spooler failed to regenerate the printer driver information for driver Microsoft XPS Document Writer for environment Windows x64. Win32 system error code 1797 (0x705). This can occur after an operating system upgrade or
 because of data loss on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Installing printer driver Microsoft XPS Document Writer failed, error code 0x0, HRESULT 0x80070705. See the event user data for context information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know much about XPS, can I get away with removing it? If so, how would I do so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is related as well but my printer will no longer go to "deep sleep" mode after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>

Hi cristiang</p>
<p>The&nbsp;reality is that the MUI (Multilingual User Interface)&nbsp;language packs&nbsp;are the only files that are capable&nbsp;of changing&nbsp;the language in windows from one parent language to another parent language (Spanish to English).</p>
<p>These files can only be installed on Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise editions. Whether you are only going to&nbsp;install one language or all 35 languages&nbsp;does not change the requirements.</p>

<p>Dear Ronnie,</p>
<p>I just bought a Lenovo and somehow it must have been initialized by a previous owner then returned for&nbsp; some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was bought in Canada and therefore has two Default languages to install the Parent language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it's already been activated in French ... how do I revert back to English ... ( Win 7 Pro ).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are there two choices to install and then have NO choices to revert back to the one you want?</p>
<p>I may have to RESTORE the PC and get back to the start and PICK a language from there .... not very thrilled with MS for their inability to make available the change of Display languages... CASH grab if you ask me ... ( by asking users to Upgrade to higher
 version and charge some more )</p>
<p>Plain stupid ... yet they can get away with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Canada is unique because they have 2 Official languages. I'm sure that there is a rule there that any computer sold in that country must include the ability to select either of those 2 languages, when the computer is first purchased.</p>
<p>There are more examples of this around the world.&nbsp;Several Scandinavian countries have 3 or 4 official languages and computers sold in those countries must include the ability to select among those different languages/dialects.</p>
<p>When you bought that computer, the seller should have made the fact that it was activated in the French language, perfectly clear, prior to the purchase. Microsoft has no control over this.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            If you want to stay with Professional you will have to buy a copy of Windows in English.&nbsp; If you want English at the minimum price, use Anytime Upgrade to Ultimate and download the English MUI.&nbsp; If are not in position to spend any money on the project
 then stick with Spanish.&nbsp; Microsoft does not offer a free language change for Professional.

<div><br />
<div>I am in a similar position, I just bought a computer in Chile, it has Microsoft Windows 7 Starter, but the entire operating system is in Spanish.&nbsp;</div>
<div>How can I change this?
<div>Do I need Windows 7 Ultimate?</div>
<div>And if so how can I get this in South America, being you can only download it in certain countries?</div>
<div>Your assistance is much appreciated</div>

<p>Yes, you would need to have the Ultimate version to change display languages.</p>

                    <p>Lately every Skype call I try, or receive people cannot hear me and the call is dropped after several seconds. I did a quick uninstall and reinstall but it is still the same. If I try echo there is a few seconds of silence and the it is dropped. I am using
 the latest ver of Skype classic.</p>
<p>(Windows 10 Skype also quit loading.) </p>
<p>All other sounds with computer are fine, email alerts, music, and it works if I use Hangouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I usually use Skype many times a day for calls, but now have to start a hangout session.</p>

<p>Hi Danida,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the answers to your questions.</p>

<p>Internet - wireless radio dish&nbsp; (900 mhz xplornet)</p>
<p>Mic - Logitech 500 webcam</p>
<p>Problem&nbsp;occurs with skype to skype calls,&nbsp;all contacts ( do not use any other type of calls)</p>
<p>I did not mention that Skype also&nbsp;freezes and&nbsp;I have to reboot it to do anything. (one of my contacts is also experiencing this problem. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any ideas to solve this it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the information, Jim. Call drops are usually caused by the Internet connection you or your contact is using. Can you please try the following steps and let us know what happens after.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign out and quit Skype. <strong>Make sure that it is not running in the background.
</strong></li><li>Launch Run command by pressing Windows + R keys at the same time. </li><li>On the Run dialog box, type in <strong>%appdata%\Skype.</strong></li><li>This will open your Skype folder. Locate a file named <strong>shared.xml&nbsp; </strong>
or shared if your file extensions are hidden then delete it.</li><li>Next, locate a folder named after your Skype name and double click on it. </li><li>Delete a file named<strong> config.xml </strong>or config. </li><li>Exit and rename your entire Skype folder to <strong>Skype_Old</strong>.</li><li>Re-launch the Skype application.</li><li>Change connection and initiate a Skype call. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please also make sure that the latest driver updates are installed for your recording device.

<p>Hi Danida,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did almost you suggested, except change connection, and update drivers. I was not sure what you meant by change connection, and there are no recent updates for my older webcam.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you have any other ideas I will try them, but since skype quit working I have been using hangouts, and it seems&nbsp;to work fine. I would prefer Skype due to the ease of initiating&nbsp;a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jim</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I checked the internet speed this morning before making a call and it was well over the listed minimum speeds, and the call was still dropped.</p>

<p>Sorry, Jim what I meant by change connection is try changing the Internet connection you are using so we can isolate this case. There are certain cases wherein even though the Internet connection speed meets the recommended upload and download speed, calls
 are still dropping due to an issue on the Internet service provider restricting access or a Firewall blocking Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you check if the issue also happens when you are using your device's native microphone?

<p>Hi Danida,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am using a desktop&nbsp;computer, hard wired from the router. I had already tried bypassing the router and going from modem to computer directly, with the same results.I have no other&nbsp;internet supply to test with.&nbsp; My desktop does not have its own mic.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I spent quite awhile with Dell premium support while they went through and checked everything I have already checked, and they did not find any issue with the computer or settings for Skype. Although&nbsp;they are not Skype experts, they just checked for common
 setting errors and a few other settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can use Google Hangouts, TeamViewer, or&nbsp; Facebook video calls and do not seem to have issues with&nbsp;any other programs but Skype.</p>
<p>It seems like I might have to accept not using skype anymore unless you have any other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

<h2>            Computer Crash Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so as of about two weeks ago my computer crashes for what seems to be no reason at all. My computer usually crashes during a video game. I have spent hours looking through the event log and have turned up empty handed. I have a dump file that can
 be looked through. I would greatly appreciate&nbsp;if somebody would take a look and try and decode the problem for me. It is a google drive link to download the dump file in a .zip folder. Let me know if this method of sharing does not work.
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Tyler</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. Here is the link </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-5aqVFtKdMJZ2ttQjJad3lCZU0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Battle.net in the dump file is referring to the Battle.net associated with World of Warcraft. Just not quite sure what any of the dump file meant.</p>

            <p>My Computer just crashed again at 11:22 pm PST. My event viewer really didn't show any errors other than the critical computer shutdown. It had one 5 seconds after from the event log and it said "Audit events have been dropped by the transport.&nbsp; 0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were some errors that happened at 10:30 pm PST but other than that my computer just crashed almost randomly.</p>

<h2>            After installing windows 10 I get popup box &#34;How do you want to open this file&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded Lenovo Thinkcentre M70E (windows 7) to Windows 10. After starting the system I always get a popup box asking "How do you want to open this file". If I select notepad to open the file, I get the error message<br />
</p>
<div>"Cannot find the C:\program files\realtek\audio\had\rthdvcpl.exe -s file"</div>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the sound device</p>
<p>I have reinstalled realtek drivers/software</p>
<p>I can see the directory and files are in program files.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Windows 10 and reinstalled windows 10, and still getting this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: I suggest you to run the system file checker (SFC) as below and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform Automatic Repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refer to the following link:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Refer to the section "<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool</span></a> " in the above article for creating the tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to Press any key to boot from DVD, do so. If you dont see the message, you might need to change the boot order
 in your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to&nbsp;start the Windows Recovery Environment.</span></li><li><span>In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</span></li><li><span>Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Automatic Repair'.</span></li><li><span>After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

<p>I think that it's a Lenovo System problem, too.</p>
<p>I can tell you that if you make a clean install of W10 without maintaining your programs, the problem doesn't occur.</p>
<p>It seems that there's something in Lenovo's software that doesn't suit W10 </p>

            If, when installing W10 and being asked of what to maintain, you answer to maintain nothing, you obtain a clean install and the message doesn't appear.

            <p>I've found where the rthdvcpl.exe program is being started.</p>
<p>Lenovo has added a scheduled task.</p>
<p>So if you want to maintain all your programs when upgrading to W10 and want to solve the popup box, you can access your system scheduled tasks and disable the one named "realtekHDAudio" that is calling "c:\program files\realtek\audio\hda\rthdvcpl.exe -s".</p>
<p>Just go to Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Task Scheduler and disable it.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Thanks informaticaBajamar. That was very helpful. I took the easy route: </p>
<p><strong>system scheduled tasks and disable the one named "realtekHDAudio" </strong>
</p>
<p>I did not see the popup box after making the change, shutting down, and power on.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps and check if that works.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the Control panel, open the advanced power settings screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the power plan (ex: High performance) you want to reset its settings to default.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click/tap on OK to confirm.</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can also open the CMD window in admin mode and type this command powercfg restoredefaultschemes. Press enter after
 typing this command. </span></p>
<p><span>When finished, close the command prompt window.</span></p>

<h2>            remove virtual machine</h2>
                    Purchased 10" netbook-Acer Aspire One d270-from Acer. It came pre-hacked with virtualbox installed with Windows 7 as the GuestOS , and inaccessible from the desktop . The PC boots directly into the vm, first and only. Acer has refused to solve the problem.
 How to remove?

            Ask for you money back or format the drive and install win 7 on the physical machine.&nbsp; Installing it might require a license and might void the warranty

            Thanks- but Acer refuses to refund my money, fix or replace PC. A clean reinstall of the OS doesn't work - it installs on the virtual drive and not the HDD. The vm appears to be installed on the firmware-native boot ? I can't access it to uninstall.

            Dispute the charge with your back.&nbsp; Be persistent with Acer.&nbsp; What do they say as the reason they will not refund/replace?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 and Quicken 2014 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vikkiwelch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Quicken 2014</h2>
                    <p>I installed Quicken 2014 in January on my Windows 10 machine.&nbsp; Ran for 5 weeks but then stopped allowing me to open the data file yesterday.&nbsp; Quicken will open, allow me to backup my data file, just not open for any more entries.&nbsp; Not sure if a Windows update
 occurred just before or not.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling from CD.&nbsp; I tried using QcleanUI and then reinstalling.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>Also, when Quicken asks if I would like to send the error report, I get a failure on the send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>

<p>I tried contacting Quicken support number but they've been closed (I suppose through Presidents' Day) and so I'll keep trying.&nbsp; Just strange that it worked on my Windows 10 machine for five weeks and suddenly after a Windows' update (I'm pretty sure), it
 will not allow me to open the data file at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating.</p>

            The best way would be contacting the software vendor, but you should report it through Windows Feedback Hub too.
