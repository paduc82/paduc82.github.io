    <title>Where is my skype call recording&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is my skype call recording&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I was recently in a call with skype and one of one&nbsp;participants shared their screen throughout the call during which time I started to record the conference.&nbsp; The recording message and timer was visible at the top of the screen together with the
 security warning about making sure to let people know the call is being recorded.&nbsp; All was going well.&nbsp; I haven't been able to locate the recording, can anyone please advise?&nbsp; The conference call was very important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of skype is included below in the screen shot.</p>

<h2>            Login.scr error</h2>
                    
<p>Im running Vista home premium&nbsp; It boots up and after a black screen appears for about 6 minutes finally the logon screen appears. I see the icons for both of the user accounts but when I click on them, nothing happens it does not allow me to enter a password.
 You can tell in the background its doing stuff. I've let it sit this way for a day.<br />
I've also booted into safemode with the same event, except I get the logon.scr application failed to initialize properly, and then the screen goes black.<br />
<br />
I've booted to the Vista cd, and ran a repair which told me I need to disconnect any camera or music devics (everything is disconnected)<br />
I also restored to a very early point- still same problem <br />
I've run memory diagnostic- still same problem- memory is ok.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;As&nbsp;<strong>Malkeleah</strong> rightly said, it can be something to do with the hardware failure or corruption caused by a software. You can try
 performing chkdsk to see if it helps. If this does not help do try what Malkeleah has suggested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Boot into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRe).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Boot
 from the Windows Vista disk and press any key when prompted.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you get to the install windows screen, click&nbsp; <strong>Repair Your Computer.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you get to the System recovery Options click&nbsp; <strong>command prompt.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the command prompt shell type&nbsp; <strong>chkdsk /f </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Wait till the scan is completed and later restart the computer and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>While performing&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk
</strong>on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This could be caused by hardware failure or by software (corruption, malware) and there is no way to know which it is from here. Since you've already tried the startup repair, test the hard drive to make sure it is good (testing the RAM is OK but it is doubtful
 that the RAM caused your issue) and do a clean install/factory restore of Vista.</p>

<p>If you need to retrieve data first, you can do so from outside of Windows by one of the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a>

    <title>How do I do a backup for windows 7 and get back Windows from a backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a cooperator  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I do a backup for windows 7 and get back Windows from a backup copy &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi anyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do&nbsp;I do a backup for windows 7 and get back it from backup copy?</p>
<p>And after:<br />
I have windows 7 which is being installed on a Laptop(HP).<br />
When I firstly start up the laptop, I have done several steps for preparing the system for its first run after releasing it from the company. In the first step, I came across the option of choosing the type of language. Then,<strong><u> I have chosen Arabic
 because that I was expecting that I would be able to change it later at any time I want. However, that wasn't possible.</u></strong></p>
<p>Anyway, when I reached to the end of setup wizard of the system, I found out that there are two drives "C", on which windows 7 is being installed, and "D", on which "Recovery version" is being copied. After that, I had done a backup for Windows 7 with using
 a program(Backup and restore), which is integrated with windows 7.and then saved it in DVDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg846.imageshack.us%2fimg846%2f9248%2f65443964.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>My questions are as follows:</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
First:</p>
</strong>Is the backup I had saved in DVDs is a copy from the backup available on a 'D' drive?<br />
<p><strong>Second</strong>: as long as that the drive "D" still contains the "Recovery", can I restore the windows 7 from the "D", or I must restore the system from the backup available on DVD's?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Third:</strong> as long as I did the backup available on DVDs while the language of windows was Arabic, when I will be restoring the Windows 7 form the backup available on DVD's, I won't be coming across the option of choosing the type of language and
 immediatly the windows will be Arabic.</p>
<p><strong>Finally:</strong> as far as I know that the backup available of DVD's will be restored the windows to what it was on when it released from the company and also know that program (Backup and restore), which is integrated with Windows 7, enables me
 me to do backup once. Thus, if I want to do another backup for window 7 from this point and I want the backup to contain all the programs installed. I know there are far too many programs to do this, such as Norton Ghost, and CD Acronis True Image. However,
 I don't know the steps for doing that. Could anyone give me the steps with snapshots for doing&nbsp; backup for windows 7 and getting back it from the backup copy with using any softwares such as Norton Ghost or CD Acronis.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By the way, I have the CD of 'Norotn Ghost v11.0 CD Blackstar_tech', which is bootable.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would greatly appreciate your help</strong>.</p>

            There are a few simple answers to your questions:
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use a different language then you must perform a destructive Factory Restore. Check the HP home page for detailed instructions.</li><li>If you wish to maintain your existing configuration and installed programs then you can perform a restore from an image if you ever created one. However, this will not change the language.</li><li>Here are a couple of options to create an image of the existing installation:<br />
- Go to the Control Panel / Backup and Restore / Create a System Image.<br />
- Launch Acronis TrueImage and select "Disk Backup" (or the equivalent with Norton Ghost)<br />
- Boot the machine with your Acronis Rescue CD and select "Disk Backup"<br />
In each case I recommend that you back up to an external hard disk. DVDs are not a good choice.</li></ul>

            <p>Thank you very much indeed.</p>
<p>As I said before that the&nbsp;backup copy which is available on D, I didn't create it. However it was created by the factory.</p>
<p>I only created a backup copy on DVDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, now I have two choices to restore a windows 7:</p>
<p>The first from D and the other from DVDs</p>
<p><strong>First :</strong>&nbsp; Will either ways enable me to chose the a different language?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second&nbsp;:</strong> Could you give me any steps supported <u>with snapshots</u> to create a back up for windows 7&nbsp;and restore the windows from the backup created with using some software, such as Acronis TrueImage?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>If you wish to maintain your existing configuration and installed programs then you can perform a restore from an image if you ever created one. However, this will not change the language.

<p>&nbsp;Yes, I know that this will not give me an option to change the language when I restore from the new backup I will be creating. However, I want to create a backup&nbsp;to&nbsp;maintain my existing configuration and installed programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a question here, I have much data whose&nbsp;size &nbsp;is about&nbsp;460GB,&nbsp;but it is&nbsp;as copies such as (films, documents, photos and&nbsp;copies of programs which are not installed and so on). So, I don't want the back up to include this data. How can I separate this
<p><strong>Are there any tools in Windows 7 to&nbsp;cut/copy/move this data and paste it in an&nbsp;external hard disk? Or I should collect it together then cut and paste it in&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;external hard disk?</strong></p>
<p>Because I am afraid that if I manually collect this data and then cut and paste it&nbsp;into&nbsp;another&nbsp;external&nbsp;HD, I will forget some of it and then it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;included with the new backup copy or it will be lost after&nbsp;perform the backup from a destructive Factory
 Restore</p>

<p>
<i><strong>First :</strong>&nbsp; Will either ways enable me to chose the a different language?</i></p>
<p>
-&gt; I do not know what this "backup copy on drive D:" is. If it is part of the original Factory Restore mechanism then it will. You need to check the documentation for your machine to find out, consult the FAQs for this model or ask the manufacturer's help desk.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
-&gt; Sorry, I cannot afford the time to write a detailed manual for you. You need to check Windows Help (Start / Help) and the Acronis documentation to find out about these things.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
-&gt; This is a good question. My method goes like this:</p>
<p>
1. When I configure a brand new machine then I always split the hard disk like so:<br />
- 100 GBytes for Windows and for all applications<br />
- The rest for my data.</p>
<p>
2. I store all data on drive D:.</p>
<p>
3. My images cover only drive C:.</p>

<p>
Windows Explorer will let you do this, or xcopy.exe or robocopy.exe from a Command Prompt.</p>

    <title>Headsets no longer working on Xbox One S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fireball1047  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headsets no longer working on Xbox One S</h2>
                    <p>For some reason my son's headsets no longer works with Xbox One S - works on all other devices (the Xbox controller is the new version not the old on ~ 6 months old).&nbsp; I think it's the Xbox system resulting from an update installed back
 in November - system simply no longer recognizes the headset.&nbsp; We assumed my son's headset stopped working (Turtle Beach) because&nbsp;it was broken but discovered it wasn't when the 2 new ones we bought him recently also didn't work.&nbsp; I think I've tried all the
 trouble shooting suggestions (e.g., spent hours doing soft reset of system, changing his settings so he's now an&nbsp;adult with no restrictions, tried updating controller (no updates available), etc.).&nbsp; We've tested both headsets on 3 different controllers, his
 friends are having similar problems, so I can't see this being a problem with the controller (e.g., the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">3.5-mm audio jack)</span>, it appears to be related to the
 November&nbsp;software update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your issue.&nbsp; You have already done most of the troubleshooting steps we recommend first.&nbsp; You didn't mention it, but I will assume you have checked your audio setting to make sure your system is set for headset output and your chat mixer
 isn't set for chat sounds only.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you haven't already done it, I would also clear the local saved game cache and clear your MAC address.&nbsp; Perform a power cycle of the Xbox (unplugging the power) and shut down your router/network at the same time (unplug
 from power).&nbsp; Plug everything in and restart.&nbsp; If none of that works, I recommend requesting a call back from support.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></span>

<p><span><span><br />
You may not have sound for one of several reasons. Try the following: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Check that the volume is not turned down too low by turning up the volume (click
<strong>VOL+</strong>&nbsp;)</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Check whether the sound has been muted. (Click
<strong>Mute</strong> &nbsp; to enable sound.)</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Make sure your speakers are plugged in to the appropriate connection on your computer and working correctly.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Check whether the Microsoft Windows system volume needs adjustment. For more information about adjusting the volume
 in the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, see </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Adjust-the-speaker-volume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Adjust the speaker volume</span></a><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Make sure the appropriate selections are made in the
<strong>DVD</strong> settings. (On the <strong>start</strong> screen, scroll to <strong>
Tasks</strong>, click <strong>settings</strong>, click <strong>DVD</strong>, click
<strong>DVD Language</strong> and then click the <strong>–</strong> or <strong>+</strong> under
<strong>Audio track</strong>.)</span></span> </li></ul>
<p><span><span>For audio to work as expected, you may need to configure the
<strong>DVD Audio</strong> settings.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Try configuring your speakers using
<strong>Set Up Your Speakers</strong> in Windows Media Center. (On the <strong>start</strong> screen, scroll to
<strong>Tasks</strong>, click <strong>settings</strong>, click <strong>General</strong>, click
<strong>Windows Media Center Setup</strong>, and then click <strong>Set Up Your Speakers</strong>.)</span></span>

    <title>Cortana not searching internet, missing toggle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignats0883  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana not searching internet, missing toggle</h2>
                    Hello. Since last update Windows 10, Cortana only searches on my computer instead of searching internet as well. Also, the toggle to turn on/off the internet is gone. It says in search bar "Search Windows". It doesn't say "ask me anything anymore". I've
 tried checking for more updates, troubleshooting in control panel, logging in to both accounts on laptop, restarted the computer 3 times, and can't remember rest. Does anyone know how to fix this?

<p>I know how to repair the shortcut in the adminsitration panel....</p>

<h2>            Surface book 2 i7 8GB RAM 256SSD slow SSD write speed</h2>
                    <p>I've bought Surface Book 2 with 256 GB SSD storage and gettings strage write performance</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/434816a5-33f9-4132-8eb7-5bb01161fdd0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/434816a5-33f9-4132-8eb7-5bb01161fdd0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've search for same issues on microsoft answers and reddit and found a lot of threads regarding Surface Book 2 (and other surface lineup) SSD slow write speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I didn't find any exact answer from Microsoft representatives is it "<strong>by design"&nbsp;</strong>or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can definitely say that all surface books 2 with same 256GB SSD in my local store have the same write speed.</p>
<p>512GB model in our local store have approx 620MB/s</p>
<p>1TB models in our local store have aprox 1200MB/s</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is if it is normal write speed for 256GB models and intended to be "<strong>by design"</strong> or I should send my surface book 2 back to microsoft for repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>No; you have to physically install the hard drive in to your machine then install Windows 7 on it.</p>

<h2>            READ&#33; The Social Side of Xbox one is RUINING XBOX&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an issue with the way everything is with the sharing, following, liking part of Xbox One social side. &nbsp;Before anyone goes of at me, I once created videos and got a little known from it but have recently quit doing so, but i quit because of many reasons.<br />
<br />
People are creating videos and sharing them and getting followers and becoming ''known''. &nbsp;They beg for you to add them and they don't add you back.. Because they would like to look like there famous and people follow them because they are fans.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
People spam all the time ''MTARP''(Message to all recent players) PLEASE FOLLOW ME, I CREATE VIDEOS BLAH BLAH BLAH) And it's even to the point if you do like someones video, someone will find you from that and message you to follow them and like there videos!<br />
<br />
It's turning into ''How many followers you have is how cool you are'' instead of enjoying games and not worrying about getting famous.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I miss how Xbox One originally was without all the begging for followers, people thinking there better because they get 50 likes on a video from asking people to like it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I personally think Xbox should limit how many ''followers'' you can get to solve this issue. And maybe limit how many post per day you can do. Oh and also limit how many messages you can send out a day!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also im on a old account here if your wondering why i have no friends.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Many people agree with me on this. So please consider this option...&nbsp;</p>

<br />Which version are you on?  I'd Upgrade now to Version 1809 if you've not yet, by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

The Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter comes with your wireless card. You probable have an Intel wireless adapter with My WiFi Technology.
<br />
<br />
You can install the drivers from <a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/wireless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel® Driver Update Utility for wireless networking</a> or you might be able to right click on the Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter, then left click uninstall. Restart your computer and the adapter will reinstall itself.<br />
<br />
Please do NOT uncheck the power management boxes for this device or it goes missing.<br />
<br />

            If you view Hidden and System files, you will see two files called hiberfil.sys and pagefil.sys - these are the files that control hibernation and paged memory. They will be quite big. Also you need to check how much disk space is being used by System
 restore.<br />

            <p>It looks as if CenturyLink email is in a state of flux at the moment, so you may be caught up in the change. Check whether you have to enter your full email address at the

</p><p>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the

 couple of hours for the new password to percolate through the server systems, then try again.</p>

<h2>            PAL game saves on NTSC HDD</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I currently live in NZ and have a PAL console playing with PAL games. I am planning on moving back to Canada next year, and I will sell my PAL 360 with the region-locked games and buy a new NTSC console once I'm there...but my question is: If I transfer my
 game save files from my current HDD (PAL) on a USB flash drive or something, to my new NTSC console's HDD, will the game files still work? Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure, but the game saves should be fine, as it's just a data file. I don't beleive there will be any difference. The only difference is the disc. You'll need to by a NTSC copy of the game obviously.</p>
