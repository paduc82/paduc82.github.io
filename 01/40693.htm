<h2>            Using Xbox with PC monitor</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having problems using my Xbox with my PC monitor. When I connect my Xbox via HDMI, the picture looks very bad. I have tried playing around with all the resolution settings on the console, and the graphics still look terrible. The picture looks
 stretched, as though there is no anti-aliasing whatsoever. The picture looks very crisp when I play PC games, so I am confused as to why the Xbox doesn't look good. I recently had the privilege of playing
<em>Gears of War 3</em> on an HDTV, and it looked incredible. I wish it would look that way on my monitor.</p>
<p>I'm not really an expert when it comes to monitors or TVs, but I am assuming this problem is because my monitor lacks the upscaling capabilities of an HDTV. If that is the case, I was wondering if anyone knows a way I can fix this. I know there are upscalers
 you can buy for DVD players, and I was wondering if these would work for an Xbox as well.</p>
<p>My monitor is a 24" Samsung SyncMaster P2450H, with an aspect ratio of 16:9, if that helps.</p>

            <p>Is the 360 set to widescreen or normal? How about your monitor? It sounds like there is a setting mismatch on one or the other. </p>

<p><span>Hi Azyle,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When a new device that was recently added to your computer system, it needs a driver update to let your peripherals run properly on your computer. If the plug and play feature doesn’t work, you will need to install it manually or scan for hardware
 changes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here’s what you can do:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Visit this link: <strong><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers in Windows 10</a></span></strong></span>
 to know how to perform a driver update for your devices. </li><li><span>Use the <strong>Device Manager</strong> to detect your computer for hardware changes. To do this, follow the steps below:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Make sure that you are connected to the Internet.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open<strong> Run </strong>window.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Type </span><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">devmgmt.msc</span></em><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">, then press
<strong>Enter </strong>to launch <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>Device Manager</strong>, click your computer so it will be highlighted.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Action</strong>, then click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Wait for your computer to scan the hardware that were attached to it.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If updating through <strong>Device Manager</strong> did not install your device, you may visit the website of your computer manufacturer and download the drivers manually to update it.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if this works for you.</span></p>

<h3> nathan roberts &#40;sunknath&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t play my Xbox Game on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><em>Forum Article applies to: Xbox on Windows &amp; Xbox Console</em></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Some people may take advantage of their Gold Membership for Xbox live so they are able to play online or buy games at a discount - with Deals with Gold. People may even download free games with their Gold membership that become available to them each month.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While a lot of these games are available on Xbox Consoles. Some are games which can be played on Windows 10 . However, some people have problems playing these games on Windows 10 and their Consoles. This article goes through some troubleshooting methods
 you can do to get you back, playing your game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 - Making sure you have purchased the game</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes we have different accounts to keep our gaming stuff separate to our personal stuff. We may even have two accounts because we have an account that was used to set up the Xbox Account for our children or relatives. If you find that your getting an
 error "You do not own the game" then please go to:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to sign into your account. When your signed in, please go to Payments and billing, then to purchases (Which is found on the top navigation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will lead you to your purchase history. It tells you when you made the purchase and what payment method you have used. You will need to scroll down until you find the game you have purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't find the game your looking for? The chances are your signed into the wrong account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign into your other Microsoft Account and see if it is listed on there. Once you find it listed, you will need to sign into store using your other account. To do that, first go to Microsoft Store on Windows 10. Select your profile picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70aedc0b-18d4-4c60-9e2f-91a6357491ea?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70aedc0b-18d4-4c60-9e2f-91a6357491ea?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your on Xbox one, then you can not add another account to store. You will have to sign into your Xbox console using the other Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 - Do you have an active Gold membership for Xbox Live? (Applies if you have bought the game from Deals with Gold or downloaded it as a free game with Gold)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have bought a game from the Deals with Gold section of the Store app on Windows and Xbox, and you can not play the game, then make sure you still have a subscription for Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, please go to:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a> and sign into your Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your directed to the Microsoft account overview page, click onto Services and Subscriptions. You will be directed to a page that lists all of your subscriptions attached to your Microsoft account. If you do not see anything under Active subscriptions,
 then you will need to buy Xbox Membership before you can play the games you have bought from the Deals with Gold page, and the Free Games with Gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To buy Xbox membership, scroll down to Cancelled subscriptions and select renew under Xbox Live Gold. After this, you should be good to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 - Making sure your computer/device meets the system requirements</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft store checks your device to make sure your device meets the requirements. If it does not, then the game will not open or download. This is to stop you from running into problems with your game and damaging your computer/device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check to see if the game is available for the device your using, please go to the Microsoft Store App on your device. Then search for the game you want to download. Scroll down and check the system requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to check to see if the game is a Game on Windows. If it isn't, then you won't be able to play it. This will be reviled when you look at the game in the Marketplace. The requirements page will look something like this:</p>

<h2>            Taskbar Aero Peek Not Working - MS Excel 2007 Shows Generic Icon Only</h2>
                    Hi - I'm having problems with Aero Peek for open windows on the task bar. Functionality works correctly for Word 2007 but doesn't work for Excel 2007. When you hover over Excel icon on taskbar popup correctly show icons for open windows with titles but
 shows generic icon only - not preview of window. When you move over icon then Excel window doesn't popup - only when you click on it.<br />
<br />
I've tried using Aero Peek Troubleshooter but doesn't find any problems. I've tried Excel Advance Option for 'show all windows' but this doesn't affect problem either.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions advice appreciated. (OS Windows 7 Professional 64 bit - was clean install not upgrade)

            Hey guys, there's info about this on the net (Paul Thurrott's site, WinSuperSite.com, has covered it).
<div><br />
<div>Excel is what you call an MDI interface. &nbsp;You can read about it on Wikipedia. &nbsp;Basically, each Excel window is basically the same incarnation that a tab would be in a browser. &nbsp;I can't think of any other MDI programs that come with Windows anymore, but
 old examples of similar programs include the File Manager or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface#Application_examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
several examples</a> on Wikipedia.</div>

<div>To get it's <em>child</em>&nbsp;windows (documents) to appear as separate application instances on the taskbar, Excel does some tricky stuff that isn't really optimal. &nbsp;It's basically tricking the taskbar into showing them. &nbsp;Because of this, no preview of child
 documents, unless you launch an entire new instance of Excel (so that the two documents are&nbsp;cousins (or step children?), rather than siblings of the same 'parent' window).</div>
<div><br />
<div>In Office 2010, they fix this issue by using some documented Windows 7 enhancements to how the taskbar works (more info about that on MSDN).</div>
<div><br />
<div><em>Although I wish they'd just make Excel work the same way as Word: open an entire new instance for each document. &nbsp;But alas, that would probably break backwards compatibility with some old macros, and they can't risk losing business customers over that</em>.</div>

<h2>            Snapping to four corners of screen</h2>
                    As I drag certain windows around on my desktop, blue lines split the screen into four. While dragging and holding control or alt the lines disappear and I can move freely, but I don't want to hold those buttons down every time. I do not want this to happen
 anymore, how do I stop it from happening?

            You were correct, it had nothing to do with Windows 7. After much frustration and looking around I finally found out that software that came with my monitor (Samsung Multiscreen) was snapping everything into a grid. I must have pressed a wrong key combination
 to activate this option. Thank you for the quick response.

<h2>            ipoint.exe &#40;Intellipoint software&#41; keeps telling me to insert a missing disk.</h2>
                    Whenever I start my computer, ipoint.exe (the software for the Microsoft optical mouse) keeps telling me to insert a disk, or that a disk is missing. This software does not require a disk. How do I keep it from repeatedly opening this pop-up window? (I
 have to close it half a dozen times before it stays closed.)

            I also have this exact problem with Intellipoint. I uninstalled and reinstalled version 8 and that didn't fix the problem. Also, I have confirmed this by using MSCONFIG.EXE to disable it upon boot and the problem went away.

<h3> pinkgm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech gamepad f710 driver unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Since the installation of the October 17 2017 upgrade I have an issue with my Logitech f710 driver.&nbsp; When I go to settings devices I see Logitech f710 gamepad listed however it says driver is unavailable.&nbsp; If I go to device manager under other devices I
 see Wireless gamepad f710 with a yellow triangle.&nbsp; I right click on Wireless gamepad f710 and ran scan for hardware issues, however nothing happens.&nbsp; I tried right clicking on Wireless gamepad f710 and ran update driver I received the message&nbsp; Windows could
 not find drivers for your device.&nbsp; I tried going to settings Windows update and receive the message your device is up to date.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling &nbsp; Logitech software then reinstalling the drivers and software directly from Logitech website.&nbsp; I tried rebooting
 my Asus ROG G750 laptop.&nbsp; Please help me with my next step as to how to get my gamepad working.&nbsp; please note before this upgrade I had absolutely no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. <br />
That often will work when running from the recovery environment does <br />
not. You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. <br />
You would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool.

</p>
<p><br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />

<p>Is this computer at home and wired? If yes, it is likely e-mail scanning causing this. Depending on your AV program, you may need to reinstall it.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<h2>            Laptop having problems with my graphic tablet. &#40;Windows 8 vs. Adesso Cybertablet M14&#41;</h2>
                    I currently have an HP Notebook 2000 PC with windows 8, and an Adesso Cybertablet M14. The problem is that when I go to use my tablet, the pressure sensitivity doesn't work. When I went to find the pressure manager, it was nowhere to be found! I've tried
 to uninstall and re-install multiple times, as well as updating the drivers just in case. The issue is that no matter what I try, the pressure doesn't work. It seems like the computer is just reading it as a mouse. A strange fact is that when I uninstall the
 drivers for my tablet completely, my laptop still detects it and still allows the tablet to work (without pen pressure still).
<div>The tablet as an individual works fine, I know that for sure since it works fine on my desktop. But on my desktop, I can actually access the setting of my tablet from the Control Panel, while I cannot on my laptop. While my laptop does have a tablet setting
 there, it is not for my Adesso.</div>
<div>We've tried going to Devices and Printers to locate the Tablet, but to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We don't know what to do next. Help please! I would like to get back to making art as soon as possible!</div>

<p>Hi Katelynn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community and we are glad that you have chosen Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, the pressure sensitivity doesn't work does not work on the Adesso CyberTablet M14 device connected to your Windows 8 computer and you are unable to access the Pressure Manager to change the settings of the device. Please let me know,
 if I got it wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to have more information about this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>How did you install the drivers for this device? Was it downloaded and installed from the Adesso website or was it automatically loaded by Windows 8 as soon as it was connected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the device status shown in the Device Manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can open the Device Manager by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “X”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Device Manager”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Compatibility Center shows that the Adesso CyberTablet M14 is compatible with Windows 8 and also all the Windows 8 necessary drivers and software are available in the Adesso website.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this issue let’s first run the Hardware troubleshooter and check if that helps. If troubleshooter is not able to find any issue,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>then let’s uninstall the existing drivers from the computer and install the latest drivers from the Adesso website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details and on how to fix them. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Hardware and Devices”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Install the latest drivers for the device.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try running the Windows Update and check if there are any driver updates available. Windows Update can automatically download and install recommended updates. Installing any important, recommended, and optional updates can update system features
 and other software that might help fix many driver issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the Windows updates, try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys to search Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “Windows Updates” in the search bar and press “Enter” on the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Check for updates” and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install all the updates available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to find any driver updates after running the Windows updates, then try reinstalling the drivers and related software from the driver CD that you might have received with the laptop or download and install it from the manufacturer’s website.
 You can download the drivers and the necessary software from this link:</p>

            I'm having a similar problem, with an Adesso Cybertablet z12. I got it because I love how it works on my girlfriend's laptop, which is a windows 7, but I can't get the pressure sensitivity to work at all on my windows 8 laptop. I've installed the driver
 both online and from the disc, but it won't work. I tried running the troubleshooting and such, but my computer thinks the tablet is working just fine. Also, the tablet FAQ link you provided is broken.

    <title>Windows 10 bug with VB6 textboxes where the multiline property is set - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvsu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 bug with VB6 textboxes where the multiline property is set to &#39;True&#39; and Windows 10 is in Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>The title should be self explanatory but when:</p>
<p>- Windows 10 is in Tablet Mode</p>
<p>- VB6 application either compiled or in the IDE</p>
<p>- any textbox control where the multiline property is set to 'true'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The textbox always appears with a height of one line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered this problem, and is there a work-around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you Jenith. I have posted the problem in MSDN forums. However, this does not seem to be a VB problem. It only occurs in Windows 10 and only when Windows 10 Tablet Mode is on. A textbox functions normally when Tablet Mode is off and in all other versions
 of Windows.<br />

    <title>Xbox One Elite Controller d-pad wobble - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmxyz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller d-pad wobble</h2>
                    
<p>I got my Elite controller a few weeks ago and I'm very happy with it so far, but the d-pad keeps bothering me. It's not like it doesn't do it's job or anything - it works perfectly in fact, but every time I put my thumb on the left side of it I can feel
 the wobble and it slowly drives me crazy. I'm pretty sure I need to get a replacement controller but I'd like some input from other Elite controller-owners first.</p>
<p>Please watch the video I uploaded:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Z2QyO-65d_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/Z2QyO-65d_c</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z2QyO-65d_c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z2QyO-65d_c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>As you can see in the video this affects both included D-pads, so I think it's safe to assume the controller itself is faulty. If you own an Elite controller, please chime in and let me know if your d-pad is wobbly as well, because if it's not, I'm gonna
 have to get mine replaced.</p>
<p>A video would be perfect ;D</p>

<p>I don't have the Elite controller but if you are having issues with it you should get it exchanged before too much times goes by and they won't exchange it. &nbsp;Sure, get feedback from other users just don't continue to wait. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>
