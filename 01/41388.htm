    <title>Will OEM based Windows 10 Home installation leadto harware warranty as - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will OEM based Windows 10 Home installation leadto harware warranty as VOID &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you are doing well. I recently did a NEW PC build for myself (personal use and gaming) and installed a Windows 10 Home (activated via OEM based product key) on my motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After working for a while (exactly 3 months), my motherboard (MSI Z370 Gaming Pro Carbon) got busted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, MSI is mentioning that due to installation of OEM based Windows version, the warranty of my motherboard is VOID and I cannot claim a replacement in its name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per I have read in numerous places on web, I thought that I was eligible for a Builder's OEM since I did the build for myself and with the brand news hardware as well. I only wanted to use the Windows copy on 1 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions here-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is using a OEM based Windows voids warranty for hardware components like motherboard?</p>
<p>2) How can a Windows OEM version could cause a hardware failure?</p>
<p>3) Have I, unknowingly, voided the warranty for my motherboard with this or my motherboard manufacturer (MSI) is trying to ditch me on the warranty?
</p>
<p>4) Does even installing OEM version under Builder's OEM is considered/supports piracy? Will my copy would be considered as NON GENUINE even though I am getting regular updates from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response on this would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Shashank Chaudhary</p>

<br />1. No, haven't heard so.
<br />2. Not possible that Windows leads to a hardware failure.
<br />3. MSI is trying to avoid warranty replacement.
<br />4. No, not an issue. But Microsoft warns that buying products key separately is not a good practice as the keys might be stolen or counterfeit.

<p>Thanks Sumit (not Greg 😉)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway i can fight them on this using valid arguments? They are simply saying that since its OEM, it means keys is saved in BIOS. Which ultimately means, BIOS was updated which voids the warranty. I mean how are they pinning the hardware failure
 on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this would be 2nd request for replacement. The 1st replacement was received by me just 2-3 days back.I bought another OEM key for new motherboard. The PC worked for 3 days and then on the 4th day, it just didn't turned on. I have bought 2 OEM keys
 by now which is only because of such random and frequent motherboard failures.</p>

<p>1.</p>
<p>There can be a problem when the installer writes manufacturer/license information to the firmware or unlicensed OEM keys are used
</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g.</p>
<p>If you had a Supermicro motherboard in a Dell machine, you would not have a warranty with Supermicro - you would have a warranty with Dell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem usually occurs when an OEM DM or OEM SLP install is used. These are only available to computer manufacturers such as HP or Dell and therefore there is no warranty with the motherboard manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you receive a license/COA with your key?</p>
<p>Is the install media Microsoft or something else?</p>
<p>If you have the invoice showing the serial number, then contact MSI again and tell them you can prove it was bought retail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. </p>
<p>It can't cause hardware damage</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.</p>
<p>see 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.</p>
<p>In some markets, you can buy an OEM license retail, but this will not be DM or SLP.</p>

<h2>            No Good Notifications for Messages or Calls&#63;</h2>
                    So since being forced to use this version of skype, me and all my friends are hugely frustrated with it.&nbsp; The problem is if you're not at your computer when you get a message or a call, there is no way of knowing that you got a call or message.&nbsp; You get
 the little chat bubble on the bottom right of the screen, but it's very small on the current screen resolutions these days, and it's static.&nbsp; Before on skype you got a pop up of the message on your screen and a highlighted and/or blinking window bar in the
 task bar.&nbsp; We're not noticing messages and calls for literally days some times, and there was never a problem with this before.&nbsp; Why is there no better alerts about these?&nbsp; It worked very well before, now everyone I know is complaining about the same problem.&nbsp;
 Is there something I'm missing on should be giving better notifications?&nbsp; If not, please add the pop ups or the blinking indication that you had something come in.&nbsp; Why doesn't the not

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Do you get any error message along with the blue screen?<br />
•&nbsp;Were there any changes prior to this issue?<br />
•&nbsp;How frequently does the blue screen occur?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check what happens in safe mode.</p>
<p>“Start your computer in safe mode “ <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: if the issue does not happen in safe mode, perform clean boot.</p>
<p>In Clean Boot, windows use a minimal set of services and startup programs so that software conflict is eliminated. To put the computer in clean boot state follow the steps in the article “How to perform Clean Boot”<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Also refer to “<strong>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</strong>”&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a></p>
<p>As it is a new computer, you can also get in touch with the manufacturer since the computer would be under warranty.</p>

    <title>Error updating xbox 360 recently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drethedog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error updating xbox 360 recently</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, There was a recent update pushed to Xbox 360 that is required before you can log into LIVE. I've been trying for a few days and even at different locations to get this to install without error. It just will not seem to clear up. The install downloads,
 gets to 80%, but then drops to any various lower percentage until it pops up an error message to be seen below.</p>
<p>Steps I've taken:</p>
<p>Cleared off space from the 120 GB hard drive attached to my console (Xbox 360 Elite).</p>
<p>Reseat the hard drive.</p>
<p>Clear cache.</p>
<p>Say no to update, go to network settings and test LIVE connection, then do the update. This has worked twice, but below explanations happen each time.</p>
<p>Install update via USB, which works momentarily. I'll eventually get logged into LIVE, but then I either locks up the system when I open something, or it says I'm missing some components. Restarts the system and insists on installing the update again and
 again eventually timing out.</p>
<p>The update has installed via wireless network, but does just as it does above.</p>
<p>Deleted xbox live profile. Thought this final task would work, but it didn't.</p>
<p>At this point I'm all out of ideas.</p>
<p>ERROR MESSAGE:</p>
<pre>Can't download the update. To test your connection, open System Settings and select Network Settings, Test Xbox LIVE Connection<br /><br />If the problem persists, go to www.exbox.com/support<br /><br />Status Code:<br />3F4A - 0000 - 3080 - 0506 - 8B05 - 0018</pre>

<pre>I get this via wireless, and ethernet.</pre>
<pre>Help me Xbox-wan, you're my only hope!</pre>

<h3> reknor320  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does any one know how to fix file associations in windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have windows 10 x64 installed and I have installed irfanview x64 to open, and edit images, at first windows didn't want to let it take any file associations at all, and now it has managed most, but I am still completely unable to set .bmp to open with
 irfanview. There is some serious problem with the associations in windows 10, as I set the option to open all images with irfanview in its settings, and windows will not even acknowledge the change and revert back to there horrible photos app, which it doesn't
 even want to let us get rid of. Furthermore I go into settings, file associationd, and select photos, and it doesn't even come up with Irfanview, even though it is installed on the system, and it doesn't have a dialogue to select the programme like previous
 versions either. Does anyone know if Microsoft is ever going to fix this fault?. Or does anyone know of any workaround to fix this error in windows?.

<p>
</p><p>You would have to register it first to see it there.&nbsp; A better tactic is to find a .bmp file using File Explorer and then use its Open with... dialog to find the program you want to use via this arcane sequence:&nbsp; Choose another app...&nbsp; More apps...&nbsp; Look
 for another app on this PC.&nbsp; Then check the box:&nbsp; Always use this app to open .bmp files.</p>

<p>Roberts solution only works now on single use. There is now no check box to always use this app.</p>
<p>Something has changed very recently and this is one of my major fears realised in migrating to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I Use the Arduino development system with . PDE files and I have found no way to associate the .PDE extension with the Arduino program. It try's to force the Notepad app which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>If I&nbsp;try to set an association in Windows it tries to force the adoption of some lame and inappropriate Apps in the Windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is probably a method to set associations by editing the registry, but this is not acceptable in a consumer operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, chime in here and show how to fix this ridiculous set of circumstances,&nbsp;or advise when this fault will be corrected.</p>

<p>First of all, do you hear the USB 'ding' sound when you connect the camera to the PC?</p>
<p>You do not tell us which Vivitar digital camera you have, there are 28 listed at vivitar.com so it's difficult for us to try and work out what is happening, but I'd try uninstalling any software from the Control Panel, Programs &amp; Features that you have already
 installed, then try the download again, and when you start the file, instead of doubleclicking on it, right click and highlight Run As Administrator and see if that works.</p>
<p>If there is no 'ding' sound, then the camera is not talking to the PC at all, drivers or no drivers.</p>
<p>The other alternative (if possible, and always the best option) is to use a card reader.</p>

            <p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>At the command prompt, enter the following commands</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sfc/scannow</p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system<br />
-----------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try uninstalling again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persist:</p>
<p>If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it only happen with mouse or all the USB devices?</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows can't find the driver you need, it will prompt you to insert the disc containing the driver that came with your device.</span></p>
<p><span>Occasionally you might have a USB device that did not come with a disc containing a driver and for which Windows cannot find a driver. In this case, you can look for a driver on the device manufacturer's
 website. You can often download drivers from the support section of such sites. If you are unable to find a driver there, try contacting the manufacturer. You may try downloading the drivers from the below link after selecting the appropriate file(32 bit or
 64 bit)</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-au/428/6540?section=downloads&amp;bit=&amp;osid=13&amp;selectedFile=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/en-au/428/6540?section=downloads&amp;bit=&amp;osid=13&amp;selectedFile=0</a></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Reinstall the USB controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press windows key, type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press "Enter". Click “Continue” if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In Device Manager, Use the tab and the arrow key to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", and enter each devices under controllers and uninstall the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</span></p>
<p><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows Vista will reinstall all USB controllers automatically. Then check what happens.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi DonaldLaw,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may happen if any updates failed to install.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the system is not booting to normal mode for a long time, you can try to restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to boot in normal mode, you can try the steps provided in the following article to perform a System restore either from a safe mode or
 booting from Windows 7 full versiom Installation disc and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and
 the computer restarts when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the following link, to perform a Startup repair if System restore fails.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What are the system recovery
 options in Windows 7?</a> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p>
<span>When you are able to boot in normal mode, you can check the windows update history to see if any recent updates failed to install.</span></p>

<h2>            Not getting any rewards back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've noticed the last few months that XBL&nbsp;Rewards seems to not be giving me any money at all back from what I was getting last year and even back in January I&nbsp;ended up getting $66 or so back from rewards which was nice. Just did the Red Dead offer last Thursday to get points which still aren't showing up, and have spent over $200 the last month or two and I'm not getting any money back from my purchases even though I'm a 5Star VIP. I'm literally going to just spend less than&nbsp;I used to at this point when you seemingly don't want to give me my 10% back.</p><p><br /></p><p>I tried contacting your twitter support first, which was terrible by the way. They told me that I&nbsp;can't get any rewards back since I'm a 5 Star VIP which makes no sense at all. Literally fix the issue with this program and help me understand why I'm not getting rewards back anymore.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;EliteShadowMan,</p><p><br /></p><p>From our FAQ:</p><p><br /></p>
<p><b>When will my MyVIP Rewards Credits be deposited into my Microsoft account?</b>
  </p>
<p>The total Rewards earned will be calculated at the end of each month. Typically you'll receive your MyVIP earnings in your account by the 15th of the following month, though this is subject to the program's current deposit <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms</a>. Be sure to keep an eye on MyStatement on the <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyRewards</a> page to track your progress and watch your Rewards Credits total grow!
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>We have not yet calculated last&nbsp;month's MyVIP, so it is too early to see the Credits pending. Since MyVIP is calculated as a monthly whole, it would also be too early to see Credits for July.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Regarding your Red Dead purchase for Throwback Thursday, we are currently recovering from a purchase data delay that caused processing for purchases made around the end of June and the beginning of July to be delayed. Apologies for the inconvenience. We are working with another team to get this information caught up as soon as possible, and hope to have purchases from that date range calculated shortly.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Cannot login after migrating OS to new SSD</h2>
                    I have just purchased a new Samsung 840 Pro SSD today and successfully (so I thought) migrated my OS to it. The issue I am having is when I make the SSD my primary drive in the BIOS and try to login it just says " The user profile service failed the logon.
 User profile cannot be loaded". So I currently am unable to use Windows 8 on my SSD but it loads fine on my HDD. Help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either something went wrong migrating, or for some reason you are being logged in as a Temporary User... You could check that in User Accounts....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Paragon has the option to create an Image of your OS Partition, you might try that...</p>
<p>Then restore the Image to the SSD...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that your SSD was assigned a drive letter other than C:\ ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a Win 8 installation Disk or Repair Disk, you might try booting with it and doing a Startup\Boot repair...</p>

            Hi Markin, some Vostro's do not have the ability to enable TPM
<br />
<br />If your system does, try this method:
<br />
<br />Disable BitLocker in the Services Application
<br />
<br />Restart the system, and Press F2 to enter the BIOS
<br />
<br />Disable Secure Boot in the BIOS
<br />
<br />Under Security Settings: Disable PTT, Enable TPM, Activate TPM, then save those changes
<br />
<br />Restart to the operating system and enable BitLocker       
        </p>

<p><span>Hello Smorais,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are five basic types of jacks, or ports involved:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>*Composite/phono plug (RCA)</span></p>
<p><span>*S-Video</span></p>
<p><span>*Video graphics array (VGA)</span></p>
<p><span>*Digital video interface (DVI)</span></p>
<p><span>*High-definition multimedia interface (HDMI)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>TV’s with a single digital port labeled HDMI/DVI require only one cable when the source is another HDMI component. But when
 source is a DVI laptop, you need a DVI-to-HDMI cable for the video and a separate pair of RCA analog stereo cables.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Whenever ports do not match, you can buy adaptors and/or cables to make any connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also open the "display settings" in your Vista computer and activate output to the TV screen. You can either mirror content
 of your computer on the TV or extend the display just like a dual monitor screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Pick up your TV remote and switch to "External Inputs" from the menu. You will need to change the default "Video 1" to a different
 selection which may be "HDMI 1" or "Video 2" depending on how you have made the connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Important: Make sure you connect the cable to the TV before turning on the computer as sometimes it may fail to recognize external
 display.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also need to change the screen resolution of your TV using the Display settings in your Control Panel else the picture
 may appear distorted. If after several attempts without success, your 1024 or more may cause some concerns then reduce the resolution to 800x600.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists let us know which type of jack or port are you using to connect the laptop to TV.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
