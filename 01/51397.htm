<h2>            Lockscreen</h2>
                    <p>Once or twice a day, when the computer wakes from sleep or monitor pause, I get a gray full screen with a box that says "C:\ Windows Recycle Bin is corrupt do you want to fix it" with two two buttons (Yes or No) and the yes button is highlighted. My mouse
 pointer is there, but clicking on either button does nothing. The first few times I had to restart the computer to get it to work, then one day I let it set there for awhile and the grey screen went away, and the lock screen was there. It only happens once
 or twice a day, but usually there is something I want to do, before I forget about it, and it is becoming a pain.It does this whether or not there is anything in the recycle bin. Anyone have any suggestions?

<p>The issue that you're experiencing has something to do with the <strong>Recycle Bin</strong>. Since the suggested steps didn't resolve it, and you're still getting the error message on your computer, what you can do next is reset the Recycle Bin. Here's
 what to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Run</strong> the <strong>Command Prompt as Administrator</strong>. To do that, press the
<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard, then click <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the command: <strong>rd /s /q C:\$Recycle.bin</strong>.<br />

<h2>            Slow file sharing over network</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have Windows 7 installed on both my desktop and laptop. (These machines also dual boot XP SP3) The network is via 802.11g wifi. When they are booted into Windows 7, and I attempt to copy a file from one to the other, it is painfully slow! A 50MB file takes
 over 5 minutes! It is faster to upload the file to an internet sharing service and download it on the other machine. I do not think it is a problem with the router or network cards, as when they are booted into XP, they share quickly, with no problems whatsoever.
 I have tried sharing with homegroup and without, the problem persists. Any ideas??</p>

            Turns out it is not service related. BAD DRIVER PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT WITH WIN7. I guess I should not be surprised there, after all of the driver issues with Vista launch. I would have thought MS would have sorted this stuff out. The wireless card in the
 Desktop was an RALINK based draft N card. Worked flawlessly under XP. Driver provided by MS via WIN7 was faulty. Tried every RALINK driver I could find through MS update catalog. No luck. Contacted the vendor, no update from them either.
<div>Removed the card and went with a non-RALINK based draft N card with a driver specifically for WIN7 from the vendor and problem is resolved.</div>

<h2>            Computer problems related to Windows Update.</h2>
                    Yesterday, I selected the following Windows update which was an optional update:<br />
<br />
Windows Live Essential 2011 (KB2434419)<br />
<br />
Since I did this I have had the following problems with my computer:<br />
<br />
1. When I switch on my computer, the first screen that appears which shows the make of my computer, stays for about 3 or 4 minutes rather than a couple of seconds as it used to do.<br />
2. When I am using hotmail, something starts downloading without my permission.&nbsp; Norton stops this as it is malware.&nbsp; This has happened everytime I have opened my hotmail account.<br />
3. The previous time I used my computer, the desktop was black with no icons and no toolbar along the borrom of the screen.&nbsp; The only way I could access any programme was ctrl + alt + delete.<br />
<br />
Basically the performance of my computer has started to deteriorate.<br />
<br />
I have used malwarebytes and norton to scan my computer for problems (on quick scan), but nothing was found.&nbsp; I have contacted norton, but they told me it was a a problem with my computer and I needed to contact microsoft.<br />
<br />
Could these problems be linked to the optional Windows update?&nbsp; How should I resolve these problems?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />
<br />

<p>I'd very much doubt it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application (e.g., Norton AntiVirus v19.x)&nbsp;or security suite&nbsp;(e.g., Norton 360 v5.x)&nbsp;and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription</em> (if&nbsp;any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. Has MBAM <em>ever</em> detected &amp; removed anything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has any <em>other</em> Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            1a.&nbsp; About 4 years ago<br />
b. Vista 32 bit<br />
2a. Norton 360 v 6.4.0.9<br />
b. Yes - when I first installed it about 4 or 5 months ago after advice from this website, it did detect and remove a couple of viruses.&nbsp; Prior to this random adverts kept popping up, but after this, the adverts stopped.<br />
3. Norton -&nbsp; I did have an automatic update installed, but after the update, I was unable to use the internet at all.&nbsp; I had to close norton down completely.&nbsp; They then took over my computer and resolved the problem, but I am unsure if this means I do not have
 the latest version or if the latest version will work on my computer.&nbsp; I have not had any other Mcafee application on my computer.<br />
4. I don't think so.&nbsp; I brought Norton 360 with the computer and installed it straight away.<br />
5. I found all of the updates except (a) kb2761451, (c) kb2736233 and (d) kb2721691<br />
6. I do not have Java installed.<br />
7. No. I have 11,4,402,278 on explorer.&nbsp; Just checked it on Firefox, and the version is 11,5,502,110<br />
8. I have installed firefox, chrome and explorer.&nbsp; I use Firefox mostly.<br />
9. Yes.&nbsp; I had to go through the process of getting windows vista to repair itself following guidance in my first question (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/chkdsk-runs-and-aborts-at-43-on-startup-blue/667c73c3-545f-4e3c-93d2-beb487db2e01)&nbsp;
 This fixed the problem.<br />
10. Yes - there is a registry cleaner which runs about once a week on Norton 360, and I also use registry cleaner on CCleaner.<br />
11. Yes.&nbsp; I have had the same computer throughout.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>1. When (exact date, preferably) does your current Norton subscription expire?</p>

<blockquote>[ANSWER #3] Norton -&nbsp; I did have an automatic update installed, but after the update, I was unable to use the internet at all.&nbsp; I had to close norton down completely.&nbsp; They then took over my computer and resolved the problem,

<p>2a. Does the above mean that Norton 360 v6.x&nbsp;"auto-updated" to the newest version (i.e., Norton 360 v20.x -
<em>yes, the version-number jump is confusing but that's the next version after v6.x</em>) and then your computer could no longer connect to the internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. Assuming a Norton Support tech connected to your computer remotely, did the tech have to remove/uninstall the new version and/or reinstall v6.x again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c. And did all this happen before 13 November 2012 or possibly before 21 September 2012?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is KB2744842, KB2722913 <em>or&nbsp;KB2719177</em> listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I understand that you prefer Firefox but&nbsp;is IE9 working OK&nbsp;when you intentionally&nbsp;choose to use it? [TEST NOW, BEFORE ANSWERING QUESTION - THX]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Speaking of which, can you open IE9 (<em>only!</em>) to this page &amp; successfully install Flash Player v11.5.502.110 (or higher) for Internet Explorer? =&gt;

<span>Google Toolbar<span style="font-style: italic">!</span></span>
<br />
<br />
6. One more =&gt; Do you have backups of ALL the changes Norton Registy Cleaner <em>
and/or CCleaner Registry Cleaner </em>have EVER made to your&nbsp;computer? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: When we've finished this thread, you may wanna get Firefox v17.0.1 installed; cf.

<p>==============================================================<br />
[1] Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here, too. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't), read

<p>2a. I do not know which version auto updated which caused all the problems, but the version I have now is 6.4.0.9.&nbsp; I have just checked and there is an update available, but I am very reluctant to update in case I have the same problems again.</p>
<p>b. I am not sure if the tech had to remove or uninstall v6.x.&nbsp; As I am using 6.4.0.9 so I assume he didid uninstall 6.x.</p>
<p>c. Yes- it happened a few months ago.&nbsp; In addition, after all this happened, the drivers were not connecting my mp3 player and external hard drive.&nbsp; One of my earlier questsion was about this.&nbsp; I am now able to connect my mp3 player, but, even though the
 hard drive connects to my computer, it is still not showing any where in any of the drives.</p>
<p>3. They are all installed.</p>
<p>4. I am replying using IE.&nbsp; IE9 is working fine, though it did take a about 10 minutes before it would work without freezing</p>
<p>5. Flash Player updated when I opened IE.&nbsp; I am now using 11.5.502.110</p>
<p>6. CCleaner - whenever I clear the registry I get asked if I want to save or backup I used to always click yes, but over the last month or 2 I have clicked no - I do not fully understand what any of this meant.&nbsp; When using Norton I do not know if I have&nbsp;
 backups&nbsp; of changes on the Registry Cleaner.&nbsp; When I use this option, I get a message stating no further action is required.&nbsp; I do not really understand what backing up these changes mean.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly. The years of Norton&nbsp;"leftovers"&nbsp;may be&nbsp;causing your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've put together just for you...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You&nbsp;will want to print these instructions for offline reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;IMPORTANT&nbsp;=&gt; DON'T SKIP&nbsp;ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session!&nbsp; If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp;
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. <em>Since there's a remote possibility that&nbsp;a McAfee&nbsp;free-trial may have&nbsp;been preinstalled on the computer when you bought it =&gt;</em>&nbsp;Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; also download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool,
 saving it to your desktop: <a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall
<strong>Norton 360</strong>&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> <em>and</em> any
<strong>Norton Add-ons</strong> via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make certain the Windows Firewall is enabled&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> after rebooting! [Should happen automatically but I want you to check.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em><u>else</u></em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5a. Right-click on the file you saved in #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility, then reboot&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. to&nbsp;run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do a clean install of&nbsp;<strong><em>Norton&nbsp;360 v20.x</em></strong>&nbsp;(using your Product ID, if need be)&nbsp;&amp; reboot;&nbsp;cf.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <em>Do&nbsp;NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons or toolbars (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.</em></strong><em>
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Manually and repeatedly run (Norton) <strong>LiveUpdate</strong> until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Download/run the appropriate scripts&nbsp;from the following Trusted Source (my colleague&nbsp;IE MVP Kai Schätzl):&nbsp;<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt;&nbsp;The scripts are good for IE9, too,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: The file named&nbsp;<strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the&nbsp;scripts below (plus a third script&nbsp;that you&nbsp;will NOT use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then&nbsp;double-click on&nbsp;the&nbsp;file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on&nbsp;the&nbsp;file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM&nbsp;(<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Set
 Program Access and Computer Defaults</span></a>. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11a. Right-click on the following link and SAVE the download to your desktop:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/reg/chromehtml.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/problems/reg/chromehtml.reg</a> [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11b. Double-click on the file you saved in #11a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a> [ignore any DOES NOT APPLY warnings as well as the APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13a. Open Internet Explorer&nbsp;(<em>only!</em>) to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</a>&nbsp;[ignore the title &amp; Symptoms].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13b. <em><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Dismiss/close the Windows Update troubleshooter pop-up!</strong></em> -&nbsp;then...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13c. Ignoring any "Not recommended" or similar warnings, run Fix It 50202 in DEFAULT
<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>.&nbsp;[3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. <em>Reboot one last time</em> then test&nbsp;by running a manual check for updates&nbsp;and see if KB2761451 [4]&nbsp;is offered &amp; will successfully install now; follow all prompts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15. Over the next day or so, restart your computer several times &amp; see if everything's still OK. Also test accessing your Hotmail account (i.e.,
<a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>) via <em>
Internet Explorer </em>(only)&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the functionality of whatever Windows Live applications are installed (e.g., Windows Live Messenger; Windows Live Mail).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16. Then reply to this post with a status report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: Stop using Norton Registry Cleaner as well as CCleaner's Registry Cleaner. See the footnote in my previous reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>====================================================<br />
[1] Tip: You will find that your Windows Live applications and Hotmail (webpage) will only be truly "happy" when Internet Explorer is the default Browser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[3] Full Disclosure: Running the&nbsp;Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode&nbsp;will delete your <strong>
Update History</strong> but <em>not</em> the list of <strong>Installed Updates</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4] Chances are KB2761451 will be superseded (replaced) by a new Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer on Tuesday, 11 December 2012.</p>

<p>You may not want to wait another 2+ weeks, my friend. As long as KB2761451 is not installed (and assuming the second line&nbsp;IE9 Help | About displays
<strong>Update Version: 9.0.10</strong>)...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The computer should NOT be connected to the internet <em>or any local networks</em> (i.e., other computers) in its current state! All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already
 compromised.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Chances are KB2761451 will be superseded (replaced) by&nbsp;new Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer tomorrow (i.e., 11 December 2012). If KB2761451 isn't installed, chances are the new one won't be installed either.</p>

            I've just had another check and I have now managed to find KB2761451 - installed on 15/11/12.&nbsp; Does this affect anything.&nbsp; Sorry I missed it when I looked the first time - there is about 2500 listed updates.

<p><span>Hi cweberestate,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot into Windows in the safe then try the clean boot procedure and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>

<p><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.

 find anything. Am I missing something?

            <p>Hi ThomasStreicher,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting the question. I am sorry to hear that you have an issue accessing programs through start button; I would request to send us additional information as listed below to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li>
<div><span>Which antivirus application are you using?</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><span>Do you face this issue with all programs or particular program?</span></span></div>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may try these methods and check the issue status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Check if you can experience the issue in ‘Safe mode’; if safe mode works fine then set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state to check for software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Keep the computer on a clean boot and check for the issue status. If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem. Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
 After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning
 and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span><br />
Note: </span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Important: </span><span>While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I would request you to reply us with troubleshooting result to assist you further. We’ll be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p>My laptop has lost its wireless connection to HP Officejet Pro K8600. &nbsp;It worked fine from the initial setup until very recently when it dropped out. &nbsp;My PC still works wirelessly with the printer but I can't get anything to print from the laptop, it just
 gets held in a queue. &nbsp;I can't even get it now to show in devices and printers as the default printer. Help?</p>

    <title>using laptop as second monitor with office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            using laptop as second monitor with office 365</h2>
                    <p>Can you use a laptop as a second monitor (with or without a docking station)?&nbsp; Due to space constraints, we often have to move to different parts of the building when visiting MD arrive.&nbsp; Ideally, we could take laptops with us.&nbsp; BUT when we can be at our
 Lenovo ThinkCentre All in One, use the laptops as the second monitor to save space.&nbsp; We need the functionality to use one mouse, keyboard, drag and drop capability, etc. to utilize both screens.&nbsp; (All work is saved to the cloud, no individual hard drive use.)</p>
<p>If this is possible, we will need some detail, as our office manager says no, the laptop would have to be the primary, all typing would have to be done on that keyboard and no single mouse or drag and drop capability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That looks like it came from a server, so the suggestion to contact the system administrator sounds right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, if the host has more than one address you could try forcing use of an alternate one by adding it to your HOSTS file.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could use the Developer Tools, Network Capture tool (F12, Ctrl-Backtab, F5) to confirm this idea.&nbsp; Checking on the address being used would be more difficult, since IE DT NC does not show them,&nbsp;&nbsp; One way that might work is using the Resource Monitor
 for its Network tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise NetMon would be a conventional complete tool for doing this.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Double click on document does not work. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Double click on document does not work.</h2>
                    <p>Double clicking an Excel or Word document opens only the programme not the document. Obviously you can then use 'open' to open the document but that is tedious.
</p>
<p>Can the original functionality be recdovered?</p>

<p>If the disc is damaged or excessively worn, the console may not be able to authorize the disc's signature (which the console uses to ensure the disc is not a copy). You may want to consider a cleaning service, which many used-game retailers have. &nbsp;To troubleshoot
 further, have you tried this with other games?</p>

            Hi,
<br />The crash blamed Nvidia driver. As you have done a clean install of drivers, nothing much we can do except for checking if the Graphics card is faulty.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please run Furmark:
<br /><a href="https://geeks3d.com/furmark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://geeks3d.com/furmark/</a>
<br />
<br />Anything of temps above 80, Artifacts or BSOD would mean the card probably needs replacement.

<br />Step 1 is useless, look at step 2 for their removal tool. Good luck, let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns..

            I did those tests and tried another drive. &nbsp;All the drives are working fine and the computer recognizes them, but the file history function does not connect to the drive, no matter which one I assign. &nbsp;It is not a problem with the computer recognizing
 the drive or the drive itself. &nbsp;The problem is windows 10 will not allow a drive to be assigned to the file history function. &nbsp; Err msg: &nbsp;"File history does not recognize this drive."

            <p>It's been a while since you asked for help, but if you're still facing this problem ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the issue is related to a Lexmark printer (or a Dell-badged Lexmark printer, perhaps the All-in-one 946).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have such a printer?&nbsp; If so, is it working properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to your system shortly before the problem started?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't now have such a printer, did you recently uninstall one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other printers, if any, are currently installed?</p>
