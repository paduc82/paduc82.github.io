            HI PT  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If those don't get it working then look for a Function Key driver which may also be needed.  If you can't find it then report back the PC make and model and I"ll take a look for you.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi PEACHTREESGANSTAR 
<br />
<br />What keys on your keyboard control volume, is that some of the function keys (F1 - F12)
<br />
<br />If so, if you press the Fn key + a function key, does that change your volume&gt;
<br />
<br />Or are those dedicated volume buttons on your keyboard?
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of you PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . ..

<h2>            Sleep Problem after win 10 install</h2>
                    <p>PC 1 - Gateway NV52 Laptop on Win 7</p>
<p>After install of 10, when I hit the sleep button or select sleep from the start button, the monitor goes off but the pc just keeps running the fan and does not turn off. Nothing wakes it up and I have to hold the power key to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC2 - Acer desktop on Win 7</p>
<p>After install of 10, the sleep option is not longer available. I only see logoff and shutdown. In control panel, the settings for sleep mode are greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like many are having sleep problems and I am having real sleep problems trying to solve this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried running the powercfg command to see if it can identify anything that's stopping the machine from going into sleep mode? You'll need to run it on the command line (cmd.exe), with Admin privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open cmd and run: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">powercfg -request<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>Ideally, this is what you want to see:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">C:\Users\username&gt;powercfg -requests<br />
DISPLAY:<br />
None.<br />
<br />
SYSTEM:<br />
None.<br />
<br />
AWAYMODE:<br />
None.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>You could also generate an energy-report, by running "powercfg -energy", but to be honest, I'm not sure how helpful that will be - it just might highlight something, or give you some clues.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>Other than that, I would suggest visiting the computer vendor's support site and updating the drivers for all major components (display, chipset, wireless, BIOS, even audio), since one of these might be conflicting with the power management sleep functions,
 even if it's not detected in powercfg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, for my ASUS X555, I found that my display driver was interfering with Windows sleep management, and a display driver update resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have another machine (old Toshiba Satellite A500 laptop) that I will need to start troubleshooting when I get home, so if I find a solution for that one too, I'll post an update here. It's a rather old laptop though, so I have a feeling Toshiba
 won't even have looked into Win10 driver updates for it yet!</p>

            <p>Those characters don't actually show up as "ú" do they? If so, that's strange. If they really are displayed as "ú", then maybe this is something to do with the character set used by your command line. "chcp" would tell you what your active code page is.
 Mine is 850.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just in case this helps you or anyone else looking at this thread, here's what my problem turned out to be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, when I got home and ran the report, I could see that it was my Microsoft Wireless Mouse and Keyboard combo (the 1000 model) that was conflicting with sleep. Various devices, including the mouse and keyboard, can be configured to "Allow this device
 to wake the computer" (go into Device Manager, right click on the device in question, and click properties, then "Power Management", and you should see a check box for that feature. Disable it, and see if that helps).</p>
<p>In my case, simply moving the USB dongle from the USB slot it was in, to another free USB slot, resolved the issue.</p>
<p>However, I really wanted to use the other slot, so I moved it back, uninstalled the drivers, completely deleting them, and then reinstalled afresh. That has been working fine so far, sleep issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have better luck the "powercfg -energy", and having a read through of the resulting report. The report I got pointed directly to the mouse and keyboard being the problem, however, it explicitly stated that this wouldn't prevent the computer from
 going to sleep. This was not true, obviously!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in some way.</p>

            The fault is the sleep option fails and crashes your computer when woken up. You might discover the virus checker has also been disabled !<br />
You computer's power-key [in the start menu] needs a popup menu with ' Hibernate' 'Shut Down' and 'Restart'.<br />
<br />
1. Click starts &gt; settings &gt; system<br />
<br />
2. Left side menu click &gt; Power and Sleep.<br />
<br />
3. Scroll down click &gt; Additional Power Settings.<br />
<br />
4. Left menu. For each of these Click &gt; 'Choose what the power buttons do' and Click &gt; 'Choose what closing the lid does'. Make these changes [battery and plugged in]:<br />
<br />
When I press the power button ~ Hibernate.<br />
<br />
When I press the sleep button ~ Turn Off the Display.<br />
<br />
When I close the Lid ~ Sleep.<br />
<br />
Now return to 3 above &gt; Additional Power Settings and continue:<br />
<br />
5. Look for 'Plan shown on the battery metre' and a highlighted circle. Yours could be 'Automatic balances or balances[recommended]. If your computer is highlighted [example DELL] use that option.<br />
<br />
6. Adjacent your choice click 'Change Plan Setting'<br />
<br />
7 On next screen click 'Change advanced power settings'<br />
<br />
8. A new menu appears. Move down and click &gt; Power Button &amp; Lid<br />
<br />
9. Go down the menu and make these changes [battery and plugged in];<br />
<br />
Lid close .... change to 'Sleep' for both options.<br />
<br />
Power Button ... change to 'Hibernate' for both options<br />
<br />
Sleep Button ... change to 'Turn Off the display'.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to OK before closing the process.<br />
<br />
Power option key 'sleep' has now been removed and Hibernate installed. <br />
Your computer should no longer crash to a black screen. <br />

The start&gt;power key now uses Hibernate, Shut Down or Restart.

            <p>@BusyBuzz - I guess you are answering @JimNidiffer's problem # 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@JimNidiffer - in regards to problem #1, I think I may have a direct workaround (if not a solution) for the issue affecting your&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Gateway NV52 Laptop on Win 7:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend called me over for help with his HP Pavillion desktop computer, where he was getting exactly the same symptoms.</p>
<p>When I ran powerfg -requests and also powercfg -energy, I was consistently seeing the same "Legacy Kernel Caller" device reported as being the problematic device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To bypass that issue, we ran this:</p>
Powercfg -requestsoverride Driver "Legacy Kernel Caller" System</p>
<p>
</p><p>This disabled all power calls from the device, and provided a quick workaround, but we wanted to find out what the root cause was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since "Legacy Kernel Caller" was a bit generic, and didn't point me towards anything specific, I had a look at the devices he had attached to the system, and at any cards he'd added. After some trial and error of disconnecting and reconnecting devices and
 cards I found it was an old cheapo brand Wireless g expansion card. Since we couldn't find any new Win10 drivers for it, we just uninstalled its driver completely, and Windows detected it at the next start up and installed the default USB drivers, which worked
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen, a large percentage of these power issues are down to incompatible device drivers left behind after an in-place upgrade. In many cases, they might be drivers that have survived several upgrades (e.g. XP to Win7 to Win 10)...&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps you've already resolved the issue yourself long ago, but I hope this will be helpful to someone, in any case :)</p>

<h2>            Canon PowerShot S2 IS&#59; Camera Window wont work on Windows 7</h2>
                    On my old computer I have the relevant software for the Canon PowerShot S2 IS installed and it enabled me to download the photos using the 'camera window' feature.&nbsp; This let me stipulate that I wanted the date taken included in the file name of the photo.&nbsp;
 On my new computer with windows 7 though I can see the camera is connected when I click on 'My computer' but&nbsp; when I use the camera window to download it says that it can not detect the camera.<br />

            <p>Maybe the following info would be useful:<br />
<br />
The following Canon document states that<br />
"CameraWindow is no longer included in ZoomBrowser EX 6.6.0b or later"<br />
<br />
It goes on to say the following:<br />
<br />
"CameraWindow is available on the CD-ROM as a separate module. If necessary, <br />
install CameraWindow from the CD-ROM bundled with the product. Note: The <br />
serial number of your Canon product (Camera, printer...etc.) is required to <br />
download this file."<br />
<br />
Here's how to access that info...go to the following link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_g_series/powershot_s2_is#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_g_series/powershot_s2_is#DriversAndSoftware</a>.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Choose Operating System:" drop window select Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Left click "Software"<br />
<br />
Left click the 'Download' button for "ZoomBrowser EX 6.6.0b Application"<br />
<br />
This will display all the information about the download. <br />
<br />
Also...an update was posted 03-30-11 <br />
<br />
Just a guess...but maybe it would be worth a try to install the update and <br />
then reinstall CameraWindow from&nbsp;the CD that came with the camera.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would just download the photos and rename them myself<br />
<br />
Renaming with the date&nbsp;can be done easily in a batch <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the newly downloaded group and right click the first <br />
thumbnail or&nbsp;filename.<br />
<br />
From the menu ...choose...Rename...<br />
<br />
For the first filename...Type...<br />
<br />
09-08-2011 (10001).jpg<br />
<br />
Press...Enter and the remaining files will be renamed.<br />
<br />

    <title>File Transfer From PC To USB Thumbdrive Using Windows Explorer Has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattcasdorph  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Transfer From PC To USB Thumbdrive Using Windows Explorer Has Problems.</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to transfer folders from my PC (folder on desktop) to my 2TB USB thumbdrive. I have a folder on my desktop that had about 20-30 folders that had anywhere between 1GB to 4GB in each one. Transferring them to the thumbdrive resulted in some
 of the folders on the thumbdrive to be empty.. I thought I heard a long time ago that Windows Explorer was not really reliable for file transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my usb drive transfer has been kinda slow at 10-12mb/s so I went searching online and they said you can speed up the USB transfer rate by going to device manager and selecting the device, going to policy and selecting improve performance, that increased
 the initial data transfer rate to 30-60mb/s but starts slowing down and bottoming out almost acting like its not transferring at all, I'm talking all the way down to 300kb/s slow, not sure if that was accurate and still transferring or bottomed out and not
 transferring, never got an error so I dont know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have much faith getting an answer since it appears Microsoft tends to close threads awful quick when I search this site for answers to different problems, seems like nobody gets much help here but any help anyone can provide me would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi mcasdorph2 
<br />
<br />Where did you purchase that 2TB thumb drive, was that online?
<br />
<br />Unless you paid $800+ for that drive, it is most likely a fake and in reality is an 8GB or 16GB flash drive with a hacked allocation table, this is very common on the Internet . . .
<br />
<br />If that is a fake, it will transfer files at a much reduced rate and when it hits the actual size of the chip in the drive, it will continue like it is copying files, when in actuality it is not copying files . . .

    <title>Open local file path links in Skype for Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin haslien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open local file path links in Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>I have this image sharing tool that capture a screenshot and can upload the screenshot to our local servers and then paste the link to it in my clipboard. What we use this for is communicating with each other through chat, since we are in different offices
 but all have access to that same server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to click on the link, which for example looks like this:</p>
<p>file://SERVER-3/Images/Screenshots/image-11-01-2017.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to send this link to my co-worker through chat, but when I click on the link it gives an error.</p>
<p>"Sorry, we couldn't open the link" or "The web page [link] was not loaded in response to clicking the link because it is either invalid or restricted for security reasons. For more information, contact your system administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the system administrator, I can say that I have not found any way to fix it.</p>
<p>I've Googled a lot and it would seem like it is something one could change through something called "Client policy", or something. I'm not sure.</p>
<p>But that is basically the issue, and I want to know how to unlock this restriction.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, we need to add [ \ ] + [space] + [ \ ] after the file path. For example:<strong>file://SERVER-3/Images/Screenshots/image-11-01-2017\ \</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give it a shot and check the result.</p>

</p><p>Based on my experience, there is no settings to restrict us from opening a file path link in the Skype for Business. I wonder if you share a folder on your own computer, then follow the steps above and copy the path link in the Skype for Business, and check
 if you can open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

            <p>It opens a file path, but it cannot open an image file that I link to.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>path file://SERVER/Images/screenshots</strong>&nbsp;work with the ending //, / /, \\ and \ \.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;<strong>file://SERVER/Images/screenshots/screenshot.png</strong> does not work with any of those.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yeah, you are right, we can only open the file path instead of the file itself in the Skype for Business.

<h2>            Virtools player stop working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm playing a pc game.</p>
<p>Yesterday I could play without issues but today, when I was trying to enter the game, it said to me that ``Virtools Player stop working´´. I tried to fix the error but I couldn't. It says me that it doesn't have any solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 prolems in lenovo y570</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
I updated my operating system to Window 10 from Windows 7 &nbsp;and I am having a ton of problems. I lost a lot of my Lenovo interface options as well...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
One of the worst and most annoying problems is that randomly, for half a second, the computer&nbsp;stops and thinks which freezes up my typing. If I am writing&nbsp;something, when it wants to freeze&nbsp;it prevents me from typing that letter. It basically overrides&nbsp;my keyboard
 well it does that freezing for half a second. Also, when I have a drop down menu it will close when this happens or when I right click, the menu will disappear&nbsp;when this "glitch" happens. One of the biggest clues I found is under the task manager. In the Processes
 tab, when this "glitch" happens "Windows Problem Reporting" pops up for a half second. I am not sure if that is causing this problem or if something goes wrong and "Windows Problem Reporting" pops up because&nbsp;of something else?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Is there a way to check and see what these "Windows Problem Reporting" are?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Also, I can not control my GPU switch&nbsp;anymore. Before the update I could change my GPU from Intel HD card to Geforce 555M. Now I have no idea what GPU I am using and how to go back and forth. Is there a fix for this?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Since all these problems occurred&nbsp;with the Windows 10 update, would it be better for me to go back to Windows 7 and wait to see if Lenovo and Windows ever going to create drives for Lenovo Y570? Is it advisable&nbsp;to switch back W7 and switch back to W10 later?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suugest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (<strong>DISM</strong>) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe), PEimg, and Intlcfg tools.
 DISM consolidates the functionality found in those three tools, as well as delivers new functionality to improve the experience of offline servicing.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to Run <strong>DISM</strong> Commands:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press <strong>Windows + x</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: Update graphics driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Press <strong>Windows key + X key</strong> when you are at desktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2) Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3) Expand <strong>Display Adapter</strong>.</span></p>

<strong>Update driver software</strong>.</span></p>

            <p>If you go to lenovo.com and search for W570indows 10 compatibility, you'll find a chart that shows that the Y570 Ideapad is not supported as a Windows 10 platform.&nbsp; Lenovo, in their typical short-sighted vision, has not spent much time or effort to ensure
 that their non-ThinkPad legacy users can migrate to Microsoft's latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Y570, and after numerous attempts to get Windows 10 working with acceptable performance, I finally hit the same problem you have described.&nbsp; My workaround was to restore my computer to a previous Windows 7 state by restoring a recent system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this experience, I've decided that I am "done" with Lenovo.&nbsp; My next laptop will be anything but a Lenovo.</p>

            <p>So Lenovo Y570 does not work with Windows 10 at all? Has someone tried to make a clean install + drivers from part manufacturers only where needed. This should work in theory. The multimedia keys will not work, they need drivers but the graphics card switch
 and the wi-fi switch should work. It does not make sense if they don't. I really want to get windows 10 and my plan was to make a clean install and run a driver scanning program or just install drivers from device manager. Do you think this will work??? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 installed fine on my Lenovo Y570 without any critical issues.&nbsp; I have been using it for 10 days now with only a few hiccups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other articles on Google and Lenovo, users complain that there are known issues when RapidBoot is installed and operational.&nbsp; These articles seem to indicate that you have to un-install RapidBoot completely including the drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always install my own OS and did not have RapidBoot installed on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only driver I had to install was the Jmicron Card Reader using the W8 x64 version...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem I have is that the computer will not goto sleep.&nbsp; This is also a reported issues with numerous W10 installations.&nbsp; Folk talk about issues with display drivers and/or when sharing is enabled.&nbsp; I've not resolved this issue to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem is related to SHREW VPN and DNS not correct when the tunnel is established; its still the original Ethernet LAN rather than that of the remote work location.&nbsp; IP routes correctly.&nbsp; Luckilly, I just RDP into my work computer on my desktop
 to work w/o issue.&nbsp; Folk talk about scripts to alter DNS settings.&nbsp; I'd like a true fix eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DNS issue does break Skype For Business however and I cannot contact business associates using the local computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have installed Win 10 on my Y570 aswell.. But I replaced the internal 30GB SSD with a 128GB one, and I installed the system on the SSD, using the HDD just for data. It was running great, without any problems, I can even control screen brightness and Wifi/BT
 from built-in windows management.</p>
<p>However after the November upgrade, the system is slowing down, it has problems multitasking, and hangs from time to time as if it didn't have enough memory, but I am &nbsp;not even hitting 80%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was from an upgrade, so I guess I will give it a try and do clean install to see if it helps.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will, not ready to replace my laptop yet.</p>

            W10 upgrade (12/01/2015) &nbsp;went surprisingly well for&nbsp; me too.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried &amp; failed to&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;back in August&nbsp;but had to roll back toW7.&nbsp; This time around my problems/conflicts seem minuscule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean Device Manager &amp; 50 second start-up with a 500 GB hybrid&nbsp;HD.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One Touch Theater/Fan Control buttons&nbsp;&amp; intel wireless display&nbsp;are inop but those aren't&nbsp;deal breakers for me.&nbsp; I was not expecting to be so pleased.&nbsp; Me with W10, whood-a -thunk?&nbsp; Now if I had just bought the 1080 display instead of this crappy ol' 768.&nbsp;
 Oh well,&nbsp; never too&nbsp;happy too long!

            I had this same experience.&nbsp; I've installed and uninstalled Windows 10 three times before this, and each time my Y570 had severe performance problems.&nbsp; The November update seems to have fixed those problems.&nbsp; I'm keeping a system image backup of my Windows
 7 configuration, just in case I need it after the 30 day period expires and Microsoft deletes my old Windows 7 local files (Windows.old)

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">We need to improve low throughput (data download from one server to another server) and hope this can be achieved by using Jumbo Frames or increasing the TCP Window Size.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I had read many articles and I am confused how to improve TCP Stack in Windows Server 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">My understanding is that both sender and receiver TCP windows size needs to be adjusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">But in many articles shows older Windows OS configuration and I found only related to Windows Server 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Based on the available info,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Manually I have edited the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">size and given maximum allowed value and added windows scale to&nbsp;</span>maximum<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;value in both the machine. During Synchronization both agreed
 to use windows scale 14.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">D</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">uring data backup transfer I noticed in wire shark that TCP window size is increased from 64K to 1Mb</span></p>
<p><span>But&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;the communication speed between host A and host B during data backup is not going beyond 5-6 Mbps. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Is there any way to improve throughput speed by changing TCP windows stack?</span></p>
<p>Can you please provide any reference link on configuration part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Timesplitters running on Cryengine 3? That would be interesting but Cryengine 3 and Frostbite 2 are too strong for the consoles lol. A next Gen would be nice. Though Timesplitters would be epic on the PC.</p>

            Hi RobertoTuzii ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />Could you please let me know if your laptop's camera works with other applications?
<br />Check if the camera is selected in Skpe
<br />In Skype Setting&gt; Video &amp; audio&gt; Check in the drop-down list if the camera appears.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34863/how-do-i-change-audio-and-video-settings-in-skype-on-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34863/how-do...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-video-device-options-in-skype-for-business-d09017c0-deba-4f6c-a122-9eca6604f50c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-vi...</a>
<br />
<br />2. I recommend accessing Skype via Web and checking if the camera can not be activated from the Web.
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a>
<br />
<br />3. In the Device Manager, update the camera drivers.
<br />
<br />Press the Win key + X and select Device Manager from the menu.
<br />Now click Imaging devices where you should find your webcam listed.
<br />Next, right-click the webcam and select the Update Driver Software option from the context menu.
<br />An Update Driver Software window opens from which you can select Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />
<br />
<br />I wish I had helped you. If you have any doubt do not hesitate to ask.
<br />Best regards       
        </p>

<p><strong>Ciao Lucia,</strong></p>
<p><strong>thanks for your help, but my problem is still not solved, it looks like the amera is up to date, with skype and windovs, but when I have tried to access camera from the web, skype doesn't seem to recognise my camera. Don't know. Is there any chance
 for you to do remote access (I have team viewer if can help) and checking this holy camera of mine ? Looking forward to speeking to you again. Grazie.</strong></p>

            Unfortunately I can not do remote session with you. But I will try to help you in this way all that is within my reach.
<br />
<br />I recommend you check your antivirus, they often block Skype access to the camera, I send you a sample photo.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f971b445-04ca-4063-9087-615da97457dd?upload=true" />

            <p>I faced the same issue trying to install CodeWriter app from Store. And the following worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open this folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\<strong>{username}</strong>\AppData\Local\Packages</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: AppData is a hidden folder. To access the path, you may type it directly in the File Explorer address bar. Replace {username} with the actual user account folder name.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rename the folder "Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe" to "Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe-OLD"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logoff and login back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start PowerShell (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">as Administrator</span>) and execute the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(It didn't immediately work after restarting Windows.. but it worked after some time. May be something to do with Microsoft account verification.)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home 64-bit - is 40GB partition enough...</h2>
                    <p>to install and have enough space remaining (if I never download updates) to install/use applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Want to dual-boot with Macbook Pro retina with only 128GB SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously going with the 256GB would have been better, but is it still possible to dual-boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Win 7 64-bit requires 20GB disc space, one would think another &lt;= 20GB would be available, but searching seems to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could I truly expect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Installing Windows 7 on computer with that amount of storage, you have to think about a combination of things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What apps you will be using?</p>
<p>Your future needs, meaning, you have to consider accumulation of data, System Updates, applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you Windows 7 has a bare minimum support of 16 to 20 GBs, that's dependent on factors such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Storing data might be done on a network drive or external storage device.</p>
<p>- You use just the bare essential applications such as Office productivity suite, web browsing and email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, if you plan to setup a boot camp partition with Windows, you are likely using it for a few specific apps that are not available for OS X, it would not be intended to be your default OS unless that is your intention.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all these things can factor in how much you allocate to the Boot Camp partition. The industry always says, never go with Microsoft's bare minimum, so doubling the amount to 40 GBs would be bare recommended just for running the essential apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question, which OS will you been in most of the time?</p>
<p>If you are mostly in Windows, then, it would be recommended to give Windows more. Its not strange to have a Mac just for running Windows. Also, OS X is&nbsp;more flexible, you could give Windows the lions share of SSD and setup OS X to run from an external formatted
 HFS drive in addition to OS X apps. Or you could just run your apps and store content you create in OS X on the external drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could split it between the two OS's 64 for OS X and 64 for Windows. I use a Dell 760 at work, 74 GBs of storage. I have about 10 GBs left out of it, then again, I have a lot of stuff I don't need like media files on it which I can delete. The actual
 amount I would use if I plan to clean up and delete old files would be about 50 GBs of data, inclusive of OS, apps and data.

<h2>            Primary win10 pro boot drive ultra ata crc error count on every boot.</h2>
                    <p>Gigabyte ga-990fxa-ud5 main board primary boot drive seagate 3tb 3g connected on amd sata controller and second drive with same make and size on second port of six.</p>
<p>Both the amd and marvell sata controllers are set for ahci and scsi, not raid or ide mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the beta testing of win 10 it was not possible to install the amd sata drivers, only a microsoft generic driver.</p>
<p>After the public release on the 29th of july, I was able to install the amd drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But now after login, there is a short screen flicker of about 4 seconds as if something is refreshing or trying to connect.</p>
<p>After installing hard disk sentinel &nbsp;and checking the drive, it reports that on each boot, there</p>
<p>is an error, ultra ata crc error count that goes up on every boot.</p>
<p>I do not know if this is a drive issue, controler issue, or a driver issue.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the amd &nbsp;sata driver from device manager, but it just gets reloaded after reboot.</p>
<p>Another thing I have seen is that the drives connected on the marvell controller are listed as scsi, but not the amd connected drives.</p>
<p>I have changed out the sata cable, switched it with the other drive on the amd controller but the results are the same.</p>
<p>The second drive on the amd sata does not have an issue.</p>
<p>Seagate does not have a drive firmware update, but I do see that the two drives that are fine have a firmware version of cc27 where the problem drive is only cc25. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Replacing the drive is the next option but all other parameters of the drive are fine</p>
<p>with no issues and kind of believe this is win10 related.</p>

            <p>Next step is to put a drive on the primary AMD controller to test but from what I have done so far&nbsp;</p>
<p>my gut instinct says this is a driver issue.</p>
<p>The reason in this is that on my 8 year old pc running win10 pro &nbsp;works fine on the nvidia &nbsp;sata&nbsp;</p>
<p>controller and that pc had the driver installed because it was an upgrade.</p>
<p>The pc with the hd issues has had a problem with the AMD chipset &nbsp; from the start and only wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>install a generic Microsoft driver.</p>

            <p>This issue has not been resolved as of yet and not to happy with the one answer I got,</p>
<p>After doing all the steps I listed &nbsp;in the other post on this topic I decided to run &nbsp;linux&nbsp;</p>
<p>from a dvd and see what errors the operating system, drive or drive controllers where&nbsp;</p>
<p>having.</p>
<p>When trying to access any of the physical hard drives I received a message;</p>
<p>error excited; &nbsp; with non -zero exit &nbsp; &nbsp;; status 14: windows is hibernated, refused to mount,</p>
<p>faild to mount/dev/sda4; operation not permitted, &nbsp;ntfs partition is is unsafe state, resume</p>
<p>and shutdown fully( no hibernation or fast restart or mount in read only, ro mount option</p>
<p>read only.</p>
<p>Now hibernate and fast boot are turned of in all power settings set in control panel as well
</p>
<p>as most &nbsp;other power management settings yet is seems win 10 will not give up the
</p>
<p>I could not figure why the only drive having disconnects from the host ( operating system)
</p>
<p>had this issue.</p>
<p>Now the inability to shut the pc down is also back, using the &nbsp;win key and x option sign out or</p>
<p>shut down or using the &nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
shutdown /s /t 0</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; command has the &nbsp;same hang issue.</p>
<p>I also placed the drive in a hard drive enclosure, connected through a usb , the drive</p>
<p>could not initialize and got multiple error messages about drive failure error 128. &nbsp;but it is in use&nbsp;</p>
<p>as I am typing this.</p>
<p>I have almost the same settings on the other win10 pc configured.</p>
<p>I do not know but win10 now has a recovery partition in the start of the drive and at the end of it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>do not think this is normal.</p>

<h2>            unable to search in the address bar - error message advises connectivity problems</h2>
                    <p>When I try to search for anything in the address bar I get the following message</p>
<p>
</p><div>This page can’t be displayed</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the web address <span>
http://bbc </span>is correct.</li><li>Look for the page with your search engine.</li><li>Refresh the page in a few minutes.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Check that all network cables are plugged in.</li><li>Verify that airplane mode is turned off.</li><li>Make sure your wireless switch is turned on.</li><li>See if you can connect to mobile broadband.</li><li>Restart your router.</li></ul>
</div>

<p>
</p><p>If I search from inside a webpage it is fine and I used to be able to search using the address bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the add-ons and ticked the box in there and I also looked in all the places I could find which I could tick to say search in address bar.&nbsp; I noticed that when I went into one of the options the option for searching from the address bar was
 ticked but the actual option was in grey rather than black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been into lots of things looking for things to tick but I am not sure which ones now.&nbsp; I went into internet options and administration tools and looked in those at all the options that could be ticked under all those buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are definitely no connections problems.&nbsp; If I try running the trouble shooter it just comes up saying I have typed the address in wrong but it used to search on just a word or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> super guerrier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cadeaux par Email</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>J'ai vu sur plusieurs sites spécialisé en Jeux vidéo que Microsoft offrez a leur plus fidèles des cadeaux concernant la Xbox One (Code Killer instinct, jeux, console xbox one...).</p>
<p>J'ai également vu que sur plein de forums, beaucoup de personnes ont reçu des cadeaux. Et même un ami a eu la surprise de recevoir un Mail qui indiquez qu'il a remportez un XBOX ONE offerte. Et cette personne a 7 ans de XBOX LIVE et 9 700 GS environ.</p>
<p>Moi qui est un heureux fidèle de Microsoft, + de 8 ans de XBOX live, ayant 212 474 de GamerScore et ayant fait de nombreux achat via le market place... et je vois que beaucoup de joueurs recoivent des cadeaux, alors que certains de dépasse pas les 10 000
 points GS.</p>
<p>Malgrès que sa soit une loterie, je me sens tout de même frustré car j'estime qu'il y a une certaine forme d'injustice via ma fidélité.</p>

<p>Merci de me répondre</p>
<p>Cordialement</p>

            Bon pour commencer nous sommes pas des membres officielle mais des gamer tout comme toi, à part qu'on a le statut "ambassadeur" nous aidons juste les membres comme toi et essayons de répondre le mieux possible au questions. En ce qui concerne l'attribution
 de ces fameux cadeaux, nous n'avons aucune idée de la méthode d'attribution ou autre ,ce n'est pas nous qui décidons qui a quoi,même certain d'entre nous en on reçus et d'autre pas. Donc il nous ai impossible de dire si oui ou non tu vas recevoir quelque chose
 ou pas. Je ne peut que te recommander d'être patient et ton tour viendra ou pas ;)

<p>bonjour, moi je suis Français et j'ai souvent des cadeaux donc on nous oublie pas non plus, nous sommes juste beaucoup moins nombreux (utilisateur xbox) que les américains, donc en conséquence il y a moins de GT Fr sélectionnés dans les 48 millions de membres
 XBL.</p>
<p>Pour infos je fais partis du programme de fidelité VIP depuis 2ans et j'ai le statut "master", je fais aussi tout les beta test de la 360 depuis 2005. peut être que cela rentre en compte dans leur sélection ?</p>
<p>par contre j'ai reçu sur ma 360 le message comme quoi on m'offrait Killer instinct et que je devais suivre l'adresse lié à mon compte xbox pour valider le cadeau et je n'ai pas d'email de microsoft. Je voulais savoir si cela était normale ?</p>

<p>Hi, last sunday many channels changed its frequency in Spain.</p>

<p>I had to configure again my USB Tuner.</p>

<p>Now, I can't see TV show info in many channels, only in the ones that have not changed frequency (but they announce that they will disappear soon)</p>

<p>Excuse my English</p>

            <p>Hey there Long Drong!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the missing channels. The best way to report missing channels is to report them on the Xbox One itself. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the menu button on your Xbox One controller and select Settings.</li>
<li>From the Setting menu, select TV &amp; OneGuide.</li>
<li>From here, select Troubleshooting and 'Report a OneGuide problem'.</li>
<li>In the drop down menu, select Missing channel and follow the steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will reach the proper folks directly!&nbsp;</p>

<p>What exact ACER Aspire One model ? They have used this name convention on numerous variations since 2008.</p>
<p>Generally BIOS is accessed by holding the <em>Delete </em>key while booting into Windows, but if you user manual says F2
</p>
<p>it looks like they do things differently (as laptop mfg's sometimes do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I think you may be more successful posting on the ACER forums, but ...<br />
Note that unless your machine has a dedicated graphics card it has no <em>VRAM</em>. Dedicated video RAM is only available on dedicated graphics cards. Integrated graphics processors use the
<em>system RAM</em>. </p>
<p>If your machine does have a dedicated grahpics card you cannot increase the VRAM in any case. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of laptops these days don't have an option in BIOS to increase the amount of system RAM that gets allocated to graphics.
</p>
The main reason they don't have an option to increase the amount of system RAM reserved for graphics processing is that even
<p>if the graphics processor and cpu were able to actually process the extra data over the amount that is reserved/dedicated for graphics,
</p>
<p>they can still access and use any available RAM that has not been 'dedicated' to graphics.</p>
<p>

<h2>            EMAIL Attachments</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Windows 10, I cannot open or attach any documents. I was able to do this fine with Windows 8.1 and now I cannot even work from home and send documents!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I use outlook for work and when I try to attach a document I see a box try and pop up for less than a second and then nothing.... no error message... nothing. I have no problem opening attachments that are already in the email, but I cannot add
 attachments in outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other account which I have not used in a very long while is aol.com and it is the only email account that lets me attach documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is both email accounts I have that use outlook. I have one for school and one for work. HELP ME!!!! this is frustrating and none of the other posts answer this questions. I have deleted browser history and&nbsp;checked settings and need advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>
