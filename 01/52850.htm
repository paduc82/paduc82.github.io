<h2>            How to recover the disk partition deleted with command clean</h2>
                    <p>I was using the microsoft media tool to create an usb installer of win10. And when asked to select the volume for the system, I accidentally formatted and deleted the primary volume(where I used to install the system), and was noticed with an error code:
 0x8004240f that it couldn't create a new partition, unfortunately, I then activated the diskpart command window, and using the clean command, so now I only have one partition on the disk(although the data is not lost), so I was wondering that how can I recover
 the partition since now there is no partition list and no system installed at all. And I really appreciate your help.</p>

            I am afraid to be the bearer of bad news, but there is unfortunately no undoing this. You will have to restore from a backup if you have one.

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            If you only ran Clean command you can undelete the partition, but you said the Media Creation Tool had formatted it so that is not recoverable.  <a href="http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/partition-recovery-wizard/partition-recovery-wizard.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/partition...</a>

<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:

<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes.

<h2>            Halo MCC Achievements still broken</h2>
                    
<div>On release I held back playing Halo MCC after realising the broken achievements issue, more than a week on and many those achievements I unlocked on release day have yet to unlock, but some of them have? the 4 remaining chieves from release day say 'Done!
 Unlocking' and have done all week. I've had issues of randomnly in the middle of play achievemetns suddenly becoming ridiculously delayed or not unlocking at all and this has really ruined a smalll but sweet part of the experience for me and my friend, both
 halo fans and achievement hunters.</div>

<div>Achievements still buggered for me, missing Pillar of Autumn completion chieve, even though i have various other ones for that level including beating it on par time. I'm missing the 3 co-op difficulty achievements, I'm missing the achievement for beating
 the Gravemind level on halo 2 AND for some reason lacking the achievement for all terminals and toys, even though I have each of the individual achievements. We're also lacking the achievements for beating halo 2's campaign on the various difficulties, even
 though we've beaten the legendary campaign playlist.</div>

<div>Seriously, why is the Xbox One achievement system so broken?</div>

<p>Hey Readytk! </p>
<p>Sorry your achievements aren't working correctly. Looks to be a fairly common right now especially with Halo MCC. There is a client side content update scheduled to come out today. I would apply that and see if it resolves your issue. Also I suggest waiting
 it out a bit. If it's still locked but done it knows you completed it. They just need to finish patching so you get it.

<h2>            After Windows 10 version 1511 Update, MSVCP110.dll &#38; MSVCP110.dll are missing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows update of 1511 (x64 KB3103688) on 26-11-2015,&nbsp;MSVCP110.dll &amp; MSVCP110.dll are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many programs relying on them could NOT run including MSSQL, VS2012, AVG, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could see them under "C:\Windows\System32". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I uninstall VC++ 2012 redistribute and then reinstall both "vcredist_x64" &amp; "vcredist_x86",</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the problem sustains!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update includes many programs and I dare not to do&nbsp;"Go back to an earlier build"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>

            <p>No way to solve the problem with regsvr32: but nonetheless I found a solution that I post here for users with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like last Windows update removed the 32 bit version of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MSVCP110.dll and MSVCP110.dll from the folder windows\SySWOW64.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you need to do is just to find a working copy of these dll (for example from a PC with an older Windows version or here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/o839x721zjdv6jp/DLL.rar) and copy them in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">windows\SySWOW64.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I really hope though that Microsoft will correct this bug soon.</span></p>

            Microsoft's two support desk phone numbers are 800-642-7676 and 877-696-7786.&nbsp; I have verified both numbers thru Microsoft's online chat AND have used both numbers over the last 4 years.&nbsp; Do not google it or believe any other "information" - just contact
 MS yourself online if you're still not sure.&nbsp; Microsoft offers a yearly renewable helpdesk support called "Assure Software Support Plan" that runs approximately $150 or less (depending on how long you've been a member and if you use their auto-payment plan.&nbsp;
 Mine started in 2014 for $149 and has since dropped to $134 due to auto-pay.)&nbsp; You can also pay a one time fee for a single problem.&nbsp; I believe they also have a free hotline but it's probably hard to get thru and has a very long wait for service.&nbsp; I really

<p><span><span>Hello Lorenz Cipher,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should try to run a Chkdsk on your computer to check if there are bad sectors on the hard disk.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the DVD drive, and then restart your computer from the DVD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note:
<span>&nbsp;</span>when you receive the prompt Press any Key to boot from the CD or DVD, press any key on the keyboard to restart your computer by using the Windows Vista DVD.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select your language setting, and then click Next.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Select Repair your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Select the Windows Vista installation to be repaired, and then click Next.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Under System Recovery Options, select command prompt and type:
<br />
chkdsk [drive:] [/p] | [/r]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>[drive:] Specifies the drive to check.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>/p Check even if the drive is not flagged dirty, bad.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>/r Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information (implies /p).</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>Disclaimer:</span></em></strong><span> Performing this task could cause loss of data on your
 computer. It is recommended that you back up all the data and files prior to performing this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
You should also check if all the physical connections for your hard disk are made correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try to run Memory diagnostic on your computer from the Windows Recovery Environment. Follow the same steps as above to access Recovery options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From the recovery options select Memory diagnostic.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At this screen you would then click on the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool option. This will present you with a screen asking if you want to restart
 and run the tool now or on the next restart of the computer, select the first option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also disconnect any external devices connected to your computer and continue with the installation.</span></span></p>

                    My computer running Windows 10 suddenly seemed to have no connection to the speakers in my computer and the drivers were MIA. &nbsp;Decided to run a system restore to see if that would fix and itâ€™s been running for 8 hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;I need to use the computer. &nbsp;What
 do i do?

    <title>Outlook opens but freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amber924  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook opens but freezes</h2>
                    I've used outlook for over a year now on my laptop and it has worked fine.&nbsp; Two days ago I went to open outlook and it opens fine seems to load everything and then it freezes.&nbsp; I can't get my cursor to appear in the outlook window (it appears to be behind
 the window so when I go outside the outlook window it appears).&nbsp; I can run all my other programs fine but I just can't seem to get outlook to work.&nbsp; It doesn't come up with any error message and it doesn't run in safe mode either.&nbsp; I've tried repairing it
 through the program feature and that didn't work.&nbsp; I'd really like to find a way to fix this without reinstalling it as the things saved in my out look pertain to my everyday life and business.&nbsp; I've done everything I know and am at my wits end.&nbsp; I am operating
 with Vista.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help!<br />

            amber924, test this in another profile, follow these steps to create a new user profile:
<p>Follow these steps to create a new account we can test:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> button, clicking
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span><span>, clicking
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">User Accounts and Family Safety</span><span>, and then clicking
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">User Accounts</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Manage another account</span><span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Create a new account</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Type the name you want to give the user account,
</span><span>choose account type as
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Computer Administrator</span><span>, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Create Account</span><span>.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Log off and log on with the new account.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Test Outlook</span></li></ol>
<p>(To remove the test profile follow the above steps and choose to remove the account from User Accounts).<br />
<br />
If your outlook works in this new profile we will need to move your data into it, for this see:&nbsp;<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/769495bf-035c-4764-a538-c9b05c22001e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix a corrupted user profile</a>.</p>
<p><br />
Either way I recommend you locate your outlook saved data and back it up, this is important incase you do need to reinstall it. You will need to locate your
<strong>.PST</strong> folder, see <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/results.aspx?qu=backup+outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that your Surface device is automatically adjusting the brightness even if you disabled the option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you check the Display setting in the power plan options. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Power Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Change plan settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Display </strong>&gt; <strong>Enable adaptive brightness </strong>(for both On battery and Plugged in).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Power Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Change plan settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Display &gt; Intel Graphics Power Plan &gt; </strong>set to<strong> Maximum Performance
</strong>(for both On battery and Plugged in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the suggested troubleshooting steps.</p>

<p>My computers did update windows 10 and one of them since starts with a new User account I don't know any password for: defaultuser1.</p>
<p>Nothing works, it doesn't bring anything to type:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Window+x or or S or F4 (like I've seen on various help website)</p>
<p>Neither does CTRL+ALt+Delete works.</p>
<p>Nor restart : no window open to help me change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found website explaining how to use a password reset disk, but the option is not opening on my surface tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Connectivity Problems in Windows 10</h2>
                    After I attempted to upgrade my computer to Windows 10 it could locate the Wi-Fi connections from my router but despite the correct password would not connect to the internet. Interestingly it would load the intro ages to many sites Drudge Report, Fox
 Sports non of teh links could be downloaded . I have WebRoot as my antivirus solution and use Net Nanny as a family filter. I have attempted to turn off the winows firewall so it would not compete, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers. My final solution was
 to unload windows 10 and revert to older operating system. Does anyone have a solution?

<h3> ralphproud  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows live mail - search by date</h2>
                    One more implementation flaw in Windows Live Mail - when searching for messages
<strong><u>before</u></strong> a cutoff date (as the only search criterion), the results include messages dated
<strong><u>after</u></strong> the cutoff.&nbsp; I have not tried multiple dates to determine if there is a pattern to this failure.&nbsp; Superficial observation - the search is acting almost like a search for messages
<strong><u>after</u></strong> the date rather than <strong><u>before</u></strong> the date.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to cull my messages based on date and this flaw has frustrated that activity.

<p><br />
It hasn't been fixed in any of the 53 builds since then.</p>
<p>You may be able to achieve what you want by selecting <em>Message list </em>&gt; <em>
One-line view </em>on the <em>View </em>tab, then sorting by <em>Date</em>. Use the

<p><span><span>When exactly did the system froze, is it while installing or running the program?<br />
Was the installation successful?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Syncback Free is not listed in Windows7 compatibility list, here is the link to check compatibility:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;You can try uninstalling the software and try installing again and check if the system freezes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use an inbuilt backup feature in windows7, refer this link:</span></span></p>

It doesn't actually Rotate the video but it has vertical flip<br />

    <title>So many frustrations, why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            So many frustrations, why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I know there are a hundred of these posts. But I am losing my mind with all the problems I have with my xbox one.<br />
<br />
1. Opening friends list is a last resort, please god dont make me do it, feature. Want to add someone to a party while in a game? 20-30 seconds of an opaque black loading screen just to load the list of friends. Every action takes 5 seconds or so to respond.
 Slow as hell. Going to the friends list is the one thing I try at all costs to avoid with xbox one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
2. Xbox on... We all know how much of a pain it is to get this to work</p>
<p><br />
3. TV fails to work once a week requiring a hard reset. Suddenly the TV app goes black and just shows the TV icon in the center. If I try to restart it, after about a minute it reports that something went wrong and to try again. After calling MS, only resolution
 is to unplug the xbox and reboot. Really?</p>
<p><br />
4. Bought a game online, wasnt available to play when I got home 8 hours later. Hell, I couldn't even find the link to download, install, or play it. I went to my games, wasnt there. So I click store, and for whatever reason it goes straight to Call of Duty
 DLC. If I back out, it goes back to my games. If I try to open store again, straight to call of duty. No way to see the actual store. I am sure a hard reset fixed this, but I gave up and haven't gone back to check. Eventually the game just popped up out of
 no where with "ready to install". Glad the game was ready for me when I got home..<br />
<br />
5. Everything is just slow. Pin something? Won't be there for a few minutes. Go to friends list, 40 seconds. Open Settings? 30 seconds. Join a party and start talking in your party? 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Come on now... Why is it when I talk to my friends who have an xbox one we are always spending our game talk time complaining about what doesnt work on xbox? When I talk to my PS4 friends, they are always talking about playing games. Not fighting menus, not
 broken features, just playing games.<br />
<br />
You are making it hard to be a Microsoft fanboy :(</p>

<p>Believe me, I find it hard to believe as well. Getting a simple party together is a nightmare. And half the time that doesn't even work right. One of our friends can't get his voice to work in party chat (yes, he is turning it on), but it works fine in game
 chat. Got to love when you go to click enable voice chat on, but the interface lags, loads more in, and instead you click invite more friends. You then have to enjoy sitting at a loading black overlay for 30 seconds while the game goes on without you.<br />
<br />
It seems like they tried to throw every feature possible into this, but hardly any of them were ready for prime time.<br />
<br />
I hate complaining about everything so much. We just want to enjoy the thing, but its constant problems. I don't know anyone else with the TV app problem, but Microsoft sure had a fix ready for me the second I explained my problem so I am not the first one
 to have issues with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am an early adopter. I know new products will have its issues. But lets be honest, there are way more problems than expected. I agree that one day, whenever everything is fixed, the console will be amazing. Never with any console (and I own pretty much
 every one that comes out), have there been so many problems with all of the core features. I see microsoft adopted the new video game release tactic of, push it out the door and fix it months down the road.</p>

<p>I had the cable box issues too...make sure you cable box isnt too old or it has a hard time reading it...plus i manually put in my cable box number in myself and now everything works smooth and i can use the voice commands..before i let the xbox automatically
 find it doing the setup and it had the wrong box number inn soo all i got was the picture with no voice commands and it had a hard time showing the picture on screen right away when i selected the TV app....also check your router connections i had my router
 connected but my multiplayer connection wouldnt go through until i rested my router again...now i have an established multiplayer connection under settings....The more complex these new consoles get the more problems are gonna surface...eventually they ill
 be sorted out but doesn't hurt to limit some yourself.</p>

<p>Yep his telling the truth. I do agree MS should of had some of these problems worked out before people got them home and setup/ But we do need to remember it is a new game system so its gonna take a few updates to get things running smooth..</p>
<p>I will be honest here and say I play more on my PS4 and xbox360 then my new xbox1.And its pretty sad to cause I always defend Microsoft but a lot of the people on here yelling about the new xbox have every right to be upset.</p>

    <title>Application Installer Error after Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajbennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application Installer Error after Windows 10</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10 approx 2 months ago. Today I tried to use OCR on my Brother MFC-J430w all in one. The OCR drivers did not work. I went to the Brother site and followed the instructions to uninstall the Brother all in one software/drivers. Then I
 downloaded the updated Brother software/drivers. The setup.exe will not work (I have downloaded it 5 times). When I click on the setup, I get an error message that says: Cannot start Application Installer. [,,,,, /10x0009. I called Brother and Brother says
 that it is a Windows 10 upgrade problem. I called Microsoft and was told that this is a Brother problem. I don't understand why it is a Brother program when it is an Application Error. --- Also, the printer and the scanner both worked after the Windows 10
 upgrade. This was the first day I tried to use the OCR. NOW, the printer works for the scanner and the OCR don't work. Please, please help.

            Hi, ClaudiaMaynard
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isnâ€™t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hello Claudia,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />When you cannot connect to Windows, there are two different situations.
<br />
<br />1- If your connexion account is a Microsoft account, you can reset the password on login screen. 
<br />
<br />2- If your only connexion account is a local account, the easiest solution is to reset the PC with option remove everything, necessary option when you have no password.
<br />
<br /> You can get to reset by restarting your PC from the sign-in screen. Press the Windows logo key  +L to get to the sign-in screen, and then hold the Shift key while you select Power  &gt; Restart in the lower-right corner of the screen. After your PC restarts, select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC.
<br />Then choose the option Remove everything.

<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then you can manage your system.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<p>CARAIO 130 PILAS POR 2 MG SE Ã‰ LOKO TROCA ESSE LIXO! cara eu uso net de 1 Mg, nÃ£o da leg, pode cair o mundo que nÃ£o cai a net e pago em torno de 70,00 (internet e televiÃ£o a cabo) fora o telefone que da uns 20,00 pago a parte, eu sÃ³ nÃ£o aumento a net pra
 10 MG porque estou pagando meu carro e quero fazer outra faculdade, mas se eu aumentar para 10Mg pagaria 99,00 (mais telefone) mesmo assim sairia mais barato que a sua de 2 MG.</p>
