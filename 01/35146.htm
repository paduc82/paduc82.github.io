<h2>            Changed GT but old GT still shows up in certain places...</h2>
                    
<p>Just as the subject says, I changed my GT last Sunday. All of my friends see my new GT and it shows up in all the games I play. But when I join or start a party, it shows me as my old GT, and everyone in the party sees my old GT. This has been going on for
 a week now. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>HDD &#39;Unformatted&#39; After Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDD &#39;Unformatted&#39; After Update</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Short Version:</strong><br />
Recent Dashboard update downloaded, said there wasn't enough space. Cancelled, didn't recognise any data on the drive, said it was unformatted. Why? How?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Long Version:</strong><br />
Since 2006 I have had my Xbox repaired 4 times, never had any issues with the drive. My most recent xbox failed out of warranty, so I bought a new 250GB model and used an official Xbox transfer kit to move from the 120GB to the 250GB (I had to do this once
 before when I upgraded from the 20Gb to 120GB).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was a few months ago now. Been having a great experience with the new model. Today I have a problem. Turned on my Xbox to download the new dashboard update. There was a weird flash to black which seemed to just be resetting, or something. After downloading
 it told me there was not enough space, which is weird because I wasn't even using half of the 250GB hard drive. So I canceled the update, but on the dashboard there were no user profiles. No games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browsing the memory section, it says my HDD is unformatted. How? Why? I used it perfectly fine last night. I have been turning it on just to party chat for the past week, so I didn't turn it off while a game was saving or any crazy business. I don't know
 what to do. The only option I have is to format the HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experience is mildly distressing. I am reluctant to do it. I will be saying goodbye to 140 games worth of save data, from 2006 to now. Not to mention all the DLC and Arcade games (I know I can redownload those but I can't remember everything I've bought).
 I can't accept that this is my fault in any way. I am curious as to how this could have happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is fairly futile but I am hoping I won't have to do this.</p>

<p>Thank you to both Prince Leo II and voteDC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called the support number and spoke to a very kind and helpful member of staff. As I know, I cannot recover my data. The hard drive is corrupted and must be formatted. The attitude to this, however, was 'it can happen'. Not the member of staff's fault
 of course, he was very patient and helpful, but as a consumer that isn't good enough. I did everything I was supposed to, I didn't interfere with the console during the update procedure. I am sure this is covered in their TOS, to make sure loss and damages
 are not held against them. How am I supposed to feel though, when the blame does not appear to rest with me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am curious about now is if there is anything more than I can do. I can't recover the data, and I sincerely doubt I would ever receive any sort of compensation for the loss of over 5 years of save data, but hopefully Microsoft would look in this in
 more detail to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else. I am open to suggestions if I can take this anywhere but it seems like i will just have to deal with it. Not something I am comfortable with.</p>

<p>I earlier today set my X-Box 360 S (250GB, like above) to automatically continue downloading my Active Downloads queue. I started up the console while the things were still downloading. It took a while at the X-Box 360 start-up screen. I didn't think this
 was a big deal. However, when the system finally got me into the home-page for my console, I couldn't access profiles, I couldn't access saves, nothing. I decided to redownload my gamertag from X-Box LIVE and found that my system wasn't recognizing my HDD.
 After seeing what you said about the memory section, I went to take a look. I found that my HDD was also "Unformatted". I certainly hope that I'm able to re-download everything again, because last night I spent roughly $200 on X-Box 360, X-Box, and Arcade
 games on the marketplace. It irks me highly that this happened so spontaneously, as well. It just decided to quit on me when I started it up.</p>

<p>DarKnife 14, did it happen with the update? I was told on the phone that it may have been due to the update being interrupted (which I didn't do).</p>
<p>WrittenBriarios, you can access your entire download history on Xbox.com and it helpfully categorizes them. You can download everything you've ever downloaded again, though save games and other temporary.user data cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>I would still like to know exactly why this happened. I didn't do anything that would cause it to happen.</p>

<p>Hey there Boss! What do you see when you open up the Storage Menu? Is the HDD recognized at all, or does it not even show up? If you can look inside, are there no files at all, or are they just unusable, possibly with a (!) icon next to them? Please let

<h2>            Wireless Mouse&#47;Keyboard not working after Windows 10 Reset</h2>
                    <p>I have an Iogear Long Range 2.4GHz Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo. After reset, neither work. I checked hardware onanother computer and both work fine. I also try switching out a Logitech combo, which worked on another computer,&nbsp; with the same result.
 Any ideas as to what the problem might be?</p>

<p>Hi <em>Walt0599</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting, and being part of the <em>community</em>. You mentioned on your post that you happened to
<strong>reset the PC</strong>, and after that the issue appeared. Resetting the PC is as good as installing the OS again, with the options to keep the personal files. Resetting the PC will require you to reinstall the programs and, same thing with the hardware
 drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to reinstall the driver of your <em>IOGEAR Mouse/Keyboard.</em>&nbsp;Do you still have the installer from the box (the one in a disk/CD)? If not, you will need to download it from the manufacturer's site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us more info when you get back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately, my Iogear combo doesn't require a driver to be loaded. Rather, when I plug the antenna into a USB slot, the computer should sense it and immediately function. Same is true with my other keyboard/keyboard combo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did solve the problem by following another post on your website which suggested downloading the reset tool onto an external storage device from a link provided and then reinstalling the reset from the external storage device rather than directly
 from the link. I did and it worked! I appreciate the assistance.</p>

<h2>            You Need a WIA driver to use this device. No scanners were detected. Epson Scan cannot be started. Solved</h2>
                    <p>I have an Epson Perfection 4490 Photo scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had it set up on my Windows 10 desktop for the longest time then mothballed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dug it out to use it with a laptop and it wouldn't work. Went through all the driver reinstall etc. Figured maybe it was too old for my current Windows 10 (1803 at the time of writing this) Then I tested it back on my desktop... same windows version....
 it was working under WIndows 10 on my desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms on the non working laptop were as follows:</p>
<p>Launch Windows fax and Scan, click on New Scan and get the message "No scanners were detected."</p>
<p>Launched Epson Scan (version 3.24 at the time of writing) and got the message "Epson Scan cannot be started."</p>
<p>I used Control Panel and ran Devices and Printers. In the Devices section there was Epson Scanner, but if I double click on it I get the message "You need a WIA driver for this device."</p>
<p>In Windows 10 Settings I select Devices then Printer and Scanners and I can see the Epson Scanner. I click on it and select Manage. This brings up the Epson Scanner Manage your device window and I select Scanner Properties and I see no devices... Tried adding
 a device but it is not found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Device Manager I see it under Imaging Devices and it has the exact same driver as my working system and it says it is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a LOT of troubleshooting, driver reinstalling, Epson removal utilities, checked USB cables, tried another USB port, restarts etc... then I stumbled upon a web page somewhere that said this was an old device, plug it into a USB 2,0 port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yup. Simple as that. As soon as I plug the scanner into a USB 2.0 port it all worked. Plugged it back into a USB 3 port, no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my laptop (Dell latitude E6530) has 4 USB ports, and it is NOT obvious which are USB 2 and which are USB 3... Some new systems colour the USB 3.0 ports blue. On my laptop the ports have a tiny SS beside the USB logo which stands for Super Speed. In my
 case the two USB 2 ports are located at the back left corner (on the angle) and the right side (eSATA USB combo port) and if I plug into those all is well. Check your system carefully, newer systems often have a mixture of USB 2 and USB 3 ports and various
 ways of indicating...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for this information. I did all that you did, so I appreciate your efforts and the resolution you were able to get to. However, I tried EVERY port on the computer (it has five on the back that work, one does not; four on the front; and a seven
 port external USB extender 2.0 High Speed Hub) and none of them recognize the EPSON DS-530 scanner. I got nothing. *sigh*

            Same for me as Anil, the app just opens itself in a window at random intervals. It can happen when I'm not even touching the keyboard. I close it, and some time later it reappears. Tried emptying the folder and the troubleshooter, but it's still doing
 it. Thanks for any help!<br />

<h2>            KB2841134&#63;  Another less than wonderful IE update experience</h2>
                    <p>I had a forced shutdown for updates last night and after powering up this morning it was apparent that it was a new version of IE (e.g. as seen by the names of modules being applied).&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp;there was no clue about what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered
 that I should be able to View Update History&nbsp; but there is nothing which supports that recollection apparent in the W7 Start Menu Search.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, I found it by typing only upd and finding Windows Update which does have a link to View Update History.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Then by sorting descending on Date Installed&nbsp; I could see that my guess was correct:&nbsp; Name was Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-baased Systems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, this was a disappointing result.&nbsp; All it says is that I have IE 11, that the install was successful and that it was an "important" update.&nbsp; Then nothing but marketing bumf.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. More information:</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>E.g. nothing to explain why I got this, especially since I still had the IE11 Preview installed.&nbsp; Shouldn't I at least be offered the option of uninstalling the Preview and then getting the new version cleanly?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Again, assuming that that is what has happened.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>wmic.exe qfe where (InstalledOn = "11/9/2013")</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>indicates that&nbsp; HotFixID = KB2841134</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Search for that finds nothing?&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Now it gets</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps I was too quick to check?&nbsp; But how does the average interested user&nbsp;learn about KB2841134 without knowing about QFE (or PowerShell's Get-Hotfix applet)?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Fortunately with the latter I can at least pipe to Sort-Object InstalledOn and not have to
 either extract by date or do subsequent finds to be sure that I have found the latest updates. )</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore, apparently I had previously had two instances of the same thing which had failed.&nbsp; Code 9C47.&nbsp; Search for that in Support gets no hits?&nbsp; (Actually finds irrelevant articles by matching on a portion of a product ID).&nbsp; Widening the search to the
 web (e.g. using BING) shows this code was previously seen by several IE9 users.&nbsp; Did any of those try using the decimal equivalent of this code:&nbsp; 40007...&nbsp; some did apparently, including some IE10 users.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(BING Search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9c47 40007 update failed<br />
)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>11 hits (so far)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Aha.&nbsp; Apparently what I should have done is taken a peek inside&nbsp; WindowsUpdate.log</p>

<p><strong>Setup exit code: 0x00009C47 (40007) - Required updates failed to download.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>So, whether the previous two failures were due to unexpected events due to having IE11 Preview installed or just a couple of &nbsp;interrupted downloads, I suppose I don't really care.&nbsp; I am just supposed to be happy that it finally worked?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, now do I have to do anything about the presumably now superseded but <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb2879017-with-ie11-on-w7sp1/44ec6330-780b-4ae3-865a-86bd0a703f25?page=1">
previously blocked KB2879017</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a <em>Restore hidden updates</em>&nbsp; link in Windows Update.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will that show me a list?&nbsp; Not obvious.&nbsp; Is there help about this item?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not even a clue about it under&nbsp;

            <p>Was&nbsp;IE11 Developer Preview&nbsp;or&nbsp;IE11 Release Preview (for WIn7 SP1) installed on or before 09 November 2013, Robert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The availability of IE11 Final for Win7 SP1 was announced on 07 November 2013:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;QP&gt;<br />
Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is available worldwide in 95 languages for download today. We will begin automatically updating Windows 7 customers to IE11 in the weeks ahead,
<em>starting today with customers running the IE11 Developer and Release Previews</em>.... [emphasis mine]</p>
<p>&lt;/QP&gt;</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/11/07/ie11-for-windows-7-globally-available-for-consumers-and-businesses.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/11/07/ie11-for-windows-7-globally-available-for-consumers-and-businesses.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By now, I assume you know that KB2841134 points to a legit KB article entitled
<strong>Internet Explorer 11 is now available</strong> =&gt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2841134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2841134</a> [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since IE11 Release Preview was listed as <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 11</strong> [sic] in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>, the listing wouldn't have changed after installing IE11 Final but you may find KB2841134 listed in
<strong>Update History</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not aware of any IE11 Prerequisite updates. That being said, the 9C47 error when upgrading IE has been associated with missing Prerequisites since IE9 for Vista was released many moons ago (and possibly earlier). That being said...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I still can't figure out why <font color="#0072c6"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2879017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2879017</a></font> was offered to your Win7 computer with IE11 Release Preview installed&nbsp;when
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">MS13-080</font></a> clearly lists Win7/IE11 in the <strong>
<em>Non-Affected Software</em></strong> section. Perhaps you can ask about this in the IE MVP listserv?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I understand that you had not&nbsp;run Fix It 51001 before KB2879017 was released &amp; offered to your computer.</p>

<p>Nope.&nbsp; Only using wmic or Powershell, as I mentioned.&nbsp; But thanks for pointing out that the KB article now exists.</p>

<p>Aha...&nbsp; there's a labeled link in Help, About which does the same redirect: "You've got our latest browser".&nbsp; I think I would rather be redirected to the KB article but at least this now makes some sense and as I indicated at the time I posted this that

<p><br />
Sort of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large text is&nbsp; Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Version: is (a patch level?)&nbsp;11.0.9600.16428.&nbsp; Then my Update Versions:&nbsp; is&nbsp; RTM (KB2841134)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, this shows that <em>Install new versions automatically</em> is checked so if that had been checked when the Preview was installed I suppose it could help explain why I wasn't given any notice of the switch from Preview to RTM.&nbsp; ICIM Product ID: 00150-20000-00003-AA459</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW I'd like to know how to query about such details&nbsp;using WMIC or Powershell.&nbsp; E.g. getting the same kind of details when iexplore.exe is not available.&nbsp; Evidently this is not the way:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\&gt;wmic.exe softwarefeature where (name like "%explorer%") list brief</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>E.g. if we had something of that nature it would appear more explicit and easier to produce than doing things such as using msinfo32&nbsp; Loaded Modules, sort by Version, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be helpful I think for dealing with questions such as "I have deleted Internet
 Explorer but I can't reinstall it".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The best I have found so far is&nbsp;using&nbsp; DISM&nbsp; but this requires having Administrator authority:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\&gt;dism.exe /online /get-features | findstr /i "explorer"<br />
Feature Name : Internet-Explorer-Optional-amd64</p>
<p>C:\&gt;dism.exe /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:Internet-Explorer-Optional-amd64</p>

<p>Feature Information:</p>

I have no idea, Robert.&nbsp; I've mentioned&nbsp;your recent&nbsp;threads (about KB2879017 being offered to Win7 with IE11 RP installed)&nbsp;to newby IE&nbsp;MVP &amp; ex-MS&nbsp;Eric Lawrence. Maybe he'll show up here &amp; give you a hand?</p>

 I'm very disappointed with this. I love the media sharing function as i use it with my xbox 360. I have tried disabling all windows and any possible firewalls, i have checked all required services to be working in services.msc , I cannott locate the problem,

<h2>            Flickering screen and unable to maximize items</h2>
                    Yesterday, I was in a program and the screen started flickering from the screen to black several times before stopping on the item I wanted.&nbsp; When I went to play a game, which is normally full screen, it has the game in the upper left hand corner and will
 not allow it to be maximized.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with flickering screen, do let us know the following to assist you better:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>How often you see black/ flickering screen on your device?</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Is the issue of maximizing the screen confined to any particular game?</li><li>Were you able to see any error code with this issue?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that screen flickering in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> is usually caused by incompatible apps or display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer to the troubleshooting steps like <span>Check to see if
<strong>Task Manager flickers</strong>, </span><span><strong>Uninstall an incompatible app</strong>,
</span><span><strong>Update your display driver </strong>from the </span>Microsoft article about flickering screen and check if it helps.</p>

<p>Hello-</p>
<p>This is a continuation of the thread located here: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/d18c94ef-e995-49bc-adf9-4a79e9d790e1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/d18c94ef-e995-49bc-adf9-4a79e9d790e1/</a>&nbsp; I'm starting a new thread as it seems like the moderators may believe the&nbsp;question was answered (myself and one other having the same issue came
 in late to the discussion).</p>
<p>My issue is that I have had the following VSS error listed in the event viewer starting the day I received my new laptop (I only recently discovered these errors, however, when a disk image backup program kept failing):</p>
<p>Volume Shadow Copy Service warning: VSS was denied access to the root of volume\\?\Volume{3dda6e5b-ed17-11df-a869-c2b558ad3773}\<span>Denying administrators from accessing volume roots can cause many unexpected failures, and will prevent VSS from
 functioning properly. Check security on the volume, and try the operation again.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried the&nbsp; <strong>icacls</strong>&nbsp;C:\ <strong>/grant system:f</strong> command a number of times and it always "succesfully processed one file."&nbsp; But this has not resolved the issue.&nbsp; The same errors keep showing up in the event logs.</span></p>
<p><span>Running VSSadmin List Providers (with elevated privileges) gives:</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool<br />
(C) Copyright 2001-2005 Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Provider name: 'Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider 1.0'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Provider type: System<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Provider Id: {b5946137-7b9f-4925-af80-51abd60b20d5}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Version: 1.0.0.7</p>
<p>However, almost every other VSSAdmin command throws an error, including VSSAdmin list shadowstorage:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;Vssadmin list shadowstorage<br />
vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool<br />
(C) Copyright 2001-2005 Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Error: The shadow copy provider had an unexpected error while trying to process<br />
the specified command.</p>
<p>Anyone have any thoughts on how to resolve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, What volume is volume\\?\Volume{3dda6e5b-ed17-11df-a869-c2b558ad3773}?&nbsp; Is this the C: drive or something else?</p>
<p>Thanks-</p>

<h2>            Choppy sound - regardless of sound card, vista or win 7.</h2>
                    Having problems with choppy sound, regardless of program running. Had problem with Vista. Using Sound Blaster X-Fi card.&nbsp; Was losing sound when windows performed an automatic update.&nbsp; Got sound back after recent update, but was choppy. Bought new card
 Diamond Xtreme Sound 7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Still had choppy sound, even with newest Vista drivers.&nbsp; Upgraded to Win 7 and changed card back to SB X-Fi. Loaded newest drivers from Creative. Still choppy.&nbsp; No conflicts registering in device manager. I have a Gateway DX420X
 with 2 GB of RAM.&nbsp; Changed out RAM, no change in sound.&nbsp; I use digital I/O for digital speakers.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p><span>Hi spudboyzsz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you’re using Digital I/O for digital speakers, the bottom line to get the Digital I/O module working is by trying the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; Click on the Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the Sound Option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Switch
 to playback tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on Speakers and click on Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the Custom tab, click on Digital Only.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Apply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t work, then you need to check your speakers if they are working on a different computer. If it is not working, then you can check
 if your Speakers manufacturer has any suggestions on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            <p>Hi HowardGarlinger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be grateful if you can reply to these questions in order to assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Have you let the scan complete?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</p>
<p>3. Are you able to boot to the desktop fine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try these steps to disable the auto check.</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>You may try the steps to disable autochecking.</p>
<p>a. Click Start then type <b>regedit</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>b. Right click on <b>regedit.exe</b> and then click "<b>Run as administrator</b>".</p>
<p>c. Expand the "+" to the following keys. </p>
<p><b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</b></p>
<p>d. There is a value here called <b>BootExecute</b>. If bmssldr is listed in the data section then remove it.</p>
<p>If not follow these steps, the default value of the key is autocheck autochk *,* means every drive is checked for consistency.
</p>
<p>e. Just add /<b>K:C at the end before *</b>. /K switch will disable autocheck on C: drive at Windows startup. So the final value should look like this:</p>
<p><b>autocheck autochk /k:C</b></p>
<p>&gt; If you want to add more drives, the key should look like this: (disabling C and D drives)</p>
<p><b>autocheck autochk /k:C /k:D *</b></p>
<p>&gt; If you want to restore everything to default, just replace the key with the default one i.e.,</p>
<p>autocheck autochk *</p>
<p><b>Important:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>The above mentioned steps tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
</p>
<p>For further information, refer the article:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up the registry</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you may try running a check disk from Windows receovery environment.</p>
<p><span><span>You may try to run check disk command from WINRE using Windows Vista full version disc and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. When you are prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. <strong>Choose</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>language</strong>
<strong>settings</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Command Prompt</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>chkdsk</strong> /f /r X:( drive letter)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</p>

    <title>Homegroup&#47;Workgroup printing problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wonderfulworld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup&#47;Workgroup printing problem</h2>
                    I want to connect my three computers wirelessly so that they can all share my HP LaserJet 1020 printer.&nbsp; The three computers are: a HP m7100e running Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp;(64-bit), a Dell Dimension 3200 running XP Home Edition, and a Gateway MD2614u
 also running Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp;(64-bit).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The HP computer&nbsp;has a wired internet connection and is connected to the HP LaserJet 1020.&nbsp; The other two access the internet wirelessly.<br />
<br />
The two computers running Windows 7 are linked through Homegroup&nbsp;and the Dell connects to the other two via workgroup.&nbsp;&nbsp; When on, the three computers can easily share files.&nbsp; However, when it comes to printing I have problems.<br />
<br />
I have turned on printer sharing on the HP computer.&nbsp; When printing from either the Gateway or Dell (The HP computer and printer are on and the printer selected is the HP LaserJet on the HP m7100e), the status of the print job changes to "spooling" and then
 "printing".&nbsp; However my printer doesn't print!&nbsp; When I view the status of the print job (originating from one of&nbsp;the other two computers)&nbsp;from the HP computer, it also "says printing."<br />
<br />
The only way I have found&nbsp;to get the print job to go&nbsp;through is to restart the HP m7100e.<br />
However, I don't to have to restart the HP computer every time I want to print from one of these computers.<br />
<br />
On a side note, is there any way to stay signed in to a workgroup on XP without re-logging in every time&nbsp;I turn it on?

                    I was trying to edit a sound clip and did something wrong. A black box appeared above my timeline and a black box was entered before each photo. I can see video clips but and I can see how long they are, but the only thing that plays is a black screen
 with captions for each video visible. How do I recover a view of my video clips?

<h2>            &#40;BOOTCAMP&#41;Window installation on mac, failed to find disk image</h2>
                    When i tried to install windows 10 on my mac i used bootcamp. I finished installing the iso files and i partioned the disks evenly. So my mac restarted and went into the windows sign in. I put in the correct language then i hit next. I put in the product
 key and went to the next page. On the next page it said "No disk image availiable". Ive tried to restart the system and use a different ISO file but it still doesnt work. Does anyone know how to solve this?

<p>Why would it be bad anyway? It's not as though it's doing anything it wouldn't be doing if you were using it, and it's not as though it's going to be moving it while you're not using it.</p>

<p>I do it all the time :D I also have to, however, since my disk tray won't come out if there isn't a disk inside.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kamal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the Methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>For those that use Comcast I discovered that having a Comcast gateway/modem/router set to bridge mode was causing Defender and Update to fail. Once I reset the Comcast gateway to the default mode updates started flowing again.</p>

I really do not know what to do, I have been searching online for a key lead if BEX relates to video driver, to windows server 2008, or perhaps to the processor kernel but with no luck. In my search I&nbsp;understand those are the three leads to explore
 but I run out of options. or perhaps a specific service needs to be turned on or off. please help!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if more information is needed but information gathering may be beyond my skill in windows 7, a light description of what to do to get those information would be more than appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Seb</p>
