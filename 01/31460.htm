<h2>            ALL TEXT IS MISSING FROM WINDOWS&#33; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    As the title states, no text on any program besides chrome, is available. This even includes task manager, file explorer, control panel, and command prompt! The problem does not go away in safe mode. I do not have a previous restore point to fall back
 on! I believe I may have caused the problem by accidentally deleting an important file, but I really have no idea.&nbsp;

            Hello, I understand that you are having problems with text appearing on your Windows PC. You may want to run the DISM file check. More on that here:

<br />If this doesn't resolve the problem, "Refreshing the PC" will most likely do the fix.

<p>I do not have access to command prompt. This is because whenever I load command prompt there is no prompt for text and text does not appear when I type. I have already tried inputing commands anyway but to no success. This problem does NOT go away in safe
 mode and the only way I can use command prompt is through the advanced startup. I have already tried using the DISM file check this way and got the following error message:&nbsp;dism doesn't support servicing windows PE with the /online option. So yeah, how do
 I fix this problem while I have no access to command prompt whithout the advanced startup or command prompt in safe mode?</p>

            yeah, that would be really nice. unfortunately, whenever I try, it tells me that there was an error and undos the changes. When I try to do a clean restart from the windows security center, it crashes without starting. Windows 10 has so many glitches that
 it is honestly beyond insane for a company of the scale of Microsoft. So how else can I reset the computer?

            You may want to boot into the USB Windows 10 image. You need to download the media creation tool from here:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />You will need to change the boot priority options, and boot into the USB itself. Then, on the bottom right, click on the Repair this PC option. You should be able to access the Startup Repair from there. Try Startup Repair, then try doing the DISM(from USB), then if all the above doesn't work, you will have to Refresh your PC. Hope this helps!

    <title>Missing options in pop-up menus after Win10 Anniversary update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m100elan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing options in pop-up menus after Win10 Anniversary update</h2>
                    After installing Win10 Anniversary update, I see no text in the pop-up box when you right-click the start menu or when you click on the "hidden icons" symbol. &nbsp;The text appears if I print screen, but there is no highlighting when making a selection. &nbsp;The
 next time you click on the same pop-up for which you did the print screen, the text is missing again - you see an empty box. &nbsp;I clean-installed video drivers and was able to see all text in the boxes after installing, but after shutting the computer down and
 restarting the next day, the problem of no text in pop-ups recurs. &nbsp;This problem is on a 64-bit computer, and I see someone else is having problems on a 32 bit computer. &nbsp;This problem also occurs in Internet Explorer and Chrome but not Firefox when right-clicking
 e.g. a news link on Google News. &nbsp;Does anyone have a way to resolve the problem? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.

            <p><span>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither of the suggestions worked.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SFC scan did not find any integrity violations (FYI, it is very difficult to find the administrator‚Äôs command prompt with this problem, because no text appears
 in the box when you hit Windows+x keys ‚Äì only the box‚Äôs outline appears).&nbsp; There was no improvement when I rebooted after the SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then created a new account.&nbsp; I had the same problem in the new account, where the new account did not display text in the pop-up boxes.&nbsp; The new account performed
 worse than the existing account.&nbsp; In addition to the no-text-in-popup boxes, nothing occurred when I tried using the ‚Äústart‚Äù icon in the new account.&nbsp; Nothing happened when I left-clicked or right-clicked.&nbsp; I exited using ctrl-alt-del.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;ErrantKarabella,</p><p><br /></p><p>From the FAQ:</p><p><br /></p><p><b>How do I know how many Rewards Credits I've earned and how will I know when they have been converted to my local currency and deposited into my Microsoft account?<br /></b></p><p><b>First, log in to Xbox Live Rewards and head over to the MyRewards page. Once you are on the MyRewards page, click on 'View MyStatement.' MyStatement is a summary of all your rewards activity. You can view:</b></p><b>
<ul><li>Pending Rewards Credits:&nbsp;Credits you've earned that have not yet been converted to your local currency and deposited into your Microsoft account</li><li>Rewards Credits Deposits:&nbsp;Credits that have already been converted to your country's local currency and deposited in your Microsoft account.</li><li>Previous Month:&nbsp;Activity over the past month</li><li>Past 6 Months:&nbsp;Activity over the past 6 months</li><li>Lifetime:&nbsp;All your activity for the entire duration of your Xbox Live Rewards membership.</li></ul>
</b><p><b>You'll also receive a MyStatement email each month that shows your Rewards Credits activity summary.<br /></b></p><p><br /></p><p>However, looking over your purchases, you will not complete any offers with your purchases, so they will not award any Credits at this time. Your movie purchase will progress the Microsoft Movies and TV&nbsp;offer, but will not complete it. Your other example, Assassin's Creed Origins on January 1st, did not complete any offers, so it similarly did not award Rewards Credits.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>For reference, you can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:</p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the MyMissions page at <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a> .
  </p>
<p>-or-
  </p>
<p>2. For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star MyVIP level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as MyVIP payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders, in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP.
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>MyVIP had a recalibration for the last few years. At the end of the year, we place you in your MyVIP rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016. We did not recalibrate this year (December 2017). Since you are a zero star member, you do not get MyVIP payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, as i stated i was Wirelessly installing the scan to computer option of my printer onto my laptop. It prompted me to restart after it installed and thats when the blue screen stop code thing happened. It advised me to tell a person "Stop Code: SYSTEM
 THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did try to reboot without deleting apps, files and pics. But it keeps going back to the blue screen. I also too was able to get on using safe mode so i transfered everything i wanted to save to my OneDrive&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I bought the retail disc from Amazon.com since it is no longer available on steam. I have a legit brand new copy not the ghetto torrents .</p>
<p>My Problem-</p>
<p>The disc pulls up fine and the install wizard pulls up. It starts installing and about halfway through it just freezes and I have to end up closing it.</p>
<p>Is there a patch or update for this game? </p>
<p>I have searched forever on the internets and the cmmnd line DEP fix does not work for me. I turned off the security boot and restarted and it still wouldn't install.
</p>
<p>** SIDE NOTE- I have many games on steam that are 2006 - 2010 that run just fine on the windows 10 64 bit. Blood Stone is 2010 its not that old.
</p>
<p>Anybody out there had success installing blood stone from disc?? </p>

 work in the usb ports but not my mouse or any other usb mouse for that matter. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I want to add I did not install any new programs or devices, it just quit working suddenly. The red light comes on for the mouse but I can't

<p>Hi Ddchrist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try using a different usb port and check if the port is faulty.</p>
<div><br />
I would recommend you to uninstall the mouse from the device manager using the keyboard.<br />
Here is how:<br />
1. Press windows key on the keyboard and type device manager in the search bar and press enter.<br />
2. Now the device manager window will open up and then press tab key once.<br />
3. Now use the down arrow key to Mice and other pointing devices.<br />
4. Expand this option by using the right arrow key and choose the mouse installed using the up and down arrow keys.<br />
5. Highlight the mouse and then press "right click" key on the keyboard i.e next to the ctrl key.<br />
5. Choose uninstall and press enter.<br />
6. Restart the computer and then check if the mouse works.</div>
<div><br />
Hope this helps.</div>

<br />This is a difficult situation to be in. You can tackle this by reinstalling Windows, or attempting an in-place upgrade. This could be caused by having AVG or Avast in the system, it's not definite but it's quite possible.
<br />
<br />Use the Media Creation Tool to prepare an 8 GB minimum flash drive: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then plug in your flash drive while Windows is on the desktop, go into Task Manager if possible (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC or CTRL + ALT + DEL &gt; Task Manager), go to File &gt; Run new task &gt; Browse. You can then look for the flash drive in This PC, and run setup.exe. Be sure to follow the prompts and specifically mention an upgrade.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need any further assistance with this process, and good luck.

<p>Had the same issue. Rendered my computer completely useless. </p>

</p><p>I created a backup using the Recovery Manager and restored my computer to the factory settings. Now I have no way to use by backup to get to my settings before the Windows update!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Home Screen a little more clear&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone. Just a quick thought that i had,&nbsp;that i wanted to hear some other people's&nbsp;opinions on.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is it just me,&nbsp;or does anybody else wish that the Xbox one's home screen was a little more clear? That it didn't have as much junk on it? Ya' know, so you could see your wallpaper a bit better? Maybe some of the stuff on the home screen could be found in other tabs rather than taking up space on your home screen. I feel like the wallpaper setting is kind of useless if you can't really see your wallpaper that well. but, i don't know. That's just me.</p><p><br /></p><p>What do you all think?</p><p><br /></p>

            <p><strong>Hmmm... I think this thread should be re-titled "Xbox One Home Screen a little more less cluttered?" since I was fully prepared to come here and say that my home screen is clear enough on my 4k tv. I feel ripped off kinda since you're really just wanting less things on the "dashboard" so you can see your background better. IMO the title of this thread needs to be more "clear". :P&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>I agree. You get this spam and ads and content from friends of friends and randoms! This so called, recommended stuff. Even if you pay for an XBL Gold membership subscription. With paid services you generally don't get ads and spam. But with Xbox, you get them anyway, regardless! This is what happens when they try to put a PC OS on a console! Well, a dumbed down version of Windows 10. Xbox 360's current UI is nowhere near this cluttered. This following system, this broadcast system with no emphasis on YouTube, but Mixer and Twitch which I don't care about. Someone must be high at Microsoft, with so many boxes, you would think it's touch screen and gestures enabled. It was, until they took away that Kinect feature. Just goes to show, they can't think outside the square! What's even more worse, they add even more squares and boxes. I do have to give some credit to the OS though. The version Xbox One launched with, was 100x slower. Now I can load common messages friends lists and my stuff without

            Hi  Tommaso, are you trying to update to version 1803?
<br />
<br />It sounds like you tried to update from the ISO, is that correct/
<br />
<br />If so, try this method using that ISO from your hard drive"
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

yes I'm trying to update to 1803 and thanks for your reply.<br />

I have already tried installing from iso, from my own ssd and from an usb key. <br />
<br />
Both ended with the error&nbsp;Windows 10 Update keeps failing - "0x8007001F - 0x20006"</p>

            The Setup diagnostic tool reports the following:
<br />
<br />Error: SetupDiag reports Optional Component corruption failure. Error: 0x8007001F
<br />Recommend you check the "Windows Modules Installer" service (Trusted Installer) is started on the system and set to automatic start, reboot and try the update again.  Optionally, you can check the status of optional components on the system (search for Windows Features), uninstall any unneeded optional components, reboot and try the update again.
<br />
<br />I smell something related to IIS. First check for Windows Module Installer service as said. Then if needed disable IIS and then try again.

            It sounds like your Windows file associations have come undone. This means that XP no<br />
longer knows what to do with files by looking at the file extension (like .exe for executables,<br />
.doc for MS documents, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you did not do it yourself, something did it for you - most likely malicious software.<br />
<br />
Go to this WWW site by Doug Knox:<br />
<br />
http://www.dougknox.com/<br />
<br />
On the left, click the Win XP Fixes, File Association Fixes, and read the directions at the top of the page.<br />
<br />
Download the EXE File Association Fix to your desktop, unzip the file and apply it using the instructions from the top of the page, then reboot.<br />
<br />
Run the following scans for malicious software and then fix any remaining issues:<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 running on XP won&#39;t connect to the internet and retrieve ripped CD information. </h2>
                    This used to work for me. Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Player tab has "Connect to the Internet" box checked. On the Library tab the "Retrieve additional information from the Internet" box is checked. I haven't changed any defaults that I know of. I reinstalled
 WMP 11 to no avail. I turned off the firewall. And I am connected to the internet. For some reason unknown to me WMP 11 doesn't have a connection to the internet. When I use Tools -&gt; Apply media info changes, I get the Apply Changes window with&nbsp; the progress
 percent complete stuck on 0%. I have found this question asked a few times but either not answered or an answer that doesn't solve the problem (e.g., turn off firewall)

<br />
<br />It won't allow webmail to be set as Default, unless it's added to Windows 10 Mail app.  You can still use the ad-ridden webmail if you want, but you need to add it first to Windows 10 Mail to have the right click default.  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> jbh_stl  say:</h3>
<h2>            APPCRASH error with ScanWizard 5 on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I was hoping to be able to use my Medion 90070 flatbed scanner (about three years old?) with the new desktop computer I just built (Intel i7 920, 6 GB RAM) running Windows 7 64-bit. I installed the scanner software from the CD and tried to run it. No luck:
 I got the following error message:<br />
<br />
<strong>FILESCAN MFC Application has stopped working</strong> <br />
<br />
Under "View problem details" was the following:<br />
<br />
Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APPCRASH<br />
&nbsp; Application Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScanWizard5.exe<br />
&nbsp; Application Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0.0.1<br />
&nbsp; Application Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3c3d38b3<br />
&nbsp; Fault Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KodakCMS.dll<br />
&nbsp; Fault Module Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.0.7.0<br />
&nbsp; Fault Module Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 378a2d56<br />
&nbsp; Exception Code:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c0000005<br />
&nbsp; Exception Offset:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000f96f<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.48<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1033<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 066b<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 066b621ff0b9e5b3ff9c739aed581ece<br />

&nbsp; Additional Information 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1bc9fc3f12814c1f3d975ac2b03e5715<br />
<br />
I found and downloaded a newer version of KodakCMS.dll and tried deleting the old version from C:\Program Files (x86)\ScanWizard 5 and pasting in the newer file, but that didn't work--same error.<br />
<br />
I called the scanner manufacturer (Medion), and the tech said they didn't yet have any drivers for Windows 7 and couldn't guarantee that they would. He suggested trying to run the program in compatibility mode, which I did (various versions of XP and Vista).
 Still the same error.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions for how I might get this thing working?

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Uninstall the Canon software using Control Panel ‚Äì Programs and Features.</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<strong><span>start</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Type
<strong><span>appwiz.cpl</span></strong> in Start Search</span></p>
<p><span>c. Search for the

<h2>            Can&#39;t Establish Connection to the Internet</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Problem:&nbsp; Can't Establish a Wirless Connection to the Internet</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Reference Links are listed at the end of&nbsp;these comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I live several states away from the laptop having the problem, so I am trying to fix it via phone calls, information that I have found on the Net:&nbsp; printable instructions, YouTube videos, sometimes, verifing their settings via Crossloop
 then "hanging up" before having them try to connect, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these instructions, YouTube videos, state that they are setting up a WRT160N router, but their screen snapshots appear to be for a type-G network.&nbsp; The parameters on their shown 192.186.1.1 setup pages do not match those for the type-N router; e.g.,
 the Wi-Fi Protected Setup parameters are missing.&nbsp; Their setup pages differ greatly.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Our System:</strong></p>
<p>HP G60-533cl laptop<br />
HP Photosmart Premium C309g Printer (print/copy/scan)<br />
Connection Type:&nbsp; DSL (AT&amp;T/Yahoo)<br />
Linksys WRT160N Ver.3.0 Wireless Router<br />
Modem: SIEMENS speedStream 4100 Ethernet ADSL<br />
OS:&nbsp; Windows 7, 64-bit Home Premium.<br />
Browsers:&nbsp; Internet Explorer 9 (IE9), Firefox<br />
All units are plugged into a Surge Suppressor</p>
<p><br />
<strong>A Brief History:<br />
Previous Problem:<br />
</strong>Couldn't connect to the Net, after losing connection due to a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>The problem was solved by doing the following.</p>
<p>1) Powering-down and unplugging every thing for a few minutes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: the router was left connected to the modem.<br />
2) Plugged-in and powered up the modem, and gave it time to stabilize.<br />
3) Plugged-in the router (it auto-powered-up: no On/Of button), and gave it time to stabilize.<br />
4) Powered-up the laptop (which had a wireless connection to the router)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and gave it time to boot properly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: It established its wireless connection to the router.<br />
5) Opened up IE8:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The connection to our web Home Page came up without any problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last fall, Microsoft auto-installed IE9 during one of its auto-updates.<br />
We weren't given the option to not install it and keep IE8.</p>
<p>Things appeared to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curent problem: <br />
</strong>Same as above...couldn't connect to the Net.<br />
I performed the same steps as above, but couldn't establish a connection to the Net.<br />
I tried various combinations of the wired/wireless steps above but couldn't establish a connection.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The router has 8 lights on the front:</strong></p>
<p><br />
When working properly, all lights below are ON, except for Ethernet ports 1-4.<br />
From left-to-right, the lights' ON/OFF states were:</p>
<p><br />
OFF: Ethernet ports 1-4 :&nbsp; <br />
ON:&nbsp; Wi-Fi Protected Setup Button/light : Wireless : Internet : Power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the storm, all lights returned to their states given above EXCEPT for the Wi-Fi Protected Setup Button: its light stayed off.<br />
Pressing the button would not help:&nbsp; its color changed from blue to amber,indicating that there was a problem.</p>
<p>Doing a soft-reset on the router (holding the reset button down for a couple seconds) did not help... but I could establish a wired connection to the Net, via an Ethernet cable connecting the router to the laptop.</p>
<p>I installed the router software that came on a steup disk with the router: this did not help.&nbsp; The router identified our previous setup information.</p>
<p>I performed a hard-reset on the router: unplugged its AC power cord for a few minutes, then powered it up, and ran the install software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The install software behaved like it did during its first (initial) install when it was new.&nbsp; It did not recognize anything.<br />
I went though the entire setup process, which included a wired connection from the router to the laptop.&nbsp; The software said that it has successfully installed a wireless connection.</p>
<p>The laptop was able to connect to the web via IE9; but, when I disconnected the Ethernet wire from the router to the laptop, I lost the connection to the Web,</p>
<p><br />
If the laptop was initiallly shut down and the Ethernet cable was not connected to the laptop, when IE9 was brought up, the laptop could not connect to the Web.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought up <strong>Windows Newtwork and Sharing Center</strong>.&nbsp; When my connection was "wired" the
</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Center</strong> displayed the <strong>laptop-&gt;router-&gt;Net</strong> map, but when I disconnected the
<strong>Ethernet-to-laptop</strong> cable, the <strong>Sharing Center</strong> dislayed "no connection".&nbsp;&nbsp; The router icon was replaced with a
<strong>large red X</strong>.&nbsp; When wired, our network has a status of "connected".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When wireless, the "networks available" but would show our network&nbsp; status as "Connected" or "Connecting":&nbsp; It would oscillate between these two states, but a
<strong>large red X</strong> still appeared in the <strong>laptop-&gt;router-&gt;Net</strong> network map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our network was originally setup 3 years ago, there was no problem getting the router to work correctly.&nbsp; Back then, we also installed
<strong>Network Magic</strong> to use its GUI to simplify tasks, e.g. add a printer, add/change a connection (re-establish it if it disconnected, etc.)<br />
Things worked fine.&nbsp; Now, <strong>Network Magic</strong> gives the same result as
<strong>Microsoft's Network and Sharing Center</strong>.&nbsp; It could not establish a steady Internet connection for our laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My impression is that there is a simple solution. Somewhere, there may be a switch (checkbox) that is improperly set, preventing the laptop from establishing the wireless connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that really bothers me is that the Linksys router setup software said that we had successfully setup a wireless connection...but...with the Ethernet cable still connected from the router to the laptop.&nbsp; How can the software establish/analyze a
<em>wireless</em> connectiuon when a connection is still wired ... or ... are both, wired and wireless information, being broadcasted simultaneously ?</p>

            Did you use the /safeboot option in msconfig?&nbsp; If so, there is some malware that will prevent you from restarting in normal mode.<br />
<br />
From frequent contributor Jose Ibarra (now posting in these forums under a different name):<br />
<br />
<p>There is some malicious software that if you enable the /SAFEBOOT option in msconfig, your system will never boot again in any mode (I will never suggest
<i>that</i> idea again!) - until you get rid of the option or temporarily rename your c:\boot.ini file so you don't have one, and then you can fix it using the XP Recovery Console.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This particular malicious software recognizes that you are using the /SAFEBOOT option to try to find it and get rid of it, so it won't let your system boot hoping that you will give up and reinstall your XP from scratch.<br />
<br />
In a single partition configuration, XP will complain a missing c:\boot.ini file but still boot just fine (if there are no other problems).&nbsp; Non believers - try it!</p>
<p>Here is what I would do:<br />
<br />
Create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and boot on that (instructions below).<br />
<br />
Enter these commands:<br />
<br />
cd&nbsp; \&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (back up/return to the root directory on the C drive)<br />
attrib&nbsp; -shr&nbsp; boot.ini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (remove system, hidden and read only attributes)<br />
ren boot.ini&nbsp; boot.ini.bak&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (rename the afflicted boot.ini file)<br />
<br />
Remove the CD and reboot on your HDD and XP will complain about the missing boot.ini, but should still boot.<br />
<br />
In Explorer, navigate to your C:\ folder, and rename the boot.ini.bak file to boot.ini (this is so msconfig will be able to find it).<br />
<br />
Run msconfig again and remove the afflictions like /SAFEBOOT and save the changes, etc.&nbsp; (you don't have to reboot if you don't want to).<br />
<br />
If you want, you can just edit the boot.ini by hand, but not everybody is comfortable doing that.</p>

<p>****************Create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD***********************</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p><br />
If you make the CD and boot on it, just enter 'help' to see if it is working.</p>

            I've updated my windows a lot recently as I had them turned off for a long while, I think it might be linked to some other programs that are installed which seem to be currupted.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I want to re-install windows and have been trying to create a bootable windows usb installer from an iso (use my valid licence key of course) but had no luck today.</div>

            Try uninstalling all Apple products from the computer, restart and then reinstall them.<br />
<br />
Regarding the USB installer, if you aren't already, you can use the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool:

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I rip CD&#39;s to my PC&#63;</h2>
                    According to the online support, I have the correct version of Windows Media Player for Windows 8 but I just can't do it.&nbsp; I want to be able to add music to my MP3 player so it's really frustrating.
