            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + R to open the Run command and then type (or copy/paste) <strong>
services.msc</strong> and click OK. This will open the Services console.</li><li>Scroll down <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong> and then double click to open. The Startup type should show as "<strong>Manual</strong>". If it shows as Disabled, click the down arrow to the right of it and set it to Manual. Click Apply/OK
 to take you back to the console again. <br />
</li><li>Next, scroll down to <strong>Windows Update</strong> and double click it. This should be set to
<strong>Automatic</strong>. Change it to that by the same means if it isn't and then close the Services console.
</li></ol>
<p>If the values for either or both of these were set to Disabled, there may be a virus installed on your system. The error code you're seeing is one that's associated with malware on a system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a precaution, go to the following link and download the free version of Malwarebytes.&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run a full system scan and delete anything it finds. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on please. </p>

            I'm getting this too. &nbsp;The services mentioned are running OK and a Malwarebytes scan comes up clean. &nbsp;The only Potentially Unwanted Program I've been aware of recently has been Windows 10.

            I previously tried the solution from Xircal after seeing it online and it did not work. I now have windows 10 and it turns out the solution was to to bring us the side bar (by hovering cursor in top right corner and dragging down) and selecting settings.
 Then go to the updates tab and click on the advanced settings. You then have to opt out of recording updates for other Microsoft products (so only receiving updates for windows) by unticking the box. I then tried to receive the update and it worked fine.

            <p>I also tried Xircal's method - no joy - plus another one from elsewhere on microsoft.com which involved some terrifying jibbling from the command line. &nbsp;And that didn't work either, and probably broke something into the bargain. &nbsp;I'm still on 8.1 having
 had 10 install itself after repeatedly being told not to - fortunately the option to reinstate 8.1 went without a hitch. &nbsp;I'm not the only person who has had a spontaneous installation either, but that's by the by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a whim I tried your suggestion of turning off updates for other MS products and stone me! &nbsp;It's actually working again! &nbsp;Though why it takes ten times as long to download a 30 MB load of updates as to download a 30 MB mod for Euro Truck Simulator 2 is
 still one of life's little mysteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the tip.</p>

    <title>Purchased used custom-built PC with Windows 10 Pro volume license - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mforner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchased used custom-built PC with Windows 10 Pro volume license version installed and it says my license is running out - where and how can I buy activation&#47;product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About five months ago I purchased a custom-built PC secondhand. It apparently had a volume license version of Windows 10 Pro installed. Of course, I thought it was a normal version until I received the pop-up notification that told me that my subscription
 would be expiring. I checked it and I have a month to renew, but I do not want to wait that long. I don't know the original activation key or where it was previously activated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am wondering what the best way to purchase a new activation/product key would be? I don't need to buy a copy of Windows 10 Pro with a CD or a full new download or anything since Windows 10 Pro is already installed on the computer...or do I?
<br />
If I can just buy a new activation key from Microsoft for Windows 10 Pro, that would be awesome! It would save me tons of time instead of having to totally reinstall Windows.&nbsp; Is this possible? When I go to the activation page it only has a link to "Change
 product key" and there is no link to the Microsoft store.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.&nbsp;<br />
Matthew&nbsp;</p>

            Hi. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems, but I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />You can purchase a new key here:

<br />
<br />You should be able to simply activate your current installation of Windows with no issues.

<h2>            Ctrl&#43;Shift&#43;T Beeping Noise</h2>
                    I have run into an issue with the Control+Shift+T command on my keyboard (the command that bring up previously deleted tabs). Every time I use the command, a beeping sound will happen after I press the T. It is only with this command that the beeping sound
 ever happens. I would like to know how to disable it. I have already checked if Sticky Keys are enabled, and they are not.<br />

<p>Hello Hobson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, make sure to turn off Filter Keys and Toggle Keys. To do this, go to
<strong><em>Settings</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>Ease of Access</em></strong> &gt; <strong>
<em>Keyboard </em></strong>&gt; <strong><em>Turn off Filter Keys and Toggle Keys.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know. Please confirm if you were able to perform the steps above. Also, may I ask what is the model of your keyboard? Have you tried using another keyboard and check if the issue still persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still experience the same issue while using a different keyboard, it's best to try

 profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please make sure that the <strong>Sound Scheme</strong> is set to
<strong>Windows Default</strong>. Kindly refer to the screenshot below:</p>

When I start or restart my computer and open windows mail I get this message; The message store has been corrupted by an application external to windows mail. Windows mail has been able to successfully recover from this corruption. (0x00000000) It restores
 all the messages from way back, but no content of the message is restored. This started happening after receiving an Email that I can not move to the recycling bin.&nbsp; How can I delete this message and get windows mail working properly.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck, it still the same. But i had try to disable XHCI from the BIOS, everything working fine. Look like my keyboard/mouse having issue when USB3 (xHCI) is set to "Enable", "Auto" or "Smart Auto". I not sure there is the problem with my keyboard/mouse
 or the problem with the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the NUC5i5RYH driver page, USB3 driver only available for Windows 7, i can't find it for Windows 10. I am currently using driver from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The only solution is disable xHCI from the BIOS.</p>

            Hi Chris.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a driver letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Hi Erik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the driver of your Media-Tech chase booster MT 176 is no longer compatible with Windows 10. For better assistance with the latest drivers of your steering wheel, would suggest that you contact the manufacturer of your device.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might arise Windows Update services are malfunctioning or the downloaded packages are corrupt. I would suggest you to try the following methods in Windows 7 system and then try installing the update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong><span> <span>Run the Windows Update troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Open the Windows

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install
 Windows 10 on a different PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Installing Older Software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janesdf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Older Software</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I have some older versions of software that have worked on all of my windows versions from Windows 95 to Windows XP Home Edition.&nbsp; HOWEVER, I just bought a new pc with Windows 7 Home Premium and my older software won't install, because "it is not compatible".&nbsp;
 I tried the troubleshoot for compatibility, followed all of the steps at least four times, and still my older software, which I really like working with, won't install.&nbsp; I also tried using XP Mode to install it, but found that it is not available for Windows
 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Between Windows 7 and XP Home Edition, I like XP better and would like to know how to downgrade to XP.&nbsp; My older computer had XP pre-installed so there is no CD that came with it.&nbsp; When I first bought my pc almost five years ago, I contacted
 Dell to get a restore CD and they outright refused to send one to me, and I tried for almost two weeks to get them to send it.&nbsp; Fortunately, except for age of my older pc, I never needed the CD, but it would have been nice to have in case.&nbsp; Anyway, how can
 I downgrade from Windows 7 back to XP Home Edition.&nbsp; And by the way, because there is no Windows XP CD, I can't backup my old drive to load all of my programs, program files, and documents to the new pc.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>You would need to go to the manufacturer of your Windows 7 computer and see if they have drivers for that model computer for Windows XP.
<br />
</p>
<p>If you have a Dell, go to Dell's website, go to Support Options. Click on Drivers and Downloads. Go to Home users, Then enter model number.&nbsp;It will ask for your operating system. If you don't see&nbsp;Windows XP, then they would not have drivers or software available
 for that model for that operating system. Then it would not be advisable to&nbsp;downgrade&nbsp;to Windows XP. You would need video drivers, audio drivers, controller drivers etc..</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps to explain the issue. Let me know if you still have questions. <br />

    <title>Temp folder WAY to big - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremypera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temp folder WAY to big</h2>
                    I use disc clean up every so often but this last time the temporary files section said there is 190gb of space it will free. Now normally this would be good, but since my hard drive is only about 230 gb and im using about 190, i think there may be a problem.
 Can anyone help?

Hi aworker7,</span> <strong><span><br />
<br />
UMBUS Root Bus enumerator</span> </strong><span>also known as
<strong>UserMode Root Bus enumerator</strong> is a part of Windows Vista. <span>&nbsp;</span>
<strong>UM Bus enumerator</strong> does what it sounds like it does - it enumerates devices on the various user-mode buses</span> .
<span>&nbsp;</span> Umbus.sys is the Universal Management Bus Enumerator driver. Umbus.sys is a 32-bit executable that requires no direct user interface.
<br />
<br />
Default location: %WinDir%\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\umbus.inf_6d285360\umbus.sys<br />
<br />
It should be there in your device manager. Nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards, <br />
Gulrez.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a question,&nbsp; I uninstalled my<strong> UMBus Enumerator and the UMBus Root Bus Enumerator from my Device manager</strong> .&nbsp; I did it because I read it would help resolve a error installing a printer for Windows 7 regarding the print spooler.&nbsp; Do I need
 to install these drivers again?&nbsp; How can I fix a print spooler error?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Something went wrong &#40;code&#58; 0x8009002d&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>This will happen at random but seems to be about every 3rd or 4th time I come back to my computer and try to log in. The screen will ask for my 4 digit code and after I do so a screen pops up that says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong (code: 0x8009002d). Restart your device to see if that fixes the problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restart and all is well until the next time I go to log in. This is EXTREMELY frustrating especially if your are working on something and you step away from your computer long enough for it to time out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>

            <p>So this problem seems to strictly be related to the 4 digit pin code. Since I wrote this question I have turned off the pin and have only used the password. I have not experienced any issue with being locked out of my computer or needing to restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said the PIN was nice but until Microsoft addresses this issue I would just recommend turning off the PIN and using the password.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same issue in the past and as of recent it has been happening way too often. I'm not sure why this glitch or malfunction happens in the first place but I would love a permanent solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the steps you suggested by going into "command prompt" and following the direction. It stated that there were no corrupt files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full error message and code that I am getting when I attempt to&nbsp;use my pin code&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>"Something went wrong (code: 0x8009002d). Restart your device to see if that fixes the problem."</p>
<p>I have also followed the above instruction by restarting my computer with no results. It now forces me to use my password versus using my pin code. This concerns me as it seems as though it may be a security issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You need to sign in not with your pin but with your full original password. You can only enter that if you select the option "sign-in options" below the input line for the digit code. Once "in" remove the pin code in sign-in options in settings. Reboot
 and then assign the pin code again. All corrupted pin code files will thus be repaired and your pin code will work fine until your next windows update that may require you to do the same again. Nothing is perfect ....

            FWIW, having used Windows 10 since it's introduction, this only has started happening on my system running Windows 10 Pro - other systems running Home don't exhibit this problem. Also, simply turning PIN off doesn't delete any associated files - corrupt
 or not.

<p>Almost helpful, but not quite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 'pin file'&nbsp; was corrupted, then&nbsp; it would always fail. Not just sometimes. Meaning the problem is deep than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the PIN code, and now know that is where the problem is and how to work around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is obvious that there is a problem in the Windows Hello functionality. Even if it is a corrupt file, it should cope and let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today is February 9th, 2018 - from more than a month and an update or two from MS, and still a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the work around though.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 is not syncing custom folders, only the default folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10, my install of Outlook 2013 fails to sync subfolders from my work mail server.</p>
<p>Inbox, Sent and Trash (default folders) all sync just fine and I'm able to send/receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when I drag an email to a subfolder, out of the inbox, it gets transferred to the folder but I'm unable to see it.</p>
<p>I've confirmed using other devices that the email is indeed in the subfolder but it doesn't show up on this specific Outlook install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails that do show up in the subfolders are emails that had synced prior to updating to Windows 10. Post Windows 10 emails no longer show up in the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I've tested my Outlook 2013 instance on my Windows 8.1 laptop and that works fine. It's just the Windows 10 install of Outlook 2013 that's failing to display new emails in subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Thofikh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It's an IMAP/SMTP account.</p>
<p>2. Outlook 2013 local mail client installed on my Win 10 PC.</p>
<p>3. This is the only email account I have set up in this instance of Outlook 2013. Any emails I file away into sub-folders aren't shown locally on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the emails on my other instance of Outlook 2013 on my Windows 8.1 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I launched Outlook in safe mode as per your recommendation and I still can't see any new emails in my subfolders after a send/receive. I'm able to receive emails to my inbox and send them just fine, but again, if I drag them to a subfolder I can no longer
 see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>vista dvd maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skola1  say:</h3>
<h2>            vista dvd maker</h2>
                    I am making a slide show with Vista dvd maker.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have currently used 65 of 150 minutes.&nbsp; I am trying to add music to slide show.&nbsp; In preview, the only music files that play are with "wma" extension.&nbsp; But only 1 wma audio file will play in preview. &nbsp;If
 I add "mp3" audio file, it&nbsp;does not play in preview.<br />
<br />
Research indicates the supported audio files for dvd maker are:<br />
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>‚Ä¢</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong><span>Audio files:</span></strong><span> .aif, .aifc,
 .aiff .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
Is there a limit to the number of audio files that can be added aslong as I do not exceed the remaining 85 minutes?<br />
Can you&nbsp;use multiple&nbsp;audio file types in the slide show?<br />
Do I need to convert the mp3 audio files to wma?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your assistance on this issue.<br />
<br />

 one of the solutions below will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>solution 1(easiest): </strong>
switch off your device</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the easiest and simplest option and does not need rolling back to win8.1 after painstaking hours I realised this was all I needed to do. NOTE* this is
<strong>not a restart! </strong>what you need to do is properly shut down the machine either through start&gt;power&gt;shutdown or power button on your device. leave the device
<strong>off </strong>for at least 1 minute. At restart one of three&nbsp;outcomes will be the case... 1.&nbsp;wifi works and you're immediately able to&nbsp;use the network (congradulations) 2. wifi works however you cannot join your home network and 3. wifi is still not
 present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if outcome 2. is the&nbsp;case, your wifi card (in my case the realtek RTL8723BE) <em>
should </em>now appear in the device manager and all you need to do is update your driver to the latest windows10 drivers from Lenovo (if not the latest 8.1 driver) and restart. (hopefully you now have wifi).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>solution 2: </strong>roll back to windows 8.1 and remove interfering software</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>the most apparent culprit is Cisco VPN software/drivers these seem not to be compatible with windows 10 and after upgrade are affecting network connectivity. solutions on how to remove these are in the following thread:</p>

            <p>Unfortunately this didn't seem to help.&nbsp; I can connect to the WiDi device but in environments that have a lot of WiFi traffic such as work, the WiDi device does not stay connect to the surface for very long. It will drop connection a lot.&nbsp; But at home with
 little to no WiFi traffic I can connect to the WiDi device for hours with no dropped connection.</p>

    <title>Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials limits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathandelgado_86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials limits</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a security camera integrator and I'm not completely familiar with Windows Servers. Our customer wanted a couple recorders (where the video management software (VMS) and video is stored) to run Windows Server 2012. Our server hardware provider complied
 and sent us servers running Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials. The issue we ran into is that the server is shutting down on it's own. Logs show it due to a license issue and there is an entry in BPA that states to change the number of connections to an allowable
 value. Our VMS provider said it is due to the limitations of Essentials only allowing 25 devices total. That includes cameras recording and PCs accessing the server. We have about 35 cameras recording to each server. Which is why they recommend the standard
 version. Our server provider says he hasn't heard about that limitation and doesn't think that's the reason for the server shutting down. So is there a limitation to devices on a Essentials server, not just users. And if we do need to upgrade to the standard
 version would we essentially need a CAL for each camera and PC connected to the server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Jonathan</p>

<p>.Net Framework get install along with Window installation. This issue may arise if there is some corruption in .Net Framework file while installation. I suggest you to try downloading and installing .Net Framework 3.5 manually and check if it works. To do
 so kindly refer the below given link and download the framework.</p>

            Thank you for the help it did not work but I restored it to the factory settings and then updated it to windows 10 and it finally worked. I wish I would have just done that sooner. You gave me&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp; a clean install and I am just so happy with it
 now. Thank you
