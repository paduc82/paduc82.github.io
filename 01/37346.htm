<h2>            An external hard disk that is based on the IEEE 1394 standard is not detected on a Windows 7 but is detected from USB</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive (WD My book 1TB) which is not detected via IEEE 1394 standard on Windows 7 but is detected via USB.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When connected via IEEE 1394 it doesnt appear in My Computer but appears in Disk Management. In Disk Management it doesnt allow to assign a drive or open properties and brings up an error message that Disk Management is not uptodate. Refresh it. This doesnt
 resolve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice?</div>

<h2>            Audio issues with Windows 10 August Update</h2>
                    <p>Since KB4343909 Windows 10 update (August), I got some issues related to audio. The system itself has sound and I can listen to it but there's no sound in some programs, namely Spotify and games. Also, I can't watch videos with Edge and Explorer (not supported
 error message) but everything works fine in other browsers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already reinstalled and updated the audio driver several times, used the command Sfc /scannow, tried to scan and repair C drive, installed the update again and nothing works. I thought about recovering but I can't reach a point before the first installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody got a solution?</p>

            Hi Val.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Dell laptop backlit keyboard doesn&#39;t sleep any more</h2>
                    <p>Hi,My laptop is a Dell&nbsp;inspiron 5765 running Windows 10. My laptop did some updates yesterday and now the backlight on the keyboard won't sleep any more. I can get it to turn on and off, and I can change the time in which the keyboard should sleep, but no
 change. I've restarted with no luck either. I really don't want to roll back the updates, but if I have to I will. That's a lot of updates to roll back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>

            Also, it doesn't change if I unplug it. I have also noticed some flicking coming from the keyboard when it is in dim setting. I have updated all drivers and run trouble shooting which still didn't change anything.

<p>Hi Tara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the recent update made the function incompatible or corrupt. Since you have already tried updating drivers and still have the issue, we suggest updating your device's BIOS firmware. It is best to contact Dell directly regarding the BIOS
 updates as they have the information on how to do it and to avoid any mistakes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I understand you, but it sounds as if you may be in "overtype" mode.&nbsp; How you turn this on and off may depend on the version of Word you are using.&nbsp; In Word 2003, the Status Bar (at the bottom of the screen) shows 4 boxes with the following
 letters:&nbsp; REC TRK EXT OVR.&nbsp; Normally, all of these boxes are dimmed.&nbsp; If you doubleclick on one of the boxes, the letters become bold, indicating that the mode has been turned on.&nbsp; If OVR is shown in bold, doubleclick to turn it off.</p>
<p>If this isn't what you meant, or if you are using a version of Word that doesn't show overtype mode as described, post your question in the<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordcreate/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word Forum</a> .&nbsp; Don't forget to specify
 what version of Word you have.</p>

<p>I have added videos that I am editing to movie maker however not ALL of the files will load.</p>
<p>They're from the same camera, shot on the same day so obviously the codec can't change itself mid stream.</p>

From your problem description I understand that you are facing issues in deleting files from recycle bin.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Please provide us with the additional information by answering a few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.<br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><strong>Note</strong>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If that does not fix the issue then Run Disk clean up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow. <br />
&nbsp; 2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
<strong>cleanmgr</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">The cleanmgr command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

<p>

You can also run a Virus Scan on the computer to make it is free from viruses.<br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Lexmark technical support offers live chat or you can call them at&nbsp;800-332-4120.</p>

</p><p>P.S. I don't work for Lexmark and I don't own anything made by Lexmark. I simply searched the web. You try it:

            <p>Hello,<br />
Still in the same position.&nbsp; I couldn't access Lexmark support website either ,despite 3 separate emails, pleading for assistance...maybe it is now defunct. or i am doing something wrong!!&nbsp; I couldnt&nbsp; locate any suitable driver from lexmark support...maybe
 none available yet..can anyone advise on this?</p>
<p>Does Microsoft provide&nbsp; any free telephone consultation service for account holders in the uk and how do I access this from the UK.<br />
I cannot believe my printer,which was working perfectly well,is now redundant as a result of windows 10 upgrade.<br />
Surely such a big corporation can help solve this problem... i am sure&nbsp; i am not the only one in this position!!<br />
&nbsp;Any help or guidance/signposting link appreciated as i am thoroughy dispirited with the consequences of the upgrade ..it is difficult not to be cynical about it all.</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

            It looks like Lexmark doesn't have Windows 10 specific drivers available for this device but you could try the windows 8 version to see if that works.

</p><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for a bit of help here. I've bought some old games that I use to play years ago probably on windows 2000 or xp. One of the games has installed properly but when I click to play it for some reason it loads then comes back out to my desktop.
 Can anyone help here? I use to play this game a lot when I was a lot younger want to revisit my past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>If you haven't already, then try playing around with the 'Compatibility Settings' -
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6832-compatibility-mode-use-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6832-compatibility-mode-use-windows-8-a.html</a> and see if they help. Theres more than one way to set them, and the manual way has quite a few options so try both
<em>(probably ignore Option 3 unless you are happy with regedit)</em>. The compatibility settings can get some older programs running on a later version of windows, so its worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was also an MS update to W8.1 and W7 that stopped some older games from running. I had this on an game I played. See -
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/kb3086255-is-this-a-half-baked-solution-or-am-i/13d4c03e-f04f-40b9-b438-e903eda3cab9">

 to be in the drive to play, then <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB3086255</a> may be the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some older games just will not run at all on later windows OS. Depends on what games they are for someone to be specific.</p>

<p>Hi Dennis - I am so sorry I missed this reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent change that I suspect is causing this is hooking both my home and work PC's up to the same monitor/keyboard/mouse using a kvm switch. While my work PC is connected to use both monitors, my home computer is only connected to one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I haven't had any resolution problems on that monitor when I switch back/forth between computers. It's only the notifications that appear mostly off-screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To your questions, below is a screenshot to illustrate, with the Windows Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.726)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 continually freezes</h2>
                    I have a recurring problem during and after installation of Windows7. Windows 7 continually freezes. When I search events using event viewer, I find that the error&nbsp; "The DgiVecp service failed to start due to the following error: The system cannot find
 the device specified", almost always shows up at the time at which the computer freezes, shuts down or restarts. On searching forums for an answer I see that there has been a few people with the same error but find no real answers. I have replaced drivers
 for a samsung printer, which was suggested. I have also tried replacing hardware as well, everything but the MB and RAM. New hard drives with new installation of OS. Still no luck. I could just get a new system, though I would rather find out what the problem
 is. Is there anyone there that knows of the problem and is willing to help?<br />

<p>You might use Autoruns to disable the startup item producing this error.</p>
<p><span>To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/Autoruns.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/Autoruns.mspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can
 recheck to re-enable the item. It is a much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.<br />
Another useful feature of the programme is that you can right click an item and select Search Online to get information about the item selected.</span></p>

<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot into Safe mode and check whether the issue persists.</p>
<p>a. Restart the system and keep tapping F8 till you reach the boot menu.</p>
<p>b. Select Safe mode from the list and press Enter.</p>
<p>c. Check whether the issue persists.</p>

<h2>            Help&#58; Windows 10 screen unresponsive, but cursor, taskbar and taskmanager works.</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if it's a bug or hardware issue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new dell low-range gaming laptop and I run several high performance architecture softwares on it. After about one-two years of uni, the laptop started to act up occasionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Unresponsive screen, cursor moves but no response for clicks</p>
<p>2. Only the bottom part of the screen (taskbar region) is responsive to cursor moving and clicks</p>
<p>3. Ctrl+alt+del page is responsive, cursor responsive and clicks will respond after a few tries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solves itself when I click on task manager, with task manager running, everything else starts to work normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to google a solution but have a tough time trying to describe it. I thought the problem is unique to my laptop until I met another coworker who has the same issue on his desktop computer (bootcamp on imac). He also instinctively resolves
 the same problem by running the task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried giving it a clean install but the problem still persists even when all the softwares are wiped out.</p>
<p>Any idea on ways to fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Joy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  You can wait for release of Version 1903 shortly.
<br />
<br />4) Compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link have ever come back to report problems that I have seen.   It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. You can also make it a diagnostic install by monitoring after each group of Updates, each app and program install, and each settings and other change to see if you can isolate when the problem begins and what might be responsible.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows will defrag your drive when it feels good and ready. Meanwhile, the amount of time you spend on manually defragmenting will far outweigh any performance gain you will realize. Hard drives these days are that good.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It does not matter whether it reads 0 or 100% as the System Partition has zero effect on the performance of your computer. Defragging it would be a total waste of time.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>What is then the purpose of defragment if it has no effect on a 100% Fragmented System? I tried to run it on my laptop but the defragment will only go as far as 3%.</span></span></p>

            There is no reason to defrag the "System" partition as it is not used to run Windows. It is where recovery files and other recovery static type files are placed as needed which are almost never read.<br />

<p>Anything with every bloody file fragmented will not be running efficiently. If allocating more space writes it out again I would agree. As poorly done and not ready for release as this operating system turned out... If the SYSTEM partition is not a part
 of running the machine then how is it kept current? When would it update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side issue; I usually use an external monitor but when disconnected the laptop screens stays black. Same when I change from extended to duplicate. Various keystroke combinations from HP and Elitebook 8440p manual have no effect.&nbsp;

            The system file is rarely written to and it is not accessed during the usual Windows operations.<br />

It has zero impact on performance.<br />

            <p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Disconnect the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1: I would suggest you to perform Check Hard Drive using the DVD in Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) for File System Errors in Windows 8.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer</p>
<p>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</p>
<p>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</p>
<p>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click <b>Next</b> and select <b>Repair the computer</b>.</p>
<p>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Desktop mode, you click on Computer or Click on Libraries.</p>
<p>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this step, you can select the Hard Drive what you want and right-click on it and select the properties.</p>
<p>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this step, first you click on the Tool tab. You click on the Check Button under the Error Checking.</p>
<p>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After clicking Check Button, it shows Scan Drive. If any errors are found then you can decide if want to fix them.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2: I would suggest you to try booting the computer in Safe Mode and Clean Boot,</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1: Safe Mode</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</b></p>

<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Note: Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand your frustration and we help you the best way we can. From what I understand you are receiving error that the file you are trying to import in Movie Maker&nbsp;or PowerPoint&nbsp;is not supported. Is this correct? This error message typically occur if
 the format of the file that you are trying to import is not included in the list of supported file types of Movie Maker. &nbsp;To eliminate this symptom, we recommend that you check the file type of the video that you are trying to import in Movie Maker and see
 if it is included&nbsp;on the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link on where you can check the list of file types:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>What kind of files can I use in Movie Maker?</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case that your file is not included on the list, you will need to convert that file into a supported file type in order to use it on Movie Maker. You may search for any available freeware converters using your preferred search engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of importing the video file on PowerPoint, we recommend that you create another thread on Microsoft Office forum for proper assistance.</p>

            You need to make sure you have actually rendered a playable video file out of Expression Encoder 4.&nbsp; If, for example, you have done a video screen capture, you must then use Expression Encoder 4 to turn that into a .wmv file which should then be usable
 in both Movie Maker and PowerPoint.

            <p>During the tablet's initial setup, it may have corrupted and did not install.&nbsp; When I mentioned on 'searching', I mean the Internet itself (globally).&nbsp; There are a ton of open source fonts out in the wild that are fully compatible with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your fonts for Windows are located in a folder under "Windows" when you launch the File Manager and double-click on "Local Drive C:" under "This PC".&nbsp; Generally, that font is in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy that font from your regular Windows 8 PC onto a USB pendrive and then copy it into or right-click on it when you insert the pendrive into the tablet and tell it to "Install".&nbsp; All it does is move it into the Font folder for the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are missing any other fonts, you can do the same for those as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When these tablets setup, sometimes they 'glitch' and don't install everything or sometimes a file or two will be corrupted during the retrieval.&nbsp; I never checked Microsoft Office for what fonts it includes and that font may or may not be part of the set.&nbsp;
 It think it is from the system itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any exotic fonts, do a web search and you will find a lot of free ones out there that are pretty good.&nbsp; I do that when I do something for holidays and flyers.&nbsp; Just don't add too many, though.</p>

    <title>Removing original administrator from laptop so I can reset it to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekf16  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing original administrator from laptop so I can reset it to myself</h2>
                    <p>I purchased this Lenovo Ideapad 320 as a gift for my former girlfriend (as well as myself) and allowed her (being the good guy that I am) to create the initial set-up in which she had the only Admin privilege (which looking back now was not smart).&nbsp; It is
 set up with Microsoft Office Windows 10.&nbsp; Of course I kept the laptop after our sour breakup and now can not complete any tasks where an Admin privilege is necessary, such as downloading the hardware for my new Brother printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not much of a computer tech dude and do not have a lot of patience or know-how to try to remove her and grant Admin to myself.&nbsp; Every search I have tried basically shows that I must be an Admin to create a new Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there somebody that can tell me if this is something that I could accomplish on my own, as I am extremely frustrated?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Contacting her is not an option, if there are any wiseguys out there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has hijacked my PC - taken over my administrator rights</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Ever since updating to Windows 10 I have been annoyed daily by the fact that admission to my own computer is only possible by using my &nbsp;Microsoft password / logging in to my Microsoft account. My old personal administrator password used in Windows 8 is no
 longer valid. Plain and simple - the adminstrator account and my PC has simply been hijacked by Microsoft - this is in any way not all right.</p>
<p>How do I remove this connection between access to my own PC and logging in to my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two kinds of user accounts in Windows 10: <em>Microsoft account</em> and
<em>local account</em>. If your user account is connected to your Microsoft account, you will need to sign-in using your Microsoft password. With a Microsoft account, you can use Windows Store and install apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A local account is a user account that is not connected to a Microsoft account. This
<span>is a username and password combination that you use to log in to any legacy Windows operating systems.</span> For a more detailed comparison, you may refer to the following thread:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/microsoft-account-vs-local-account-on-windows-10/da6826f7-5e9b-48bf-8e0d-bf25456b4e0e?auth=1">
Microsoft Account vs. Local Account on Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your user account was converted to a Microsoft account, you could easily switch it back to a local account by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and open the <strong>Settings </strong>app by clicking on the cog icon.</li><li>Go to <strong>Accounts</strong>, and then select <strong>Your Info</strong>. Verify that you are logged in using a Microsoft Account.</li><li>Click on <strong>Sign in with a local account instead</strong>. Enter your current Microsoft Account password to authenticate, and hit
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select a new username and password for your local account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to post a reply.</p>

</p><p><span>Having read an awfull lot of articles, procedures, watched youtube etc. – tried a lot of the advices, I finally deactivated my administrator
 user account </span><span>☹</span><span> -
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d2b8005-7a0d-48c1-8e1b-fd528fd0e1d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d2b8005-7a0d-48c1-8e1b-fd528fd0e1d1" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I never should have done. I did expect that the Microsoft logon would disappear and instead I could use my old password. But no - No more access to my computer at all. I spent all afternoon trying out all sorts of password combinations,
 recover password procedures found on several web sites including Microsoft, apps etc. Nothing did help and since I haven’t made a recovery boot disk and in this way was able to get access to my computer, it looked like a total disaster – an evitable reinstallation
 of win 10 roared it’s ugly face and at the same time I would have to say goodbye to a large number of personal files, a lots of apps and some heavy time consuming work of reinstallation. In the end I did remember the old safe mode functionality and the possibility
 of turning back time. Eventually it cured my computer and I have now gained access to my computer again.</span></p>
<p><span>BUT DEAR MICROSOFT HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT IT IS A FAIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS – SELLING A PRODUCT TO A CUSTOMER AND THEN AFTERWARDS HIJACK HIS OWN PROPERTY BY TAKING OVER ALL CONTROL OF THE ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS – THIS IS NOT RIGHT
 AND I STILL WANT TO KNOW – <strong>HOW TO REMOVE THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN ACCESS TO MY OWN PC AND LOGGING IN TO MY MICROSOFT ACCOUNT.</strong></span></p>

</p><p>1&nbsp; You seem to be looking in the wrong place within Settings, Accounts judging from your screenshots.&nbsp; When you use Settings, Accounts it lands you on the correct tab which is labelled Your info in the English version.&nbsp; That is where you ought to be able
 to see the option to sign-in to a local account instead - you might find <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/i-made-the-mistake-of-using-my-hotmail-login-and/1d8396f6-3b34-42bb-bc56-0c8434cb328b">
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; I suppose it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">might</span> be possible that this problem of redirection to&nbsp;LUSRMgr&nbsp;is caused by user profile corruption.&nbsp; That can only be proved by creating a new account and seeing if that behaves correctly.&nbsp; Create
 a new account using an elevated command prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the username&nbsp;<em>NewAdmin</em> with a password
<em>12345 </em>here&nbsp;by way of&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px">Open a <em>Command prompt</em> - click on the <em>Start</em> button, scroll down&nbsp;&amp; click on

    <title>what is the max number of remote&#47;local profiles allowed on windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venator low  say:</h3>
<h2>            what is the max number of remote&#47;local profiles allowed on windows 7 enterprise&#63;</h2>
                    I have an environment of 1000 workstations for 3000 operators to work round the clock (24x7) at 4 different sites. Usually, 3 operators will assigned to a particular workstation, who will work on it during their respective shift work. However, sometime
 due machine faulty or change of shift timing, some of the operators will have to be re-allocated. other scenarios, like permanent change of location to alternative sites is also possible.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to know if there's a top limit to the windows profiles on the workstation, or it's just limited by harddisk space, so that I can plan for the administration operation required e.g. profile mgmt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<h2>            BugCheck 3D error while using a 3D application Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Windows 7 X64 bsod | BugCheck 3B, {c0000005, fffff960002335db, fffff8800b0f1c10, 0}</p>
<p>Lately I'm getting bluescreens whenever I'm using a 3D application and try to leave it in any sort of way. I get a bluescreen when I exit/alt+tab/switch to desktop in another manner e.g. a game. I think it might have something to do with my graphics card
 but that does not explain why I get no problems at all running 3D applications (that probably use DX or OpenGL).</p>
<p>Also I think it's worth telling the pc has never ever had bsod's except from this exact procedure of running a 3D application and then quitting it or switching back to windows. Also the errors seemed to be caused by Kaspersky Internet Security (closing that
 would help) but after uninstalling the program the issues aren't solved. Also I did a complete reinstall which did not fix the problem either.</p>
<p>The memory has also been tested with MemtestX86 and it found no errors.</p>
<p>Because this is probably a hardware/driver error I'll give my system specs:</p>
<p>Intel i7 core 930</p>
<p>OCZ 6x2 GB DDR 3 Memory</p>
<p>Gigabyte X58A-UD7 motherboard</p>
<p>Intel x25 160GB SSD</p>
<p>Nvidia 260GTX using the latest display drivers (258.96)</p>
<p>The Windows version I'm running is Windows 7 X64 Ultimate.</p>
<p>I've added the minidumps the crashes created on skydrive:</p>
<p>Minidumps: http://cid-3343a00d429e9dac.office.live.com/embedicon.aspx/.Public/Minidump.zip</p>
<p>And the unexpected shutdown window says this:</p>
<p>Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />

Kaspersky could easily be responsible for this issue in todo or at least part. Try uninstalling it<br />
and run the removal tool to be sure no remnants are left behind which can cause strange issues.</p>

<strong>The Nvidia drivers are directly linked to the 2nd BSOD.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />

If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
